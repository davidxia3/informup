Christine Ryan Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters Michael Gerber and Deputy Chief Gregory Clifford Commanding
Officer of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning as well as other members of my executive staff thank you
for the opportunity to testify today on the NYPD's fiscal year 2026 executive
budget in March we provided a comprehens we provided comprehensive testimony on many topics ranging from crime reduction
strategies to internal NYPD reforms to public safety legislation today we are
here to provide updates on some of those issues and to discuss more ways that we can work together on behalf of all the
people that we serve major crime in New York City continues to go down in our precincts and our subways and in our
housing developments nypd officers have taken more than 2,000 illegal 2,200
illegal guns off our streets in 2025 and nearly 22,000 since the Adams
administration began this has helped drive down citywide shooting incidents by 20% from this point last year and the
NYPD's work in May has been exceptional we just had the safest Memorial Day weekend in terms of gun violence that
New York City has ever seen with the fewest shootings in recorded history and
zero shootings on that Sunday the first time that has happened in the 32 years
that we have been keeping records and with two full days remaining in the month we are on track to have the fewest
murders and the fewest shootings for any May on record this is the result of
smart strategy thoughtful execution precise analysis and 49,000 people all
focused on one thing public safety and that focus on crime fighting is at the heart of our summer violence reduction
plan this plan continues the work that has made our neighborhood subways and housing development safer through the
expansion of our citywide zones as we have seen over the past several months
this datadriven scalpel approach works throughout our zone deployments in some
of our city's most violent areas major crime is down nearly 20% year-to- date
now we have expanded and repositioned our deployments based on current data crime trends and community concerns the
result is 70 summer zones covering 57 different commands across all five
bureaus this is the largest deployment of its kind in department history 1,500
uniformed officers on footposts in precincts public housing and in our subways and all of them focused on high
priority index crimes and shootings the summer is just getting underway but the
early results of this plan are quite promising since May 5th major crime in
our summer zones during deployment is down nearly 30% with double-digit decreases in robbery felony assault
burglary grand lararseny and autotheft shootings are down more than 57% and
major subway crime within these zones is down 29% just as I loed the NYPD successes
fighting crime I'm equally candid about the challenges that we still face whether it is surging recidivism faults
in the discovery law or the proliferation of illegal firearms we must deal with every issue directly and
honestly and that includes juvenile gun violence two weeks ago a 16-year-old
girl was killed by a stray bullet fired into a group of children by a 14-year-old boy who was handed the gun
by a 13-year-old boy it was a tragedy but it was not an aberration from 2018
to 2024 the number of children under the age of 18 arrested with a gun increased by
136% new York City over the same time shooters under the age of 18 went up by
92% and young shooting victims increased 81% why what happened among the factors
the first part of New York state's raise the age law took effect in 2018 the legislation changed both the age of
criminal responsibility and the way teenage offenders are processed in the courts the idea behind this was one that
we can all agree with children should not be treated like adults in our criminal justice system but as the law
took effect here's what we saw when the age of criminal responsibility went up the age of criminal suspects went down
gangs and crews began recruiting younger and younger members and had them carry
the guns and commit the shootings the robberies the
assaults now it's 60% and we cannot forget when more
shooters are kids more shooting victims are kids too this is serious and
seriously bad things come from a consequence-free environment over the
next year we need to have honest conversations about how the criminal justice system deals with youth offenders because the current trajectory
is unsustainable and unsafe i do not come here with all the answers but I do
look forward to working with the council on effective youth strategies in the first quarter of this year shootings in
New York City fell to their lowest level ever we had the second fewest homicides in recorded history there were
double-digit crime declines across patrol transit and housing the public safety gains made by the men and women
of the NYPD were truly historic but even as crime and violence fell New Yorkers were telling us they still did not feel
safe chronic conditions in their neighborhoods like abandoned vehicles homeless encampments illegal parking
unreasonable noise public drinking and urination and open air drug markets give the impression of chaos and disorder
they make people feel unsafe and calls to 311 concerning quality of life issues
nearly doubled in the past six years so in direct response to these increased 311 complaints the NYPD launched the
quality of life division in midappril reentering our approach to public
safety across six commands helping to clear block driveways and bike lanes settle noise complaints and keep our
public spaces safe and orderly and they have ensured that these issues are addressed promptly and do not languish
for days this work is having a real impact in less than six weeks the quality of life division has seized more
than 200 illegal mopeds and rec recklessly operated
ebikes derelict or unregistered vehicles cleared around 440 encampments and
inspected more than 400 smoke shops padlocking around 50 of them in 2025
quality of life enforcement is not about preventing more serious crime in fact it is not about crime at all it is about
improving quality of life being responsive to community complaints and fixing the very real issues people are
dealing with every day including out of control ebikes every person is obligated
to follow the very basic rules of the road when it comes to traffic safety compliance is not optional we will not
tolerate ebikes driving recklessly running red lights ignoring stop signs driving on the sidewalk and riding
against traffic residents have consistently raised fears about serious injury or worse and this enforcement
initiative is in direct response to those clear concerns and the enforcement
looks different now for one simple reason our previous approach wasn't working b summones returnable to traffic
court are part of a regulatory framework designed for licensed car drivers if you
ignore a B summon you have your license suspended if you are a menace on the roads and accumulate enough points on
your license it will be suspended none of this makes any sense for ebikes because a license is not required to
operate one so instead for certain hazardous offenses we are issuing C
summones returnable to criminal law and we are eager to work
with the council and the state legislature on a new meaningful paradigm for biking enforcement but I want to be
clear far from being a war on ebikes this enforcement initiative is designed to keep these vehicles as a viable and
sustainable transportation option in New York City there is a desperate need for
legislative reform to keep pace with the reality on the streets and to the extent
that has not happened yet it is created dangerous conditions the NYPD is is
responsible for keeping people safe consistent with the law and we will continue to do so in 2025 the NYPD has
issued nearly 251,000 summones to cars versus about
5,100 summones to ebikes so clearly this initiative is only one part of our
larger effort to ensure safe streets for all New Yorkers work that is saving lives this year traffic fatalities are
down 24% and collision injuries are down 12% and every vehicle type collision
category is down year to date with one exception and that is ebikes the NYPD
depends on the public trust that trust is built by unimpeachable integrity and it is maintained by strong ethical
leadership over the past five months we have reshaped our executive leadership amended our vehicle pursuit policy
reduced waste and redundancy in our vehicle fleet and returned more than a thousand cops from administrative roles
back to patrol we continue to enhance efficiency appro improve policy and
reinforce accountability when I was last here I said that we were focused on our disciplinary
proing that it is fair and effective that means having an internal affairs
bureau that identifies and re roots out cases of misconduct and having a department advocates office that
prosecutes those cases rigorously it also means that we must have a thorough and consistent process when the CCB
substantiates allegations of misconduct when I started in this position I became
concerned that some of our procedures for CCB cases had come unmed from the
principles that guide our disciplinary system we needed to make changes and we did for example paragraph 2 of our of
our 2012 with the CCB states that when the CCB is seeking charges and
specifications against an officer there are certain circumstances in which the police commissioner can retain
In particular I can take this step when there are ongoing parallel or related criminal investigations or in the
interests of justice when an officer has no disciplinary history or prior substantiated CCB complaints but just
because I can do something does not always mean that I should i am committed
to being thoughtful about when I exercise this authority and I have been last year the department took
year that number is 13 and until a few months ago we were imposing a short so
rule that administratively closed hundreds of CCB cases that came to us shortly before the statute of
limitations expired i ordered the Department Advocates Office to reverse that policy decision and eliminate that
rule my directive is clear cases should not be closed on technicalities and we must make substantial efforts to review
every case brought to us by the CCB in 2024 848 CCB cases were closed because
of short so since we made this change on March 1st there have only been three
going forward that number can be zero and it should be but I want to be clear
the CCB needs to do its part here our department advocates office is making herculean efforts to process cases
quickly in some instances we only have days and this is not fair to the
officers or to the complaintants we urge the CCB to review its own procedures and
to take steps to process cases expeditiously discipline is important
even more important is to improve our practices so that we get it right and that there is no need for discipline my
team is working closely and collaboratively with the federal monitor to achieve the goals of the monitorship
and to ensure that our stop question and frisk practices are constitutionally sound that is why at compliance stat we
are laser focused on the constitutionality of stops frisks and searches conducted by our officers
were lawful compared to 82% in the first quarter we also improved over that time
when it comes to frisks 79% compliance versus 62% and searches 78% compliance
versus 67% through compliance stat we can and will push th those compliance stat rates
even higher when we talk about stops we also must acknowledge long-standing racial disparities the monitor has found
that controlling for various factors such as the crimes being investigated when it comes to a variety of posttop
outcomes such as frisks searches arrests summones use of force and the recovery
of contraband or weapons racial disparities over time have been substantially reduced or been eliminated
entirely for the stops themselves racial disparities remain and we are working
with the monitor to formulate a 14th amendment compliance plan that will tackle that issue head on when it comes
to constitutional policing we are proud of our successes and cleareyed about the challenges that remain we will continue
to identify where we fall short and implement ways to be better new Yorkers
deserve nothing less as you know I am committed to the efficient and appropriate use of overtime at the NYPD
and our overtime management plan is achieving that goal in the first half of fiscal year 2025 the NYPD's overtime
spending was about 11% above the previous year now we have not only
slowed that trend we have reversed it since the plan was implemented each
month has seen significant reductions in overtime spending year-over-year when compared to the same month in 2024
January overtime spending was down 9.7% february was down 10.1% March was
down 14% and April was down 15% you can clearly see the improving
trend as the plan has been honed and refined over time and these res reductions resulted in combined savings
of $40.4 million over the first four months of 2025 compared to last year
overall with this renewed focus and enhanced compliance measures we anticipate that our overtime spending
will be lower than the target established with the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year 2025 and significantly lower than it
would have been if no measures were taken in January to be clear none of
this has come at the expense of public safety we continue to do all the necessary work to reduce crime and
improve quality of life no one does it better than the women and men of the NYPD but it is no secret that we need
more of them and as I have said before this is not a budget problem we have the
will and we have the means but lately we do not have the applicants the result is
an 11% drop in NYPD uniformed headcount over the past seven years it's simple
more cops on patrol make our city safer hiring a thousand recruits in January of this year was a good start but it was
not nearly enough so we expanded our eligibility requirements reducing the number of college credits needed to
apply from 60 down to 24 this brought the NYPD more in line with modern standards since most of our
peer agencies do not require any college credits at all those changes took effect in February and the impact was immediate
in the past few months more than 12,600 new filers have registered to take the police officer exam and more than 4,000
previously ineligible applicants moved to reopen their cases daily applications
are up 75% going from an average of 56 per day up to 98 and about 4,100 people
have registered for the next police exam this gives us a fighting chance to reach Mayor Adams goal of 35,000 uniform
officers by the fall of next year a headcount that we haven't seen since
2022 our department's goal is to hire about 35 new officers in 2025 continuing
the year-over-year increases from the 2041 hires in 2022 2356 in 2023 and 2631
in 2024 this is good news for our city but we kn we need the news to be even
better increased headcount means less overtime less stress in our workforce and better service for New Yorkers i am
confident that we can get there and we appreciate the mayors and the council's support in this effort there are many
other areas as well where the NYPD and the city council can work together to increase public safety and dramatically
improve the quality of life in our city first we propose a change to the administrative code to make it a
misdemeanor to possess an ATV within the confines of New York City though ATVs cannot be legally operated on New York
City roadways they can be legally possessed making enforcement of the law challenging second we need to revisit
the law regarding groups wearing masks in public what was a public health necessity 5 years ago has now become an
easy way for criminals to hide their identities and we cannot allow this to continue the members of the NYPD and the
New York City Council want the same thing a safe city for all whenever possible we should be working together
toward that shared goal and I am eager to partner with you on any policies and legislation get that gets us closer to
achieving it and finally the council has before a bill that would ban the department's criminal group database we
spoke about this at our hearing in March and since then the database has continued to play a critical role in keeping our city safe this intelligence
tool helps us to understand crew related violence and identify potential retaliation targets after a shooting
simply put this investigative tool helps the NYPD save lives we saw this in late
April when we announced a major gang takeown with the Southern District where a long-term investigation led to the
indictment of 27 TDA members on charges including racketeering and sex
trafficking every single person indicted was listed in the database similar gang
cases were recently closed in Queens and Manhattan this year with help from the database including the early May assault
in Times Square against our cops by Los Diablo's a splinter set of TDA several
of those suspects were listed in the database which aided in their swift apprehension i have been clear and
consistent on this if you want to work with us to improve the database we are eager to sit down and discuss this
together but don't eliminate it doing so will make our city and its people less safe now I will speak briefly about a
topic on the minds of many New Yorkers and that is immigration enforcement under city law we are not allowed to
participate in or assist in civil immigration enforcement and we do not we
have been very clear and consistent on this and our officers understand that this is a red line that we cannot cross
at the same time we will continue to target criminals regardless of their immigration status as permitted by law
we work daily on criminal investigations with federal law enforcement through various task forces and that partnership
requires that we share information that is what it means to conduct to conduct a joint investigation and to work
collaboratively with our federal partners some have asked whether we should reconsider our cooperation with
federal agencies on criminal investigations in light of their work with ICE the short straight answer to
this is no working with our federal partners on criminal matters is crucial to the safety of our city we are talking
about cases to protect our city from terrorism saving children from exploitation and sex trafficking and
combating transnational criminal organizations the only way these investigations are successful is by NYPD
detectives working seamlessly with federal agents on a daily basis interfering with that work would be
disastrous for the people of New York City now let me be clear i am nobody's
fool if we were to find that a federal agency had not been honest with us if we
were told that a record's request was for a criminal investigation but in fact that was not true then that would be a
tremendous breach of our trust and we would need to reconsider how we do business with that federal agency i have
been very upfront about that with all of our federal partners but my experience
has been just the opposite we have an incredibly good relationship with our federal partners a relationship built on
mutual respect and trust i know that I value that relationship and I know that my federal counterparts feel the same
way now turning to the mayor's executive budget and its impact on the NYPD in the
coming fiscal year in totality the NYPD's fiscal year 2026 expense budget
is $6.14 billion the vast majority of which or 92% is as allocated for
personnel costs the remaining 8% is dedicated to non-personnel costs which include costs for technology that
provides officers with immediate access to critical data and applications safety equipment our response vehicles and
facilities we are grateful for the additional new funding of 322.9 million included as part of the
executive budget which is for the following in the current fiscal year only 301.8 million to address our
structural overtime shortfall in the current fiscal year and 21.1 million
toward the department's structural technology funding shortfall mayor Adams has proven his commitment to public
safety again and again and again and the NYPD is thankful for his continued
support in addition to the department's operating budget our 10-year capital strategy includes 1.55 billion for
fiscal years 2025 through 2035 this funding is critical for facility
construction projects over 698 million or 45% of the
capital budget including a renovated firearms training facility communications and other information
technology infrastructure over 428 million or 28% and large vehicle life
cycle replacements including ESU trucks tow trucks boats and
helicopters 385 million or 25% % while we have not yet experienced any direct
impact on our federal funding levels under the new administration we are closely monitoring any directives and
new grant guidance federal funding while only making up 3.7% of our overall
budget covers critical functions within the department on average the NYPD receives just under $200 million each
year in new federal grant funding and the majority of that support historically comes from the US
Department of Homeland Security the DHS grants enhance the department's counterterrorism capabilities especially
in the transit system and at our ports these grant funds have supported counterterrorism efforts by funding the
department's efforts to among other priorities deploy officers within the transit system and train officers to
respond to chemical ordinance biological and rad
the federal fiscal year 2025 standard terms and conditions that will accompany new grant agreements among other
provisions the grant template includes a requirement that grant recipients certify certain forms of cooperation
with federal civil immigration enforcement with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration
Officials in addition to future funding awards being at risk because most
federal grants span multiple fiscal years potential constraints on new funds could also affect dollars already
awarded at present the department has approximately 246 million in authorized but unbuild spending across all open
grants federal fiscal year 2020 through the most recent federal fiscal year 2024
which could be at risk of this 212.1 million is DHS 18.4 4 million is DOJ and
15.5 million is from other federal sources on May 13th 2025 New York State
Attorney General Leticia James joined 19 other state attorney general in a lawsuit challenging the new DHS
conditions the complaint argues that tying emergency management and disaster relief funding to state immigration
enforcement actions unlawfully exceeds the department's statutory authority
federal grant funds are essential and critical to safeguarding New York City residents and visitors as well as our
critical transportation and port infrastructure the NYPD will be closely following any news and updates regarding
this lawsuit and we will continue to work with OM to assess any potential impacts to this critical funding stream
in my 17 years working in city government I have never accepted the status quo when the status quo no longer
serves New Yorkers
has reduced crime launched a series of new strategies and plans to improve safety and quality of life and
instituted a number of reforms to improve our efficiency effectiveness and performance we are proud of this
progress but we also know that there is more work to do i am driven by that work
and committed to a strong partnership with the council we may not always agree but there will always be clear
communication and mutual respect and a shared focus on the safety and the well-being of all the people we serve
thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the extraordinary work of the men and women of the New York City
Police Department my staff and I look forward to answering your questions
thank you very much Commissioner for your testimony uh we've been joined by council members Marte Areola Powers
Brewer Wrestler Brooks Powers and Sanchez uh and Stevens i want to jump right into
um the unspent salary funding so over the course of the fiscal year uh NYPD
hasn't been staffed to its budgeted amount uh we see that there are approximately 1,300 uniform vacancies
and 1,600 civilian vacancies and we understand the department is trying to hire up to its budgeted amount and the
council is supportive of the department doing so uh we believe hiring to your full headcount could also offset some of
our overtime costs which is always a topic of interest at the council so at this time how much was budgeted for
salaries that hasn't been spent due to vacancies
so actually at this time we don't have significant personnel acrruals because the funding that had been taken tied to
uh restricting our headcount uh was restored and tied to restoring the classes that we had this year so we're
actually not anticipating significant acrruals in the current year the budget was adjusted frankly without the
headcount being taken down so it had been adjusted previously so it's pretty in line with what our staffing level so
there won't there isn't a there isn't unspent funding in the budget due to vacancies no
are you planning to selfund any new needs with with any extra money you might have we do that on the margins if
there's small amounts of money for example for OTPS or PS we will not it around but nothing significant
anticipated at this time and when do you project that you'll be able to fill all the vacant positions om has indicated
that we should be able to to get to headc count based on the funding perspective from fiscal year 27 we are
trying to do as much as we can as the commissioner said in the current calendar year we're looking to hire 3,500 officers we had a class of over
a,000 in January 769 in April are you planning more academy classes that are
over a thousand yes um we are the mayor has
been as we can find right now the goal is 35,000 by fall of next year we had
our first class in January of a thousand that was the largest class we've had in about 10 years uh our next class in
April was about 800 we're going for another thousand in July and and another
thousand thereafter at the preliminary budget hearing uh earlier this year NYPD testified that
the projected overtime spending for FY25 is going to be approximately 1.23
billion in this plan uh 301 million was added to FY25 bringing the current OT budget to
around a billion dollars so can you update us on the the endofear projection for overtime spending yes so actually
based on the overtime management plan that we've put in place and the savings we are seeing year-over-year we're now
projecting 1.1 billion for this year and and a portion of that will be grant funding
and how have some of the initiatives that you've implemented affected overtime spending and how does it how
does overtime spending currently compared to last year so the last year so essentially the
first half of fiscal year 25 as mentioned before was almost 11% higher
than in in in 2025 was 7 11% higher than in 2024 what we've seen this year since
the implementation of the overtime management plan is consistent month overmonth reductions january
year-over-year was down 9.7% february was down 10% march was
down 13.7% year-over-year and April was down 15%
so the FY26 OT budget is 578 million is
PD in talks with OM to rightsize the FY26 budget to to more accurately
reflect the actual spending yes we've been having those conversations they've been ongoing we're working with OM on
our fiscal year 26 projection and we do anticipate there will be adjustments both to reflect the need that we have on
the city funded side and also grants as they're awarded throughout the year okay the state budget included $77
million uh to New York City for overtime and enhanced patrol in the subways and
mass transit systems uh what is the plan has it been published for the public yes
so um at the NYPD uh working with the governor's office that plan funds mostly
putting two officers on every overnight train that has been running for several
months now and we are seeing very good results in terms of our uh subway safety
numbers as we sit here right now I believe uh transit crime is down 6% year
to date and could you give us an idea of how many offices are dedicated just to daily
subway patrols well for the subway safety plan for the
the overnight subway safety stuff it's upwards of 300 officers that we have
doing um the shifts on the trains and is it usually the same cops or do you rotate
it is largely the same officers doing it okay
and how does um how does overtime spending come into play here with the
enhanced uh patrol of the subways some of that is done on overtime and which
actually makes the reductions that we've seen since January since the overtime management plan all the more incredible
um because that is an area where we've had to use extra overtime and nonetheless month after month we are
seeing doubledigit declines uh departmentwide in overtime spend
um okay we heard that approximately half of NYPD's bomb squad is eligible for
retirement is that true i don't have those numbers in front of me okay it is
it is certainly quite possible um as I've said a number of times 20 years ago the city hired huge
classes of police officers and so there is an unprecedented number of people
this year eligible for retirement among the reasons that we are so focused on um
our hiring and getting as many people as possible into and through our academy
but I can look at and get back to you on the exact numbers of people in the bomb squad eligible for retirement but if
you're getting at are we going to train more people to join the bomb squad we
generally look at where people are eligible for retirement and try to plan
accordingly in terms of staffing different units in the department
okay as of March uh around $30 million has been spent on terminal leave it's
approximately 154% more than what was budgeted in FY25 could you tell us what
the reason is for that increased spending so we have seen uh as the commissioner
said there were large classes 20 years ago there were large classes in January i think there were some last year as
well so when you have more people retire there's more terminal leave payouts are more senior officers with more time
saved and and a higher salary leaving i don't have the specific distribution
but we can get back to you on that okay
um within the traffic enforcement uh unit of appropriation there's $7.7
million budgeted which supports uh $ 160 full-time positions for tow violations
as of March we see that about $130,000 has been spent for three
positions could you walk us through that tell Is this actual underspending in this area or have people been reassigned
i'll have to get back to you on the details on that specific object code and budget code okay because it looks like
there's like 157 vacant positions according to the U of A we'll look at
that there may just be a misalignment there okay uh okay one more from me and then I
have a lot of questions from colleagues the um executive capital plan includes uh 80 million about $80 million in FY25
and about 12 million in FY26 for the radio upgrades and encryption uh this represents an increase of almost $10
million in FY26 could you tell us what the status is of the radio encryption have all preins and burrows been
encrypted uh no they have not all been
encrypted yet um out of our 36 zones
63.9% 23 or 63.9% are already encrypted and we
believe that the full migration is projected to complete within one year
one last question just something um local for me the capital plan includes $9.5 million for the reconstruction of a
firing range in my district in Coney Island uh could you tell us when construction will begin and end so we
actually anticipate construction beginning this summer uh with that the contract is almost finalized and in
place uh I will before the end of the hearing get you the exact date of when we anticipate it will be complete okay
we've also been joined by Deputy Speaker Ayala i'm now going to turn it over to Chair Salam thank you very much
thank you i want to start with the 911 operators
hiring at the preliminary budget at that hearing we heard that
there was a shortage of 911 operators and that 911 calls were being directed to an audio recording we heard testimony
that a significant amount of 911 operators were on leave due to mental and physical stress this is why the
council called on the administration to provide adequate staff to answer all 911
calls in a timely manner what is the current budget and actual headcount of
911 operators the um budgeted FY26 budgeted headcount
for PCTS is 1,412 currently we sit at
1,210 which means we have 22 vacancies i am pleased to report that
we have a plan to get to our budgeted headcount within a year and this is
absolutely essential the members of our communications division our 911 um call
takers are a lifeline for New Yorkers and every call needs to be answered
without delay but that's not all the changes that we've made to our 911 call
center operations recently we changed management there we have been working
directly with the union with DC37 on ways to improve
um the quality of um the experience of
being at PCT for example we're looking at providing shuttles for our 911 call takers to the sha to the trains when
they're done with a busy shift and we have also changed who the 911 call
takers and the communications division is reporting to our first deputy
commissioner and her office are now overseeing very closely all of these
changes at 911 and it has quite serious focus from this department on addressing
the issues that you raised at the last hearing
you said that the number that you were hoping to reach or going to reach was
how much the budgeted headcount is 1,412
and you're currently at 1,210 yes 202 vacancies
202 got it would this be an appropriate number to
answer the nearly 8 million 911 calls that come in each year so I am never shy
about asking our office of management and budget in New York City or the council for new needs but I can't I
don't believe that I'm in a place now to come to you or to come to OM asking for
new needs in terms of greater authorized headcount until I get to or closer to
the authorized headcount but when we do a year from now hopefully that will be a
very different conversation well we will be having that conversation
when I the the the budgeted number for police communications is down in real numbers
from when I oversaw the communications division back when I was deputy commissioner of it and I think we have
to get back towards the 2017 numbers which was a few hundred PCTs higher than
what the current budget is
do you know how many operators are currently on leave i do not have that information in front of me but we can
get back to you right after this hearing and are 911 calls being directed to an
audio message when there are delays meaning when all
of the 911 call takers are busy answering other calls you will hear an
audio recording that basically says um just hold the phone um so yes there
are some calls that do not that where the call the caller will hear that audio
message generally at very busy times we are quite focused on reducing the
percentages of calls that go to that audio recording we need to get that back
down to zero among the reasons why we are so focused on this um hiring uh I am
proud to report that in the past month as we have been doing this real focus on
um addressing issues at the 911 call center the percentage of calls going to
that recording is is reduced do we know what the average time someone
who is in need of help is sitting on hold when it goes to the audio message i I don't have that time in front of me
but I believe that that time is going to be the average time is going to be incredibly low because the vast majority
of calls to 911 are answered
immediately and on recruitment we heard in your opening statement about some of the initiatives that you have taken to
increase NYPD's recruitment can you talk more about those initiatives and any new
ones since our hearing in March yes a few things the first thing that we did
is we looked at the elig the eligibility requirements what requirements we put on
candidates looking to become police officers and a place where we had a real glaring opportunity to improve was on
the college credits so historically at the department we have required 60
college credits to enter into the academy after a lot of thought we
reduced that number down to 24 college credits at the same time our our academy
has been accredited for more credits than previously so um people completing
the academy they they won't end if they have less than 60 college credits they won't end up with the same amount of
credits they otherwise would have had but they will end up with a significant amount of credits at the end of um their
time at the academy in addition to that we have also been working with our
fraternal organizations our NYPD associations we have many many many of
them and they know their communities the best they have been working in partnership with our personnel bureau on
um a massive recruitment effort meeting people where they are in their
communities in their schools in their houses of worship and that has been
quite successful in terms of driving up the number of uh filers or or applicants
we have to the department over the past several
months i've heard from captains in my district as I'm sure many of our colleagues have that they need
additional officers for their precincts can you talk about the staffing levels of the precincts and how officers are
assigned and deployed throughout the city yes I am very um I agree with them
we need more cops in our precincts i am also proud to tell you that as we sit
right now we have more cops on patrol today than we did a year ago and that is
because we have reassigned over a thousand officers previously working
desk jobs into precincts um and as we've
discussed at this hearing we are also looking to hire more and more as many
officers as possible because we need cops in our patrol commands you know my
approach to staffing at the NYPD is patrol transit housing
operational commands first everything else is a luxury but unless and until
those commands and those positions are fully staffed we can't see bloat in
other parts of the department and so the way we've gotten more cops onto patrol
is one by upping our hiring but two rep prioritizing those numbered commands as
we call them i want to ask about
overtime recently there was a scandal involving NYPD's former chief of department we would like to hear about
the NYPD's process for approving overtime going forward oh so in January of this year we
instituted an overtime management plan in the department where we set very
clear thresholds for uniform and civilian members of service on the
civilian side based on title and on the uniform side based on type of assignment
is it operational is it investigative or is it administrative we also have our first deputy
commissioner and our deputy commissioner of management and budget pouring over all of the overtime records to ensure
that each officer is not exceeding those overtime thresholds we
have created a new position in each command which is someone assigned an executive among their duties assigned to
ensuring compliance with the overtime rules uh and when our first deputy
commissioner or deputy commissioner of management and budget see anomalies that's who they will reach out to but
their work these their work has been extraordinary it takes an incredible
amount of doggedness and effort not just to set the standards but to make sure
that the entire department is conforming to them and I believe that we now have
the processes and procedures that are required to effectively and responsibly
manage overtime at the New York City Police Department
and I'm sorry I I found the answer to one of your previous questions the average 911 call is answered in less
than six
seconds well definitely thank you for that answer
why is 98% of the NYPD's uniform overtime budget still held in the chief of department's unit of
appropriation wouldn't budgeting overtime in other areas be an additional check on overtime spending and approvals
so the reason for that is because officers are often working overtime outside of their home command if it's a
parade if it's a protest if it's certain event so we we budget it centrally
because we honestly don't know in the beginning exactly which officer is going to be doing which overtime so the
distribution would just not be realistic across each of the uh individual uh
structures for the commands would NYPD work with OM to
budget overtime costs at the precincts and unit level at the unit level instead of holding most of the overtime funding
in one budget code so because of the challenges I just indicated that would
not enable us to manage the overtime if not it would not be reflective of how the overtime actually gets utilized
i want to move to questions about subway surfing
in recent times some of the youth in our city have been partaking in a dangerous trend of
subway surfing i would like to hear more from the commissioner on the department's
resources dedicated to educating and stopping our youth from partaking in
this dangerous activity i would also like to make sure that we aren't arresting them for this but rather we
are trying to make them understand that this is an activity that they cannot and
should not do because of the inherent dangers they're in if if it's okay chair
I'll have our chief of uh transit who oversees these efforts answer that question yes so subway surfing is one of
the main things we look at the average age of a subway surf is 14 years old which is very concerning for all of us
we had a a meeting in this room where we discussed that previously um and we take
it very seriously we take a a a couple different approaches to this one would be we have drones up um looking for
subway surfers and when we do get a subway surfer and it do stop them it's
not just an arrest it's not about arresting what we'll do with this is we will meet with the parents we will sit
down we will talk to the kids we'll identify the school we'll get our outreach to that school and speak to the
students at that school because a lot of times what we see it's repeat offenders at repeat schools so it's about outreach
at the center of everything we do with subway surfing using technology to help us do that as well and there's some
harrowing uh videos out there where you see very young individuals up on top of those trains and it's very concerning to
us but our core purpose is to identify them to identify the repeat offenders get with
their parents get with the schools and try to prevent it in the future and oftent times the parents the chief has
reported to me the parents are shocked when they see the videos of their kids
subway surfing but the parents definitely have to be a part of this equation here yeah and and to the
commissioner's point um we've had parents collapse can that were there to tell their a tragedy had happened to
their to their child who was serving so we see the effect it's it's deep rooted and uh like I said a lot of times we see
repeat offenders well definitely thank you for the effort
to stem this uh dangerous I don't even know what to call
it but it shouldn't happen right um I'm going to come back to my questioning but I'm going to
um yield to allow for Tiffany Council Member Tiffany Kaban to ask her
questions thank you uh good morning all uh I want to start with the policy that you referenced um in your testimony
about issuing criminal summones to cyclists for minor traffic infractions uh so I I just I am what I would like to
get on the record is exactly what the policy um states in more detail than
what we're seeing here uh and specifically does the policy to issue criminal summons apply to all traffic
infractions or specific ones like if there is a a I'm going to go through a couple of questions because my time is very limited um or are there specific
ones um and then in relation to that is there a similar policy for non-cyclists
so pedestrians uh motorists etc uh a and then the the second part of this question has to do um with how the
officer approaches that policy does the policy mandate that the officer is to issue a criminal summon or is the decision discretionary and if it is
discretionary I want to know what the factors are um that officers are taking into account whether to issue a criminal
summon or a or a civil summon okay so no it does not apply to all traffic
infractions there are six specific violations they are reckless driving
operating an ebike while under the influence of alcohol or drugs wrongway
riding disobeying red light signals disobeying traffic control devices and
failure to stop at a stop sign what was your second question that the policy
that that where you can issue that criminal summon is it a mandate or is the decision discretionary by the officer
officers in in any situation involving enforcement i mean officers are going to have discretion okay um so wait hold on
but to answer your question right we are giving them direction in terms of how we are looking to approach certain types of
information what are the factors cuz I'm running out of time so I just want to know list out the factors no no but that's not as as you all know that is
not how discretion works it it absolutely is it is not it is not some rigid list that's not what discretion is
at all that's factors are not Okay hold on for a second factors are not a rigid list right when a policy is
discretionary there is usually um a some sort of information around hey officers
these are the things that you should look out for um or consider when you are making the decision whether to do a
thing i'm I'm not asking for black and white hard and fast rules i'm asking you to list out what some of the factors that officers are encouraged to take
into account when they're deciding to use their discretion and and my point to you is that discretion is not the
exercise of discretion by our officers which is critical of course is not particular to C summones for certain
types of ebike infractions right when we're talking about traffic infractions generally when we're talking about
violations officers exercise discretion and and what are they thinking about when they exercise that discretion what
are the factors that they are thinking about when deciding how to to use their
discretion and it's it does not reduce to some list it is a holistic it is a holistic assessment thank you I only
have a couple seconds left so I want to finish asking questions but I think it's important to note on the record for everybody here that there's no like it
is not um it does not increase public trust in how this is being enforced if
you cannot even articulate or name the things that officers are considering when using that discretion or not and if
I could just have a couple extra seconds to to wrap up my thoughts go ahead uh on on this chair's um so I I think that
fundamentally that's an enforcement problem that is that is unacceptable i will say that the consequences of these
stops versus I I understand that there is a real challenge in creating um safe
habits but the the enforcement mechanisms and their impacts are really really disperate where a person might
get their their license suspended a person who is more likely to be a person of color who works a low-wage job who
might be an immigrant that gets a criminal summon may end up in deportation proceedings may have to go to criminal court for for months
sometimes up to a year or more um and so it's it's it's not just it's not right and
it's actually quite dangerous and the data shows that ebike collisions and injuries um through April 30th 2025 are
down 26% prior compared to the year before um rider injuries are down 17% in
that same period and pedestrian industry injuries are down 47% so I think that there are other ways to accomplish these
goals that don't involve criminalization of already vulnerable communities and outsized criminalization at that and
then I just want to uh I will end with a comment it's not a question but I I appreciated um Commissioner the the
testimony around acknowledging the long-standing racial disparities because they do exist and we can't deny them and unfortunately you had colleagues here at
the last hearing who just denied them so I I'm glad that we can at least agree on those facts it doesn't do you guys any
favors to deny that um but I will say that I was surprised by it kind of being viewed a a little bit under rosecolored
glasses here because the they haven't been substantially reduced or eliminated i I will say it's not just the stops
where the racial disparities remain but I laid out these numbers exactly in the last hearing but it's after the stop
motor vehicle stops in particular where we're seeing large racial disparities for searches after stops for arrests
after stops and for use of force after stops um with black and brown people versus white folks and so I I just think
that like we can acknowledge them but also we should acknowledge them to the scale that they exist so that we're actually doing something about it thank
you now we have uh questions from majority whip Brooks Powers
thank you chairs and hi commissioners good to see you thank you for your testimony um I'm going to start in
district issues and then span out in terms of citywide so the council and
community fought hard to secure the the creation of the 116th precinct to improve public safety and reduce
response times in Southeast Queens can the NYPD provide an update on the
staffing timeline and resource allocation for the 116th precinct will
the executive budget ensure full operation capacity for a fiscal or by
fiscal 26 also wanted to know what investments are being made in violence prevention
and intervention programs particularly for youth um how is the NYPD partnering with the cure violence groups and
community organizations to address gun violence in a holistic and preventative way rather than relying solely on
enforcement and then the last question is around um the cycling enforcement i
know that council member Kaban spoke on it but I just wanted to underscore the concern about
um cyclists being given criminal violations for infractions um
which is not what motorists get i do recognize that there is a need um a
substantiated need to have greater enforcement because there is a degree of
what the public feels has felt like lawlessness in terms of cycling behavior
but I don't know that giving criminal citations is the
way to go and so I wanted to understand better the police department's rationale for issuing criminal summones to
cyclists for minor infractions like running a red light when the same infraction is treated as a civil penalty
um for pedestrians and drivers so let me start uh with the new 116 precinct um
current personnel assigned there 199 people uh two captains uh seven
lieutenants 20 sergeants 147 police officers and
detectives and 23 civilians we have seen
great results I would say in terms of the decrease in response times since
that command opened up so um if we look at precinct average response times for
all calls pre and post for the 105 precinct pre the 116 opening the average
time was 21 minutes and 3 seconds post the average response time is 8 minutes
and 38 seconds if we look at the 113 same idea pre 20 minutes and 48 seconds
post 16 minutes and 19 seconds so we are pleased with the the what we are seeing
in terms of the trends in response times um I'll do ebikes quickly and then I'll
call someone up to um talk about cure violence and the work we do partnering
there uh I said in my testimony that I am eager to work with this council on a
legal framework new enforcement paradigm for ebikes in New York City in fact I
call on this council to change the laws as they relate to ebikes in this city um
but under the current law we had two options one was issuing B
summones and the other was issuing C summones as it relates relates to ebike
enforcement the B summones were virtually meaningless
b summones work for cars for vehicles where licenses are required because if
you have multiple infractions or you don't show up you know to court or you
don't pay your summons there are real consequences you either get points on your license or your license is
suspended so the B summons paradigm exists for licensed
drivers because ebikes aren't licensed b summones don't work they're meaningless
so the only option that we had under the current law as it exists was to issue C
summones i look forward to working with this
council to address this issue headon i do believe that the enforcement
framework has to change we can look at licensing we can look at other things but the current state of affairs doesn't
work for anyone it doesn't work for the cyclists and it certainly doesn't work
for pedestrians i want to be extremely clear this is not a war on ebikes or
bikers this is in response to very real concerns that are widely held across
virtually every burrow and every neighborhood in this city where we're hearing people tell us that they are
afraid to cross the street where we see a terrible video in Williamsburg from
this weekend of a young child being blasted by an ebike barreling down the
street the old paradigm of issuing B summones and having virtually no enforcement didn't work i believe that
the C summons is the best option that we have now and we are seeing people on
ebikes pay more attention to the rules of the road as we have begun this
enforcement push i also want to put in context that of something like we've
given out 250,000 plus B summones or tickets to
drivers this year so far this year the number to bikers is several thousand so
it is definitely I mean we we need to keep the scale of the different types of
enforcement in mind as we talk about this and I appreciate the perspective and um as you may know we have a bill um
right now in my committee that looks to create a task force to address um the
the the need for greater regulation and to to take into account this relatively
new mode of um transportation and I welcome any feedback and suggestions
that um the department may have to contribute to that but thank you for that and chairs if I could just ask one
final question if that's um so our our districts particularly in southeast Queens and I'm sure this is happening
citywide quite honestly are being inundated with commercial vehicles parking um being parked illegally
overnight with many repeat offenders um law enforcement has the ability to issue
the maximum penalty when issuing tickets to stop the behavior can we understand
how come that's not happening do we have transportation here
or do you do you want to take that chief i was going to take cure oh let him do cure violence sorry we skipped that and
then we'll answer your transportation question thank you for Go ahead yes u Chief Michael Petri the chief of crime control strategies so approximately a
year ago the ceasefire program the NYPD ceasefire program was moved into crime
control strategies and as you know ceasefire and cure work hand in hand so
my office working with the mayor's office of criminal justice share data with cure you know we we give them data
as far as uh shots fired uh incidents shooting incidents we also provide them
with intelligence so we when we get intelligence of a possible retaliatory
shooting involving uh crews in New York City we reach out to to Cure and we give them this information so it is a very
good relationship i've I've worked personally and my office has worked personally with CUR from the inception
and we will continue to do that thank you you're welcome
good morning CM good morning could you just repeat the question about Sure
thank you for that um so I was focusing on the inundation of commercial vehicles
parking illegally overnight and oftent times there's a lot of repeat offenders
and so law enforcement has the ability to issue the maximum penalty when issuing tickets but we haven't seen that
happening so we wanted to understand why that doesn't happen okay so one of the
things we started to do is uh work very closely in some of the districts of some of the council members here so we'll
reach out and we'll certainly visit um you and your staff just to see what the problem is and we'll be able to tow i
think that's actually better than even issuing summones so we'll do that work for you that would be great excellent i would just add that year to date as of
April 30th truck and trailer overnight parking summones increased by over 42%
this is an area that we are definitely focused on it also overlaps with the work that we're doing with our new
quality of life division so maybe we can all sit down and discuss how we can
directly address the issues that you are seeing in your district i know you're always very clear about what they are
thank you okay we've also been joined by council members Joseph and Hudson and now I'm going to give it back to Chair
Salam thank you i just want to maybe add to the last
part of the the challenge with
ebikes cuz I I'm not [Music]
um I mean the reality is that is there's a there's a problem that needs to be fixed i myself was hit by a bike you
know walking across the 72nd Street uh area and pushed my children out of the
way so that they weren't injured um wasn't a um a delivery ebike
it was just a person on a city bike that might have just been enjoying the day but completely
oblivious that the light now was red and they kept going um so I'm worried about the policy
specifically the policy of criminalizing people for something that really should be a civil matter um especially as it
relates to delivery workers because that that education piece has to be
translated into their understanding of why we need more safety you
know I want to go into the quality of life their teams and the criminal
summones for the ebikes a little bit more and want to discuss the um quality
quality of life division and teams that you recently announced i know they are only being
placed in certain precincts how will you evaluate the effectiveness of these teams for expansion so we are doing a
pilot now in six precincts and we tried to pick precincts where we saw different
crime levels different types of uh quality of life issues um with the
intent of learning from that pilot in those six precincts and then
expeditiously rolling the program out citywide so the intent of this program
is to go citywide and uh a few months into the pilot now as I sit here I
believe that we will be able uh to take this citywide expeditiously and I look
forward to uh announcing soon a schedule for that
and what's the biggest quality of life issue you will be targeting with these teams i mean we've seen the new policy
that criminal sentences will now be issued for traffic offenses and and so forth and so on ebikes um is there an
issue these teams will be specifically focusing on so it will change uh it will
vary precinct to precinct depending on what what the big quality of life
concerns are but I will tell you just citywide illegal parking is certainly the largest
311 complaint we get now over half a million uh 311 complaints about illegal
parking the second highest is residential noise at over 300,000 blocked
driveways 170,000 noise on the street or sidewalk 161,000 abandoned vehicles 70,000 those
types of things that like some are some categories are up or down depending on on what precinct you're at but the very
basic things that people complain to 311 about since 2016 the number of calls to
311 that the NYPD is responsible um to respond to have doubled or have nearly
doubled and so people are clearly like literally calling out for help and the
quality of life teams are designed to address that or be responsive to that
gotcha want to move to stun guns so I want to talk about the NYPD's
use of non-lethal equipment what non-lethal equipment does an officer
have at their disposal when engaging with an individual currently
um for that I am going to ask our chief of training to come up to respond to the
question
more me oh
do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth before the council members of this committee i do you may begin hi sir from our team at Arasa
chief of training so we both equipped with the OC spray otherwise known as MACE as well as the Taser we don't call
it the stun gun there's two models right now we have the Taser 7 that we're
transitioning to coming off from the
X26 x26 do we know what the the life cycles
for this equipment is and is there funding to replace the equipment i know that you said that they're moving from
the X26 to the Taser 7 yes so uh the life cycle is five years for the tasers
and we actually lease the tasers and we pay about $11 million a year for that
and so that means when it comes past five years you get it just a new one at
the same price exactly we're able to replace it is there is the in terms of the life cycle and this is just me maybe
pardon my ignorance if say for instance a taser
is was manufactured say this year and I know we're moving to the X20 to the to
the from the X26 to the taser 7 if in that fiveyear cycle that
particular taser was not used would that taser be like kind of trashed
for lack of a better word i don't I could get back to you on that but I don't believe that we have them uh in a way that we're not using them that they
would expand you know expunge on their life cycle but I I'll just I'll just um
try to make this clear when you lease equipment rather than buy it at city
agencies often that is done to flatten the cost and also to ensure that you
don't run into problems with equipment being past end of life so presumably as
part of that contract once a taser goes beyond year five then the company is
required to provide a new taser to the department so you don't have end of life
equipment is that correct yes okay
what can what can diminish the effectiveness of non-lethal equipment
one could increase the effectiveness of diminish diminish the effectiveness of non-lethal equipment so one thing that
we're taking a good hard look on at in this department right now under the leadership of the first deputy
commissioner and the the chief of training is um the effectiveness of our
tasers i have seen too many videos um body camera clips that end in use of
lethal force um where the officers for first attempted non-lethal force and so
we are pouring through our data looking how we track it and preparing to have um
some conversations with Axon the the company that provides the taser to us to
look at perhaps we should go to beyond the X7 to the newest model if we're
seeing if we're having concerns about um having to use lethal force when we first
tried non-lethal
i want to end with regards to the Argus cameras the executive capital plan
includes approximately $3 million in fiscal year 25 for Argus cameras what is
the cost per box and just as a followup where are you prioritizing placement of the Argus
cameras and the use of this and Argus cameras and the use of this
funding and what precincts are you looking at so the cost per box is about $45,000 per box and each box has two
cameras so you're getting two cameras for $45,000 essentially in terms of uh where
the cameras go our crime prevention division recommends appropriate locations based on data and information
they have and uh crime statistical data and then our strategic technology division works with the DOT to conduct
surveys of those locations to ensure the exact appropriate location for the boxes and the cameras and one thing I am very
pleased about is I understand that some of this work putting up Argus boxes had been delayed for quite some time among
the reasons was an expired contract or lack of an active contract i'm very
pleased to report that we now have uh an active long-term contract to continue to
or to resume our efforts to put up Argus cameras in New York City and I am
looking forward to getting many more boxes up on the streets this year than
we did last year i have the list of precincts where they are going up that I
could either provide you or I could read to you now it's going the the 45 the 62
Central Park 6147 50 Manhattan North 103
10768 122nd 7276 106 404142 109
111149 and those precincts are generally done by which council member gave us
funding to put up boxes where in those districts they go we usually have our
crime team um look at where we're seeing the most violence in those commands
thank you thank you thank you chair okay now we have questions from Council
Member Williams hello i have so many questions so I'll
And they're like all over the place like I had prepared questions and now I have more questions so I'll try to get through them um apologies in advance
chair um so I guess I'll start with traffic enforcement um it is projected to have 10.5 million
in OTPS um I have a lot of questions about
uh costs of trucks and other um equipment that allow the officers in the
precincts to properly um tow trucks so can you share like how much of that goes
to like the lots the trucks and how much a truck costs so the the trucks are actually in our
capital budget so that wouldn't be part of the OTPS that you're seeing there so what is that money for then that money
is for equipment um it anything is it for the window things that you guys are
using now the like the boots yes yes that would be that would be the
barnacles right yes that would be uh covered with OTPS and how do you determine like how to disperse those
assets so when when it comes to anything tied to to the budget and particularly
non-personnel costs the division or the um deputy commissioner of management budget my team and I work with the
individual bureaus uh and commands on what their operational needs are what equipment do they need what what
additional staffing enhancements overtime and we have that ongoing dialogue if there's a new initiative for example for the barnacle hey we want a
better way to do this or a different way to do it we would sit down with the commands look at it my contracts team
would look and say okay what is the estimated cost for this sort of thing and then we would go through if we determined to move forward a contracting
process and are you able to just send my office um scopes for the barnacles the
boots and tow trucks because we had tried to get quotes from the police department about how much it costs yeah
we can give you information on what those pieces and I want to just give a quick shout out to I believe he's a
sergeant Sergeant De Jesus at the 113 he works very hard in that division um and
oftentimes with very limited resources so my thing is always trying to get them more resources so they can do more um
thank you for that you're welcome okay so the other question I have is about the crime lab um the crime lab is in my
district and I know you just visited commissioner i did um and they have a
lot of opinions because we're also doing a neighborhood plan there so they're part of my advisory committee uh roof
leaks heating ventilation issues i actually have a friend who was out of work um because she got exposure to
heroin and she used all the proper materials but the ventilation um within
the crime lab is just not good at all um they don't have enough space to work um
I have heard reports of evidence being lost and so the police officers are going out and doing all this good police
work and then if you're not able to like properly assess what they're bringing in
to them these for these cases to be prosecuted it kind of defeats the purpose so just wondering if there are
any plans to get a new crime lab renovate the existing crime lab yeah I
was um actually as you mentioned I was there last week to discuss with them or
to start the discussion with them on just that topic i think it's very clear
to me and to others in the department that the current crime lab is not a
crime lab that is built for the future and I believe we need to start the
capital process of assessing or figuring out what the the go forward plan is for
a new crime lab i don't believe that anyone thinks that it would make sense to renovate the
existing building um but we are getting that together now i know that in the detective bureau they've done a huge
amount of work over the past several years to begin some of this analysis and I am looking forward to hopefully moving
this from an idea into a budgeted because I heard reports of like um not
able to have upgraded computer systems that allow them them to do their work efficiently um I also well the computer
the the upgrades to computer systems that should be happening and I will talk to the IT teams if that is not happening
certainly it's required for their accreditation which is coming up but I
am looking forward to working with the mayor's office and the office of management and budget to making and
making it one of my capital priorities to push ahead on a crime lab of the
future for New York City okay and one more thing um still in the crime lab is
uh also that they don't have money in their budget for the contracts they maintain the equipment so apparently
there's a ton of equipment not being used because they don't have money to contract someone to service the
equipment so it's odd because that didn't come up when I spent a few hours uh there last week but it is certainly
something that our deputy commissioner of management and budget will follow up with our chief of detectives on okay can
I just ask a few more questions thank you so much um can I this is just you can give me this later but if I can get
a racial and gender breakdown of the recent discretionary promotions and upcoming ones that would be great
um one of the chiefs uh testified about sharing intel with cure are you talking
about the CMS groups yes themselves um okay dc testified last week they didn't
mention that because we asked about the relationship with CMS and NYPD they did share the only thing they said was about
the roll call and so I just wanted to know if you have any data on the frequency of how many times a CMS group
attends roll call i don't really think that's an effective way to really develop a relationship even though I've attended roll calls I feel like the
relationship needs to be a little bit more than saying hello to the officers that are about to go in the streets i
can't answer the roll call question but I could tell you that my office uh usually has a call with Cure Violence
CMS on a weekly basis and we share data on a weekly basis also okay
um I'll just hurry up with my last questions um I'm excited about the Q teams i would love to know when they
will be rolled out in the 103rd 105th 113th and 116th precinct because quality of life is probably number one in
Southeast Queens and I know the um commanding officers that we have had a
lot of them have grown up in the community and they take great pride in reallocating resources to address
quality of life but we're really excited about the Q teams and so just wanted to know when it when you plan to roll it out in Southeast Queens i will have
those dates uh soon okay in lastish for
right now um is I know you testified that you look forward to working with us on youth strategies and in a previous
hearing um there was some testimony on like the youth officers and I love community affairs I will say that all
the time I don't think their budget is enough and I think between the community affairs officers and the youth officers
like these are the officers that we want to see do this proactive and not reactive police work and I just don't
think that their budgets align with the department's this priority of like trying to help our young people uh do
better i understand the feedback and I will say we we can get you the exact
numbers but I will say that the community affairs bureau is perhaps the
only bureau in the department whose staffing numbers are significantly
higher today than they were in 2018 when we
had 11% more officers um so I am also
sensitive to staffing in community affairs understand the feedback but I
wanted to make sure that it was put in that context and that perspective yeah i'm more so looking for more resources
in their OTPS budget understood yeah like we have them great but then oftent
times they're not able to actually do the things that would be wonderful in the community because they don't have any money to do it understood thank you
okay we have questions from Ayala followed by Holden thank you um I had a question regarding
the 911 uh response time i just needed some clarity so you mentioned that uh
the response times are usually around 6 minutes I believe oh I'm I'm so sorry the question was how what's the average
time in which a 911 caller's call is first answered and it is under six
seconds under six seconds okay is that all of the time because it's kind of contrary to what we've been hearing the
average excuse me that is the average and I um said that because the vast
majority of 911 calls are answered immediately but over the past year and
this was raised at the last hearing we've seen an unacceptable rise in the
number of 911 calls that first get that go to a recording yes under the
leadership of the first deputy commissioner we are taking a real good
hard look and turning over lots of stones at the communications division
and that plan in and with with the purpose of driving down the number of
calls that first go to that recording um we are looking at our staffing levels
making an aggressive plan to hire to budgeted headcount over the next year in
the PCT title we've done management changes there we're looking at changes in procedures and we are also working
very closely on all of this with DC37 who's really rolled up their sleeves
under Henry's leadership and been a very good partnership and helping us begin to
address the issues that this council so able called out yeah no I really appreciate that because I this is kind
of you know new territory for us i hadn't ever heard of a situation where
you know um the wait times had been as long as they were so I really appreciate Me neither and I in um my previous role
at the NYPD I oversaw the 9 the communications division which is the
includes the 911 call takers and so when this issue was first brought to my attention I too was shocked yeah yeah no
it was pretty bad um regarding the uh the change in policy um from C2B bike
um violations for ebike um riders you mentioned that you would welcome a change in the law um and better uh I
guess interactions with the council but I I I'm curious had there been any conversations prior to the change in
policy i'm so sorry I didn't mean better interactions with the council i have always worked very well with the council
um my my point was that the current framework for regulating the use of the
safe use of ebikes doesn't make sense it doesn't work and we've had the
proliferation of ebikes in New York City without an accompanying change in the
regulatory framework for it yeah and so I believe that something has to change
in the law and I am interested in working directly with the council with
the department of transportation to chart the future for
creating the new to chart the future for ebikes in New York City yes i mean I think you know I myself have almost been
run down by an e you know a biker i would say it's a biker because it wasn't an ebike but um you know on a bike lane
ironically enough so I get it i you know I I believe that there needs to be you know some level of accountability i
think you know the concern that you're hearing from the body today um and have been hearing probably you know via
social media and you know every other form of communications that we have is that we have a very different
administration that is um spending a lot of resources uh deporting individuals
that you know are not even on the list of you know dangerous uh individuals and
um we don't want to further complicate matters by um
criminalizing folks that would be more susceptible to that type of behavior if
if you if that's understood however I am open to having a conversation with the NYPD about exploring ways that make
sense to clarify what those consequences should be um I just I'm not aware of any
conversations happening before the change in the policy have there been just I'm just looking for clarity on
that um so I think that you know I'm new to the department but my sense is the
department and frankly New Yorkers have felt for a long time that the current in
that the enforcement use the use of B summones as the enforcement paradigm was
virtually futile that our officers were out there writing tickets and that it
wasn't causing or creating any changes of behavior to the contrary because
people on ebikes generally felt like they lived in a consequencefree environment we were all
seeing widespread mass flouting of the very basic rules that we have in New
York City around transportation safety and so under the current law the only
other option was to write C summones which we are doing now in greater
numbers than we had previously but just again to put this in context it is
several thousand uh um summones for ebikes this year
compared to over 250,000 summones for cars and that
doesn't include the red light cameras and all that other stuff just that the NYPD has has given out but yes I think
we agree i look forward to working with the council to come up with a framework
for uh safe ebike or bicycle use in New York City that meets the current
magnitude of the problem okay and we we welcome that i think we all agree right we want safer streets and we want you
know even bikers right to uh feel free and safe on on the road and so um we
welcome that i just wanted to clarify because I wasn't aware of any conversations that had occurred prior um
to today regarding any legislative fixes to this problem um and finally I have
two more questions regarding the um purchasing of vehicles is there how much
money is is set aside in the budget to purchase new um vehicles for the local precincts i'm sorry if I missed it i was
late so in the current budget we have is it $21 million i'm doing this off the
top of my head yeah so um in in the in the current fiscal year uh we have uh
$21 million and then next year uh what we need uh is close to to 70 million and
OM has graciously indicating they're allowing us to go forward with orders so that we can acquire a,000 new vehicles
in 26 so that's great i mean that is huge for this department a thousand new
vehicles injected into our fleet will allow us to replace a large number of uh
vehicles that are either at or nearing end of life and they will be very
welcome in the commands yes they will i know they bring it up all the time um and regarding the Argus cameras I did I
I know that I specifically um put in some funding for East Harlem and the South Bronx i heard you mention the 40 i
didn't hear you mention the 25 um and it was the funding was earmarked specifically for those two i'm sorry i
have the two five I just do you know how many cameras will be installed in each for each uh I can get you the Hold on
let me see if I have it right here um one second i can get it I can get it back to
you i will get it to you the breakdown by precinct i really appreciate that in your district thank you okay okay
okay we have questions from Council Member Holden followed by Lewis so thank you Commissioner for mentioning
ebikes because um we're at a you know a crossroads in the city um ebikes or
e-mobility vehicles and it's interesting I have co- I have 28 co-sponsors on my
bill to license ebikes which I introduced a while ago 28 that's the
majority of the city council the the people that the the council members that brought up your C summons um issue are
not on the bill and maybe they should get on if they want to really address
this but um and even uh a few have been hit by ebikes they they got on the
original bill and they dropped off um for unknown reasons so if we're in a
public health crisis and your the bums doesn't make any sense um or as you said
then what's the solution and if if if licensing ebikes brings accountability
and a change in behavior it makes a lot of sense but yet we're hearing the
opposite to today but let me just get into um important issues um and I want
to bring up response time because it's been a it's been a big issue and we had
it come uh I hear this almost every week of nightmare stories two weeks ago two
men were riding the wrong way they they were in a vehicle in a car riding the wrong way and hit some
vehicles um residents came out cars were hit they of course these guys were
intoxicated both of them one the driver was definitely intoxicated uh 911 was called one over
one hour the residents held these two individuals over one hour we couldn't
get a a squad car there and um so I want to bring up the the critical response
times what's what's the critical response what's the procedure commissioner on backlog because I don't
hear that anymore i don't hear going into alert where we can get help from a neighboring precinct um I don't hear
central getting on uh and saying and calling the um the people and saying you
know we're we're coming or this will this will uh uh work you know we'll work it out go ahead i'm sorry so which is
exactly why we have made a number of changes over the past month in how the
911 call center is managed including but not limited to having the communications
division report up to the first deputy commissioner's office where her
commanding officer who is sitting in that seat right there used to work for me when the 911 call center was at its
very best running communications and he is now
overseeing the work to address many of the issues that you raised around um 911
and communications but just before I let him speak to give you some numbers that
you requested um crime uh critical crimes in
progress the average response time now citywide is 7 minutes for FY25 7 minutes
and 10 seconds that is down 8 seconds from FY 24
um Chief Npalitano do you have anything to add yes good afternoon Councilman
response time for the NYPD is actually down 9.5% this year for crimes in
progress 9 minutes and 34 seconds last year to 840 this year so we're actually
doing very well on that as far as backlogs backlogs are down 15% this year
15 15% that's correct it's 2,695 last year to 3,00 I'm sorry
3,167 last year to 2,695 this year so we're down
substantially in that as well and do you go into alert um like how do I get how
do I get a a neighboring precinct to chip in and help out when guys are
sitting there for an hour holding these two individuals and this this I can tell you nightmare story after nightmare
story this is going on and we're not solving it i think we need to look at that job and see how and see how it was
coded perhaps there was an error in the coding of it which the chief will address do you have anything else to add
there yes at the break if you'd like to share that with me we'll do a detailed
analysis oh I have a lot not only that story but I have a lot of them and it's it's reoccurring commissioner this is
not going away and we need a some better fail safe because central's deciding
priority isn't aren't they they're who's who decides priority it's actually
decided what the priorities are it's it's calculated and it's it's decided and it's trained to the dispatchers and
just to explain the question you asked earlier if there's a problem in another
command the dispatchers are trained to pull from another command when necessary so if you're in the 104 and uh there's
nobody available but if there's a male shot they will pull from an adjoined yeah but I I asked that question um
Chief and I asked the question Commissioner um I I'll talk to the precinct why didn't you go Why didn't we
get the 112 why didn't we get the 108 to come in why just leave it for over an
hour of two people uh being held by by civilians and I I want to just be very
clear that we agree with you that is not acceptable which is why we want to do a
deep dive to see how it was coded my guess is that it was coded as a vehicle
collision property damage only which is of a lower priority and would get a
longer response time thank you but we will look at it and I think the first deputy commissioner has something to add
sorry also we want to add that uh we added supervisor response time
supervisors to each platoon on communic in communications so over the last month
we're seeing that once we are in alert that those supervisors will make sure that they're talking to the PCTs the
burrows if need be but we'll look into the matter of the job that you brought up thank you all thanks thank you now we
have questions from Council Member Lewis followed by Areola thank you chairs and good morning
commissioner to you and your team um I have four quick questions i'll try to barrel them out and if I get if I'm
granted more time I'll reiterate them uh with the with the increase in school
safety division reflected in FY26 executive budget can NYPD clarify
whether this funding will address long-standing shortages of crossing guards and hightra school zones and
whether new metrics or prioritization tools will be used to guide deployment
and underserved schools school areas and safety uh with with high levels of uh
safety incidents 22 my next one is on uh DV in FY26 there will be an expansion of
team will there be expansion of teams such as Can we do one at a time i promise I'll answer all of them but I'm
going to forget all I'm limited on time but the school safety if you want to start with that okay do you want to give
them give her the numbers school crossing guards yes so um actually I'm just need a second for that for the for
the full-time school crossing guards uh we are we're basically at headcount let me get you the part time if you want to
move on to the to the next question it'll be good to know FY26 what that would look like um for FY26 will there
be an expansion of teams such as victim advocates or domestic violence officers within the individual NYPD precinct
what's the plan uh for how these resources will be equitably allocated
across the city um and with the reduction of the burl squads within the detective division and f in the FY26
plan to what extent will this impact detectives and teams working on outstanding missing person cases and
what are those mitigations looking like so that's regarding that and I could just do the last one really quick um
officers and multiple precincts um have raised concerns about being reassigned
to transit district command often abruptly what is the justification for these reassignments um and are they
primarily due to budgetary constraints or staffing gaps in transit and how are
these reassignments uh impacting local precinct level operations and morale particularly in neighborhoods already
experiencing uh shortages so for many of these issues all touch on
the same thing which is the overall uniform staffing at the NYPD which we
know is down over 10% over the past four years or uh no four or five years um for
the transit uh deployments yes we have pulled cops from other commands to work
in transit um the most recent surge in resources to
transit we aimed to correct some mistakes of the past where we are now pulling
largely from our field training teams meaning officers newly out of the
academy as well as officers previously working administrative assignments in
nonoperational commands and the idea there was to put less strain less pull
on the resources of numbered commands the same priority that we've placed on
numbered commands be they in transit housing patrol in terms of of staffing
we are also doing that with our numbered squads uh for detectives so that has
meant from time to time pulling detectives out of niche or specialty
units and putting them instead into numbered squads it's a numbered command
first approach to uniform staffing at the police department which is exactly
what the police department and the city of New York need now especially given
the uniform staffing numbers that we're seeing will they return back to their commands where they were before i think
that's some of the questions a lot of them have it depends in some circumstances yes and in some
circumstances these are temporary assignments many of the transit deployments that we have done recently
are temporary assignments and the officers should know that um but we will
be very happy to clarify that to them if you are suggesting that it is not known
some of them feel but in terms of the so we will for sure take that feedback and
make sure that that is extremely clear but for the transfers of officers from
um more specialized or niche or centralized
um detective bureau units into squads that those transfers are not temporary
those transfers are permanent transfers because we um need to address the those
um those cases first got it and on the
uh school crossing guards just uh as of last week we had 2,251 school crossing guards that
includes 2,74 level ones those are the part-time school crossing guards and 77 level twos
uh that's uh a vacancy rate of vacancies 45 vacancies on the on the part-time and
12 on the full-time and before the new school year where the personnel bureau uh looks at the school crossing guards
and their schedule hiring in August with the goal of filling those vacations this is August for FY 26 you have a schedule
recruitment this August for this August for the school the upcoming school year yes thank you Commissioner thank you
chairs okay questions from council member Areola followed by Brewer
thank you chairs and thank you commissioner and your entire team for coming out today i want to just touch on
a couple of points that you made that were causing an increase in crime in certain areas and in where you asked for
collaborative help from this council um with respect to
uh criminals who are wearing masks and committing crimes I've introduced Intro 10:15 which would amend the
administrative code of the city of New York to prohibiting ski masks to be worn in public spaces and other sensitive
areas with the exclusion but not limited to uh health and religious uh reasons i
also have a bill that is pending to make ATVs banned from our streets atvs are
off- street vehicles we do not have off-road areas in the five burrows where
they could be utilized we spoke about ebikes many of the members are are
concerns i'm happy to be a part co-sponsor on on um council member
Holden's ebike registration bill our purview with the city council we can
only ask DOT to register the the ebikes but I'm also very supportive of Assembly
Member Rajkumar's bill to have the dis the DMV register license and um ebikes
so this way they can be given a lesser summon when stopped and not and and
would be reduced from a criminal summon additionally we talked about staffing so I have a bill that's that's being worked
on right now it's pending to do a $10,000 sign on and stay on bonus for
our officers we have to incentivize them to come to us and we have to incentivize
us because they've been so disincentivized to come to become police officers and finally the crimes of
urination and public drug abuse have a a bill that's pending being written that
would make them more punishable the fines would be more punishable so that is the way I wanted you to know that
that we are working in collaboration with you especially uh my colleagues and myself and many of those bills I have
bipartisan support but my question is our precincts right now are severely
lacking vehicles in their fleet so I just wondered if there was a plan that you have that you want to set forth that
would enhance the fleet in our local precincts so first council member thank
you so much for your efforts and your partnership on those and so many other
issues of concern to New Yorkers um as for the vehicles it is a piece of
feedback that we are getting from our cops all the time basically citywide that their that their vehicles are
beaten up um and in fact many of them are either at end of life or past end of
life which is why I'm thrilled to report that um the office of management and
budget has greenlighted our purchase of a thousand new vehicles we are placing
or have placed many of the orders already and we expect those vehicles to
trickle in over the next six months and that will definitely be very well
received at commands um across the five bureaus thank you so much that that's
incredible news and I just want to close with thanking you for your collaborative approach changes that you've made in
policies in staffing the compliance stat the fact that your your quality life
division is really making a difference and it has already had a positive effect on crime you know statistics and also
within the NYPD and really you are a steady hand uh in leadership for the
NYPD thank you for what you're doing okay questions from Council Member Brewer followed by Wrestler i've always
liked Kelly and Bratton but you have kicked their ass in terms of your information today and I will tell
them um my question starting with paperwork I think that you are working
on some kind of a um project that would hopefully have a more streamlined
paperwork now don't blame the city council because it's not all our fault but sometimes half of the tour is
filling out paperwork so what are we going to do about that michael Gerber knows all about this
go ahead Michael yeah sure so so um we are working on that and it's a discussion we've had before obviously and I'll just give one good example it's
a small piece but it's in in in the vein of what you're talking about so for example um we now have as you know level
one and level two reporting that we do we had um you know we we realized the cops were doing for level two there's a
consent to search form they had two separate forms right one one the level two form one the consent to search form
um which kicks in at level two so we did what I'm sure you would say is painfully obvious which is we combined the forms
uh and so so now instead of doing having to do two forms in that situation they're doing one so we're looking for
opportunities to do exactly that we want fewer forms uh in a perfect world in a
perfect world there would just be one form that an officer would fill out and it would autopop populate to lots of
other things um I just want to I just I just add here because this is all a lot
of detail like big picture our officers are required to fill out way too much
paperwork and way too many forms and I would welcome the opportunity to work
with this council okay on a massive bill to
modernize what types of forms and what types of reporting the New York City
Police Department and specifically our police officers are required to do because some of this stuff came about
like 10 20 years ago and in my opinion is no longer relevant or necessary
or something that we want our officers like burning their time on it's it's
truly wasteful we agree since they spend half their time when I go out and I see that so let's work on that number two
where's the Manhattan towound so I I've been working on it no I would
I would love to be I've been out looking sitting here saying something other than that unfortunately you the circumstances are
still the same it is very very challenging to find affordable real estate in Manhatt what we are so we are
working in conjunction with Dcast with CBRE which is the the real estate firm that contracts with Dcast what we're
also focusing on they're not the best firm as we remember what what we're focusing on now is really looking at
space that other agencies may have that they are not fully utilizing or maybe have a hold on and something they're not
going to use for a decade any time frame on that so I'm I'm hoping within the
next few months we'll have this solidified if not sooner okay um the issue of the uh ghost plates so you I
want to know how you are updating on resources dedicated to the program and then is there any enforcement that you
can see that's making a difference on ghost plates we do a tremendous amount of enforcement on our ghost cars i'm
just going to pull up the numbers do you know Peter okay
in some neighborhoods it's a lot of ghost plates and there's some lady okay sell selling Virginia plates out of the
back of her car too and you can order them from Amazon
ghost plates year to date
over 34 wait oh
okay year to date over 11,000 B summones over a thousand
seizures okay um All right i mean I assume that makes a difference who knows i mean
there's many more but it's a start right point is we have real resources
dedicated to enforcing the rules around um ghost plates and license plates and
we run operations all the time um another car about cars i don't know what
Crayo cars are but I think they're the rental unmarked cars that were being tracked so you're doing new tracking
procedures i think they're expensive and so I was just wondering to get an update on that well when I uh started at the
department one of the things that we looked at was how we were using and
allocating a class of vehicle called Crayo vehicles which are supposed to be
they're unmarked cars and they're generally supposed to be used for investigative and undercover work and so
we've done um based on that analysis a reallocation of Crayo vehicles to make
sure that they are being assigned to commands where um they are
doing undercover and investigative work and so it's not a million dollars a month or something it's less now oh the
cost for KO yes so it's it's it's not a million we we are projecting uh about 9
to 10 million this year in expenses so it it is a significant expenditure and that's part of why we're looking at
making sure these are used when and how they should be okay but they are a a
meaningful and important part of our overall fleet okay um in terms of um
NICHA I'm a big believer in PSAs but the NICHA residents as you know desperately
need vertical vertical verticals and I just want to know what is there going to be an increased focus on the NICHA
residents they love NYPD they the doors are never going to close i don't care what you do at NICA those doors are
never going to close and so people go in and out you know the issues but there's just not enough PSA folks there so Chief
Makavoy is our new chief of housing and he will answer that question thank you hi good afternoon so um we still do
verticals or as we also call them interiors uh roughly in all the housing developments and roughly we average as
not just from the housing bureau but all the other partners patrol services bureau roughly 70,000 a year okay i mean
I got that i just I have complaints all day long i probably know as much as anybody about NICHA so it it has to be
increased i don't know how to do it the homeless are sleeping there your your friends come they smoke weed in the
hallways they scare the living daylights particularly out of the seniors yeah it is part of the house you got to have more verticals or interiors it's part of
our strategy to uh reduce crime and improve the quality of going to have more verticals or interiors this year
definitely how many more can't wait hold on council member we um I have every confidence that the
chief is going to ensure we have more verticals this year but the real answer to this is addressing the uniform
staffing shortfalls that we have even though I have prioritized in terms of
officer allocation the numbered commands and the numbered squads many of them
most of them are still down real numbers compared to five six years ago and so
hopefully the mayor's plan to get us back up to a staffing of 35,000 officers
that will make the big difference how many verticals were doing no I agree i just want you to focus on NICHA that's
all I'm saying because when I go to Rikers I know all the inmates detaineees
hi Gail hi Gail hi Gail because I know NICHA and so they need help nicha needs
help that's what I'm trying to say um in terms of um CRT how um is the
effectiveness of overtime judge for units like CRT and the new Q teams how
do you you know decide this is effective so um for CRT that is an operational
command and and the way we've we've managed overtime in the department on the uniform side is we have set
thresholds for uniforms based on the type of work they do operational
administrative or investigative crt would be operational which means they
may do 40 hours of overtime each month and the first deputy
commissioner and the deputy commissioner of management and budget um oversee the whole thing and make sure no one exceeds
it in terms of how it whether or how we're assessing whether they are using
their overtime effectively or not do we have someone from the chief of department's office bruce can you come
up thanks oh maybe chief of patrol sorry whatever
sorry could you just repeat that question sure the question is with CRT or quality of life how do you determine the effectiveness based on overtime and
then Chief Rivera I apologize that's okay that's all right thank you both very much you did a great job
Bruce they all do a great job we just got a lot of problems so with respect to
CRT uh you know their mission is primarily uh focused on vehicle uh
introdiction uh mopeds uh our uh car meets that that sort of stuff so um
we're looking at um they stick to their 40 hours if there's special assignments
beyond that then you know we'll allocate them specifically but they're get capped at 64 and the same idea with quality of
life the new division yeah quality of life most of those um cops work actually
in commands and numbered commands and precincts as part of Q teams and so they
would be subject to the same overtime threshold i don't want to I know the issue of ebikes has been discussed a lot
my issue is the folks of the 5100 i assume you can't ask or don't know how
many are undocumented but we can't ask and we I know that i know that so what I'm saying that's what we're nervous
about isis ICE is horrific so that's what the concern is we don't even know if any ICE folks have been to the courts
when somebody from the UIistas has been arrested right we don't
know that is that correct that is correct okay i mean that's what we're concerned about if it w to me if it
wasn't that situation I would not be so nervous but that's a concern is that
something that is everybody's aware of and is nervous about i understand the concern at the police department we need
to enforce the laws whether it be for felonies misdemeanors violations
um to ensure public safety and in this case traffic safety okay and so that's
what we are doing here and I think we have been I have certainly been very
clear in um the fact that the New York City Police Department is going to
follow the sanctuary city laws we are not going to engage in civil immigration enforcement thank you very much i know
that uh thanks to Deputy Mayor Mirror Josie when she was here she did send over some good testimony good
legislation which we would love to work with you on on this topic and that could be uh perhaps some answers to the
deliveristas and ebike problems thank you very much thank you okay questions council member Stevens followed by
Rustler i will I will be quick good afternoon um
good afternoon i know in your testimony um it was it was laid out around like since raise the age and gave some
statistics around like the increase and everyone knows I'm really concerned about um young people and the rise of
violence um been working with folks around really having a decarceration plan because the numbers have tripled
but I also want to make sure that in the same role we look at some of the other things and other factors other than
raise the age because that's not the only factor in New York State right now now the unemployment rate for 16 to 24
years old 24 year olds as of April is 14.2% in January March of 2025 there
were over 620,000 young people in that age group were unemployed 59,000 more
from the previous year this was a 13.2% increase and so I think when we're talking about the raise the age and the
factors we're also not factoring in how we have left young people out of the conversation around jobs and
opportunities and all the things and have not given them a lot of opportunities and so I always want to
make sure that we're having a balanced conversation about young people because if the crime rates around young people
are raising that is a failure on every adult that's sitting in this room and so that has to be said and so for me I know
your job as commissioner and the police department is to enforce the law and to
go after crime um but I I have real concern just even going into the summer and I know we had a conversation i am
scared for what the summer is going to look like um I think that we need to be having a real conversation about where these young people are getting guns from
um and how they're getting access to them so frequently and so freely um but also just thinking about what is the
real coordination in the sense of I 100% agree that we should be
deploying more cops in these areas but I also want to make sure that we're also deploying the same amount of resources
so that young people could have opportunities and I know it was shared that they their stat um that stats are
being shared between CMS groups and I know you stated that you meet with them once a week i would love to just know
what are those conversations look like and when you're talking because I've I've been at a couple of shootings where
um there are hundreds of young people out there grieving and I see cops and I don't see anything else so I would love to hear more about what those
conversations are because if you're talking and you're sharing stats then I would hope that at the same time they're
being deployed and don't you worry I'm holding DYCD and the CMS groups just as accountable because I know love people
people love to say that we're in here yelling at y'all that's not true i'm holding them just as accountable in this situation but I would like to know what
does those conversations look like and how are we coordinating these efforts for the summer so Chief Lepet our chief
of crime control strategies is going to respond
as always the conversations start with prevention so those conversations mostly stem from an
analysis of a shooting incident or shots fired in areas of the city where we know
where the retaliate where the retaliatory violence is going to go when you're having those conversations around
prevention um and I know that um you know the commissioner has been very
clear like if they're shot she's she's going to deploy those officers there are you guys also coordinating with the CMS
groups to also deploy to deploy CMS groups out there at the ta same time to support and what does that look like yes
so how how it works look I'm going to give you a great example you know this
past weekend Memorial Day weekend in the Bronx in the 40 the 44 the 46 the 47 and
the 48 we did not have one shooting incident and one confirmed shots fired and how we do that is put 300 extra
offices on those streets for that weekend and for the whole summer so how just how we surge to specific areas we
like CMS to ser to surge to specific Yeah and that's why I'm asking because I wanted to be clear because we cannot
just deploy cops out there because my fear is that we're going to have kids shooting kids and then cops shooting
kids and then that's going to be a cake for a disaster and so for me there needs to be a much more coordinated effort
between all of these groups to ensure the safety of everyone because I'm not
saying that you know you guys shouldn't be there but what I am saying is other resources need to be deployed and so I
want to see a greater effort from everyone to ensure everyone's safety and
so yes I know that there was a lot of cops out there but that doesn't prevent that's not prevention i I understand we
understand we understand that agreed and so again I just I needed to be on the record that's it you know I got to say
it and I need to say it in every space so again I said the same thing to um NYPD my my last question is also just
even around the quality of life division um excited to hear about this because this has been one of the issues that I
feel like often is overlooked in my district because um I have the 44 the 42 and um 46 we are often fighting crime
and have more serious things and so quality of life is always the last thing so I need to know when those will be rolled out and the 44 4642 because it is
essential for us and will they be getting additional cops for those divisions as well so we are going to we
are working on the rollout schedule now and I expect to have it for everyone
this summer to be able to tell everyone when which command is going to be rolled out when but we are going for a citywide
roll out of it based on the success that we've seen in the first um month or two
two months of the pilot that we have been doing and in some commands it will
be um additional officers but in many of
them it will be a reassignment or a refocusing of existing officers in the
commands i would like to go on record that none of my precincts should have reassignments we need additional officers so I need that to be on record
so the 44 42 46 we need additional officers to pull out this division because we have so much I just want to
be very clear i understood but I want to be very clear that this summer you have
gotten in those commands specifically a lot of cops no I hear you i know i know
you told me not everyone here can say that everyone also cannot say the amount of shootings that they have either so
100% and that's and that is exactly what I respond to them when they complain that we're we have to put the cops where
they are needed um and just the last thing this isn't a question this is a comment i know um I know the police's uh
feelings on the gang database and how you know they feel that it can be improved i just again I'm just always
going to stand on the side of things cannot be fixed when it already comes with a broken system a broken clock
could be right twice a day and it things like that just have to go because it it stem from racism and I know that you
have you feel very differently but I'm that's just not going to change it and I know it's in your testimony i was not
gonna bring it up but because you brought it up I'm bring it up and so we are I know we have conversations coming
up to talk about um how you feel about it I feel about it but I just have to say it because you brought it up and so
I just brought it up so that's it thank you guys so much okay have questions from Council Member Wrestler followed by Joseph thank
you uh chairs greatly appreciate your thoughtful leadership uh good to see you Commissioner
i you know I like you um and I think that I don't say that about
everybody um I don't Bob agrees um I think you're smart i think you're a
strong manager and I think you brought real integrity to the department thank you uh since you've returned to the
NYPD I felt it in my community in my commands uh I felt it in the leadership
we've had Chief Obe and Chief Galato out in the district recently um there is
responsiveness and I think cooperation and partnership and you know we've seen how you've I
think brought meaningful oversight and integrity of the department and it's
it's appreciated and I think we're seeing it in terms of safety across our communities as well is improving and I
think it starts with leadership and I I don't want to that's the most important thing I'm going to say today
um it's not to say I agree with all of your policy choices and there are some that I'm concerned about um you know I
thought that at the end of the Melissa Mark Vivivero speakership the criminal justice reform act was a really positive
development for the city where we gave the NYPD more discretion to shift towards civil enforcement rather than
criminal enforcement on a range of different issues and unfortunately what we've seen in the Adams administration
is a major shift away from civil enforcement toward criminal enforcement in a variety of different areas um you
know I can cite them drinking in public you know from the beginning of the administration to the present 91%
increase in criminal summons drink for drinking in public 1360% increase for biking on sidewalks
1458% increase for bike infractions that are commercial uh non-payment of a fair uh is a 233%
increase so we're seeing these significant increases toward criminal enforcement criminal summons instead of
civil and I just broadly is this a trend that you're concerned about do you think that's the right orientation for the
department the um the policy decision that was made
under my tenure so far at the police department to go towards criminal
summones is specific to bike safety and and more specifically ebike safety and
as I have both testified as I've testified here today my thought is um
that the B summons paradigm did not was not working in New York City for very
obvious reasons that these ebikes in New York City are not licensed and therefore
there is no bite there is no nothing behind the B summons because when you
get a a B summons when you're driving a vehicle the concern is you'll either get points on your license or if you don't
respond you will lose your license or have it have it suspended when you talk
about a mode of transportation that is not licensed the B summons is
meaningless certainly virtually meaningless and so if we were going to kick up enforcement around ebikes in New
York City which many of you on the council have asked us to do it would
literally be burning resources to have more cops out there issuing B summones
the only other option that we have available to us under the law as it
currently exists is ca summones and so for that reason and to address what I
have heard from so many people in so many different parts of the the city to
address these their concerns around safety as it relates to ebikes hitting
people pulling their kids out of the way of a ebike careening down the street we needed to do meaningful enforcement and
so this is that meaningful enforcement i want to tell you that anecdotally I
think it's working i'm seeing ebikes like stopping at red lights not a 100%
of the time but certainly more than they used to do which was like virtually never and I will look forward to working
with this council to create a more tailored meaningful viable approach to
uh ebike enforcement and to to working on what laws will will govern it but as
the law stands now the sea summons is the only meaningful enforcement that we
can do and we have to address the public safety concerns that people are raising
broad strokes before the specifics on ebikes you know I've appreciated that as issues have come up at these hearings
such as NYPD response times to the most serious crimes in progress to call times
uh for 911 for call responsiveness on 911 operators and and calls going to recordings you've come back with saying
recognizing these issues and coming up with operational solutions and giving us time frames for when things will get better which I've appreciated i hope
you'll similarly take a look at a shift away from civil toward criminal enforcement in quality of life issues
that do require your attention and I'm not saying should not face civil enforcement but I I'm concerned about
more people getting swept up in our criminal justice system that don't need it and that's I think why so many of us
are concerned particularly about the criminal enforcement on the ebike issues and these other issues where we have a
Trump administration that is trying to sweep everyone up into their deportation machine that they can are you concerned
that this increased criminal enforcement of ebike riders where we have a high
concentration of undocumented people is going to lead to more people getting really wrongly deported and I will
address this that question first and then your larger point after uh at the New York City Police Department we have
to address public safety concerns we have to we have to um uphold our laws and enforce our laws
and so some of those can be felonies misdemeanors
violations it's it is what we have to do
and as it relates to ebikes the only option that we have at this time that is
viable and meaningful is issuing sea summones i do hope and expect that the council is going to work to create a new
framework to govern ebikes so that the sea summons won't be our only viable
option but right now it is and as we uphold all of these laws like are there
potential downstream consequences certainly but the NYPD does not engage
in civil immigration enforcement period
i I I'm not totally satisfied with the answer but I do agree that it would be
helpful for us to collaborate together on a regulatory framework to have better
and more appropriate enforcement i don't think the status quo is working either
in terms of we have dangerous situations with ebikes that need to be addressed and I don't think the enforcement
approach is the best case scenario and that's the thing the status quo doesn't work for pedestrians agreed it also
doesn't work for people who believe and who are desperate to see more bikes on
the road because what we have seen over the past let's say 10 years is like the
explosion of biking in New York City without any
meaningful legal framework to keep everyone safe and when things grow like
that without a regulatory framework they get out of control and right now my
opinion the an opinion that I know is shared by lots of New Yorkers things are out of control and so we need to work
with this council to bring it back under control and put in place a sensible framework to address it as to your
question about the move to criminalize I will look at those numbers and I will be
prepared soon to have a meaningful conversation with you i believe in the
spirit of those reforms that um you
mentioned but I just want to have more specific numbers in my head before we engage i appreciate you saying that very
much i'll just say this in closing i don't um I don't I don't You know I have
not signed on to Council Member Holden's bill i don't I think that we need a broader conversation about how to hold
the app companies accountable in this that we can't just be focused on enforcement of the bike riders it has to
be a broader approach and if if the police department is interested in engaging the diverse cross-section of
council members on this topic for how we can solve for this I would welcome I would be happy to be a part of those
conversations but my opinion my opinion generally is that we cannot live in a
consequence-free environment bad things come from that and right now the way uh
the B summons worked is ebikes were generally living and working in a
consequence-free environment and my hope is that this council when they pass
whatever reforms are going to be made around ebikes and biking generally in New York City is we will not repeat that
mistake of creating a consequence-free environment i would welcome further conversations with your team on that to
try and craft a regulatory environment that that is enforceable and effective um so I appreciate the time and I I just
want to thank your team is going to meet with us about some of the crime data in the 84 next week and I appreciate that i hope we can get some attention on that
soon thank you okay questions from council member Joseph followed by Hudson
thank you chairs commissioner how are you i have a couple of questions one
what is the rule around fair evasion there was an incident in my district with a gentleman who got on the on the
bus who didn't pay his fair but the way he was treated it took seven officers to subdue someone for $2.90
and if I recall correctly I know the the the council had passed a bill that there
should be education and then enforcement that if you do take someone for fair evasion they should you should notify
them that there's fair affairs i didn't see that happen in that video we can have a offline conversation and show you
what transpired in my community and it's it's unacceptable right for 290 took seven officers to put one gentleman in a
car yeah i I would have to take a look so MTA works us with Eagle teams with NY
team offices as well with bus enforcement so I'd be happy to look at that and see see what happened and and
work closely with you yeah I would love to do that because I don't want that to happen cuz I'm sure that could have happened to one of my older adults who
got on the bus and didn't pay their fairs but you know we want to make sure that it was a lot to watch and and and
it was very aggressive for $2.90 understood i'm happy to work with you on that thank you um um has OM and um the
Office of Labor Relations made progress in the salary for assistant school safety agents yes yes so for the uh
assistant school safety agent title that has been established it's
$37,000 and we are looking to hire our first first group of assistant school safety agents in July and that's the
official title yes if yes the salary is Can you repeat that again uh yeah I'm going to get you the
exact amount it's uh 37,000 but and how many have you hired we we haven't hired
any yet because we are waiting for the certification from the state and then the establishment of the official salary
so the first class will be in July and what type of training drawn out the modified training for assistant school
safety agents what type of training will they receive
where is it hi good afternoon Inspector Tracy Mlette good afternoon Inspector
thank you ma'am they will receive eight weeks of training that will encounter physical fitness as well as NYPD New
York City public schools uh rules and regulations visitor protocol also
they'll learn about restorative justice as well as dealing with child in crisis and deescalation will be part of that
training as well as these are what was the age group for hiring school safety assistants
18 17 depending on how advanced they are I guess if they finish high school but definitely high school no older than 21
everyone under than 21 and deescalation is part of the training um and what type of uniform will they have they'll have
the uh light blue uniform with the patch on the side that'll say assistant school safety agent how will you be able to
differentiate them the patch and then also they won't have a shield on them
they won't have a shield and how many of these positions will be funded at so we
got approval for 400 and how do you how how you decide where you place them in the schools they'll be
placed in the elementary schools and that'll be determined with communication definitely collaboration with New York
City public school system as well as the incidents that there as well as the population and the funding will be is it
an intra agency funding between New York City public schools and NYPD just like school safety agents yes it is ma'am and
when um go ahead sorry just the exact salary for the school safety agent is 37,339
and why why um elementary schools just because they're just still coming out of
high school uh ele high school they're just graduating we figured elementary a
smaller environment younger kids it'll be an easy assimilation for them okay thank you thank you chairs just a note
uh it just came out last night it is out the link for the job so all can apply
that in that age group and we sent you the link ma'am thank you okay questions from Council Member
Hudson thank you chairs hello Commissioner i have several questions so bear with me here um in 2023 individuals
aged 60 and older across the country lost a staggering 3 60 or 16
60 lost a staggering $3.4 billion to fraud here in New York City our older
adult population has grown by more than 30% over the past decade and it's projected to grow another 40% by 2040 as
financial crimes become more sophisticated with advancing technology how's the NYPD using its budget to
protect one of our largest and most vulnerable populations i'm going to ask uh Chief Kenny our chief of detectives
who oversees financial crimes in those so in in a normal instance like this when the crime takes place the numbered
squad or the local squad would take that case but then the financial crimes task force would be brought in to enhance
that and then some instances even the major case unit would be brought in to follow up because a lot of these crimes
as we know leave to interstate um crime uh criminals so we also use our federal
partners as well so we do work very closely with the FBI and HSI in regards to financial crime do you think given
the um increase in population that's going to be expected over the next 15 years that perhaps resources should be
uh directed towards that division we we do fill in as as need be but you know as
we've been speaking about uh you know for majority of these hearings we are short staffing um that's why we do have
the numbered squads pitch in to help out when need be okay thank you
um the statistics you shared uh in your testimony about gun arrests and shooters
for children under the age of 18 are staggering yes in 2022 I introduced
legislation that would require the NYPD commissioner to provide guidance to its uniformed officers on determining
whether to use criminal enforcement or divert young people to a community-based organization to receive essential
services in lie of arrest and this has been demonstrated as successful in in precincts in Brooklyn our goal was to
provide young people with the services and resources they need that are pushing them to resort to crime has the NYPD
explored such a program and if not would you support such a program and does the NYPD have existing programs that divert
young people to programs or services in lie of arrest when criminal activity is identified so I I have not looked at
that piece of legislation from 2022 but if you'll give me just a few days I will take a look at it and happy to follow up
with you on it as for the diversion programs uh Chief Leetri is going to
speak to that good morning good morning so Good
afternoon good afternoon you've been here that long
when the police commissioner came in um she asked me to to to look at youth crime youth violence but also you know
how to deal with at risk youth prior to them committing a serious crime or a gun
rellated crime so one of the things that the NYPD instituted was the juvenile crime desk now falls under crime control
strategies my bureau and and we are an extremely datadriven bureau that that looks at not
just crime but looks at indicators that somebody might be either a victim or a
perpetrator in a crime this is specifically looking at juveniles so one thing that we are in that we will be
instituting is the ceasefire program with juveniles we've never done that before though some get mixed in but
we're primarily focused on adults so I think the ceasefire program including you know just with juveniles is
something that we can really really do well and when we start I can reach out to you and you can maybe come to uh one
of the meetings that'd be great thank you and um just so you know Commissioner it's intro 254 thank you
um the bill um a couple of um district specific
questions and then I have a broader question um are you familiar with a program
called to protect serve and understand that's put on by a performing arts group called Irondale i am not okay uh for
nearly a decade they've used theater to help police and community members build trust and understanding i went to the
you know 10-year anniversary celebration we had um former uh you
know folks from the police department i don't remember all their titles um but officers were permitted to attend the
sessions and participate in the 10-week long program however we've been informed
that um the NYPD earlier this month was cancelling this program um in order to
put more uniforms on the street the program only requires seven officers for a total commitment of 56 hours over 10
weeks and less than $20,000 annually to fund the program which builds trust in the community um if you're not familiar
with the program then I won't ask if you can explain why it was cancelled i'm not I'm not familiar with the program um but
each deputy commissioner and each burough chief has to make some really difficult decisions in um a tough
environment in terms of staffing and so the program that you're talking about would fall under our community affairs
bureau run by deputy commissioner Mark Stewart and so I recommend that you follow up with him on why he made the
assessment to cut participation in that program great we'll do thank you
um and then uh while Council Member Brewer continues to look for the Manhattan toebound I want to ask if you
have a plan to get both official and personal police vehicles off of pedestrian sidewalks at every precinct
in my district parked cars come right up to the tree pits which leaves space that's too narrow for me to pass with my
kids stroller let alone if somebody has a wheelchair um or a cane or some other type of mobility impairment and I'm
wondering if there's a plan to return pedestrian space to pedestrians and put police cars in proper parking spots and
even garages so in my mind I look at this in in two different two different pieces the first is the parking around
precincts the second is very basic citywide parking plaque
enforcement not in this specific area dealing with um with precinct parking
but like for example using a plaque to to leave a car like in a bike lane or
Yeah and I'm not even trying to address that i'm addressing specifically on the block of the precincts oh so you're
doing you're talking about category number one police yeah category number one police cars they're it's their
personal vehicles that when they come you know for their shift they're parking and it's it's perpendicular to the
sidewalks and half the cars on our um deputy commissioner of legal matters is overseeing the work in of this
department in this area okay so then there are a number of different pieces to this um and and you know there there
is a piece right which is a um a structural piece longterm in terms of just the parking setup around certain
commands there are just real challenges right we do need to have parking for the officers but from a compliance
perspective I want you to know that one of the priorities we have at compliance stat is this very issue so obviously
compliance we have to select you know what what are the compliance issues we're really focused on um and one of
them is parking around precincts uh we will devote time to you know we have um folks from professional standards going
out uh analyzing what's happening around precincts taking photos calling cos to
account right having them at the podium right and saying okay hold on you're the CEO of this command look at this photo
this is totally unacceptable for the reasons council member you articulated uh and I think we are affecting a lot of
change obviously we're happy to follow up in terms of the particular command yeah I don't think anybody's come and taken any photos of the the precincts in
my district I'm happy to provide the photos I'm happy to come out with the inspector whoever does the investigations
um but it's a it's a real issue and it's a multifaceted issue obviously each precinct is unique and the areas that
they serve and you know lack of parking and all of that but in some cases like in the 88 the cars are in the bike lane
and also you know the bus lane at times could be so we need to we need to know about that okay we we will definitely
focus on that both at compliance stat and with our newly centralized inspections teams whose job it is to go
out into the field and look for just that type of condition okay okay and one
other thing I do want to mention about that specifically is that in the 78 when some of the newer buildings went up as
part of Atlantic Yards there were uh parking spots allocated for the police department that are not used so our
deputy commissioner of management and budget is definitely going to be following up with you on that you got you got some somebody for everything i
love it yeah well we we had already reached out about that issue uh and so we will follow up to make sure that they
got the message okay and then just one uh friendly recommendation please as we
look to build new housing when the city is building city subsidized buildings one thing that I
fought for that I wasn't able to get was if you're already building parking spots or parking will be included in a
building and it's near a police precinct why not allow police cars to be parked
amen in that so glad we agree on that one um but that's like an internal agency to
agency thing i know i still say amen yeah yeah I know because the other agencies they don't want to give you all the parking um okay question about
overtime in your testimony you mentioned reductions in overtime including a combined savings of $40.4 million over
the just the first four months of 2025 compared to last year and you've also stated that none of this has come at the
expense of public safety do you have a goal in terms of the amount you're trying to reduce overtime or the cost of
overtime by uh or is there a specific number by which you're aiming to reduce overtime so essentially if we had
continued on the trajectory we were going we estimate that we would have spent over 1.2 billion about 1.23
billion in fiscal year 25 and our projection right now obviously there's still a month left in the fiscal year uh
is that we will be about 1.1 billion so
that you will be 1.1 billion over no that the total spend would be 1.1
billion versus 1.23 on a trajectory for for the for the 1.23 billion and that did not include in
the first half of the year the additional transit initiatives that we took on the second half of the year so
that's incorporating with this additional allocation of resources which is partially on overtime still being
able to bring that number down by about $130 million from what we projected would have been had we not put these
efforts in place to manage the overtime more effectively so is that the goal reduction by 130 from what we were
projecting yes okay and that's the goal for this fiscal correct and what will
the goal be for next fiscal so we are working right now with the office of management budget and internally to look
at what we think that'll be i mean our objective is obviously to continue what we've been doing and to continue to see
those reductions and to continue to see the the most effective use of our
resources so I I don't have that number yet but I I anticipate that we'll be you
know working to keep it as tight as possible we continue to do what we are
do what we've been doing since January in terms of management of overtime it is
somewhat inconceivable that overtime next fiscal year will be higher than this fiscal
year just because the first six months of the year there was so much spending
great that's good news um if the chairs will allow I'd like one more question thank you um what is the NYPD's current
clearance rate for major crimes and how do these rates shift when broken down demographically by race ethnicity or
neighborhood uh given persistent disparities in public concern what concrete steps are being taken to
improve transparency boost investigative performance and rebuild trust in the communities that are most affected by
serious crime that's a lot it is and I'm happy to repeat whatever you need no I I what I'm trying to say is that certain
you know every crime has a different clearance rate basically but I'll just give you um some highlights and some
some things that I am very proud of because of the collaboration with all the bureaus shoplifting is one of them
we we right now in some commands are seeing well over a 50% clearance rate in
shoplifting and and that's because of uh a very precise plan to look at
recidivists but also look at locations that repeatedly get hit so our but is
that sorry is shoplifting considered a major crime it could be it could be grand lararseny it could be petty
larseny or it could be also a robbery because people go in to steal merchandise and then use force upon
leaving it becomes a robbery if you look at if you look at the murders I mean you know historically we're at approximately
a 70% uh clearance rate and when you look 70 and when you look at you you
look at the burrow that has the best clearance rates it's the Bronx you know again because we put more detectives in
the Bronx we put more resources in the Bronx unfortunately because it's 37% of the shootings in New York City um when
you look at uh our robberies you know we're usually at a 40 to 45% clearance
rates on robberies so throughout the years uh I've seen throughout the five years that that I've really been honing
in on the data when it comes to clearance rates they've only they've only increased in in all of our majors
and also our our shootings and our uh shots fired um great if you can maybe
follow up with the the demographics by race ethnicity and neighborhood that
would be helpful i will give homework to my analysts thank you no problem you're welcome thank you okay just
acknowledging we've been joined by Council Member Rivera and with that we're going to uh close this out thank

thanks
okay welcome back everyone welcome to the second portion
of what is this day 12 day 12 of executive budget hearings who's counting
um Councilman Justin Brandon i am the chair of the finance committee i'm pleased to once again be joined by my
friend and colleague Council Member Salam who chairs the committee on public safety and we're joined uh for this portion by the mayor's office of
criminal justice uh we've been joined by Council Members Sanchez and Rivera um
welcome Director Logan and your team thank you for joining us today to answer our questions uh on May 1st the
administration released the executive financial plan for FY26 to 29 with a proposed FY26 budget of
$115.1 billion mach's proposed FY26 budget of
844.9 million represents less than 1% of the administration's proposed FY26
budget in the executive plan this is an increase of 60.6 6 million uh from the
originally allocated 784.3 million in the preliminary plan back in January this net increase is
mostly due to uh an increase in personal services spending uh as of March 2025 MACJ had 51
vacancies relative to their FY25 budgeted headcount my questions will
largely focus on Mach Jay's work with public defenders work with nonprofits that provide re-entry services and
overall funding issues and challenges uh sitting city contracting delays have long been a problem with our nonprofits
but these delays directly affect a person's ability to have a defense in court when they cannot afford
representation further questions will involve how Mach is upholding its agreement in the efforts to close
Riker's Island before we get started I again want to thank Jack Story and Casey Lysky Owen Katowski everyone from the
finance team uh back across the street at mission control and over here today for making these hearings possible i'm
now going to turn it over to my committee council Brian Saro who will swear everyone in and we can get started
good afternoon do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this committee and to
respond honestly to council member questions director Logan I do chief
Daniel I do officer Fiato I do and Officer Julian I do you may begin
go ahead thank you good afternoon good afternoon Chair
Salam Chair Brandon esteemed council members who are here in spirit uh thank you for the
opportunity to present our FY26 executive budget and priorities i'm
Danna Logan and I have the privilege of leading the mayor's office of criminal
justice joining me here today is our chief of staff Norah Daniel our chief
financial officer Robert Fiato and our chief operating officer Candace Julian i
imagine with all of the moving parts that are happening right now in New York City the evolution of our agency in
recent years may not be what's front of mind for the council and that's fine if
I at least get you all to remember that Mach is an essential service in the
public safety continuum that is designed to make a
difference not headlines the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice
is an agency and that's a big thing to say we are an agency on the rise doing
invaluable work to help reduce our jail population address hate crimes stop
those that seek to reduce our housing stock and make our neighborhoods safer by breaking cycles of criminal behavior
that plague New Yorkers we work with the office of court administration with defense attorneys with the district
attorneys to improve our justice system using data to innovate pilot programs
you won't find anywhere in the United States we empower justice justice
impacted New Yorkers to make safer transitions back into the community we
don't want anyone spending one day more or one day less in jail than necessary
at the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice we bring stakeholders together to create
solutions now we're doing it under our own standalone agency code as well
having completed a two-year transition that improved our information technology
human resources and oversight capabilities for the upcoming fiscal year our
executive budget proposes yes you've stated it hundreds of millions of dollars to sustain our vital programs
today I'll explain why that's not an expense but rather an investment for New
York City and the people of New York City our core programs that start off with
re-entry programs providing meaningful pathways for New Yorkers to successfully
return home from incarceration is essential for the benefit of both the
individual and the neighborhoods that they call home individuals with criminal records often
face immense challenges finding housing stable job access to medical care
continuing their education and just being supported in their humanity as
people and citizens our programs help bridge those gaps we allocate $26 million a year to
re-entry initiatives that include discharge planning while people are still on Rikers and in prison employment
support and comprehensive services after release to help stabilize life for
justice involved persons and their families our office also directs $32 million
annually to alternatives to incarceration efforts known as ATIs this program helps reduce
incarceration by offering structured alternatives to jail for more than 5,000
New Yorkers each year we address root issues like mental health substance
misuse while holding participants accountable connecting individuals to
important services while keeping them in their communities often with their
families helps lower incarceration rates recidivism rates and costs to taxpayers
the mayor's office of criminal justice lends leads pre-trial innovation including our successful supervised
release program that was introduced in 2016 supervised release gives judges the
option to release individuals with supervision into stable situations that
maintains them closer to their families similar to our alternatives to
incarceration we provide assistance in attending court accessing employment
services getting referrals for treatment when necessary thousands benefit from support
supportive supervision each year instead of sitting in jail
when I was here last month I told you about our pilot providing intensive support for high needs individuals
operating in Queens and in Manhattan this pilot is the epitome of how we use
data to innovate solutions individuals with higher needs must be supported by people with more
experienced clinical supports and expertise infusing highly specific person centered
care in our services means that more experienced clinical staff support fewer
individuals and thus increase the amount of time they spend with each client
addressing the client's specific needs in this pilot our ability to review the
research data and real time testing of the service models is yielding some very
promising early results including significantly lowering rearrest and
non-compliance rates we are looking forward to share more as the pilot
continues a foundational building block of stability is housing
without reliable place to leave your things and come back to individuals
leaving jail or prison are far more likely to spiral and find themselves
once again navigating the criminal legal system providing someone the stability
of a home they will be less likely to fall back into the cycles of crime
participants in our program are about 30% less likely to be rearrested in the
year after transitional housing compared to where they were the year prior to entering that transitional housing
this program evolved from a pandemic era emergency program into a remarkable
sustainable system that helps thousands of individuals every year with hundreds
of people leveraging that support to find stability but more importantly to
get safe permanent housing these programs work and a significant
part of this work that must not be forgotten is that the providers of all
of the services that we contract for are caring professionals who ensure that
they offer solutions centered on the people that they are
serving given the essential foundation housing provides we also fight to keep
the housing market affordable for all New Yorkers through the work of our office of special
enforcement their efforts to combat illegal short-term rental preserves housing for local renters and stability
for New York neighborhoods in the two years since council passed local law 18
and it took effect we've seen the world's largest online booking sites
remove illegal short-term rentals and return housing stock to New York from
their New York listings in partnership with the Department of Buildings and the Fire Department
they're ensuring residential spaces remain safe livable and most importantly
available to New Yorkers our Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes is small but mighty team
innovating new ways to tackle bias and hate and they're setting examples for
the rest of the country we work with the New York City Police Department community organizations other
stakeholders to educate deescalate and support affected communities we fund
grassroots initiatives under the partners against the hate program and we support the breaking bread building
bonds initiative launched by Mayor Adams mcj works hard to preserve a cornerstone
of justice for tens of thousands of New Yorkers equal access to legal
defense we coordinate the city's provision of criminal indigent legal services including convict council cases
that are handled by the assigned council plan working collaboratively with the state we ensure that the city affords
quality representation for all especially those who cannot afford
private counsel to better manage this work we created a
dedicated legal team focused on contracts and fiscal matters which
helped our finance staff register all not one but all contracts on time for
fiscal 25 for our indigent legal work and we're on track to repeat that
success in FY26 with dozens of mockj programs and
hundreds of MACHJ partners it would take me hours and I know that you're in lunch break so you don't want me to take hours
to detail all of the impact work that the impact our work is having across New
York but please indulge me with a few highlights that you should know about
one is Project Reset it's a fantastic second chance program helping low-level
nonviolent offenders avoid criminal records through pre-arrainment diversion
programs restorative justice is a program that uses the time-tested
strategy of bringing parties together to promote healing as well as public safety
project Restore Bedstey is a deterrence pilot that was a collaboration with the
Office of the Kings County District Attorney and Columbia University Social Relations Lab that afforded 30 young men
the agency to exit cycles of gun and gang violence and offered a new
deescalation model for cities everywhere flip the Script featured on Fox News
earlier this week is a program for justice involved youth in Brownsville who are now working apprenticeships in
the film industry and we are very much looking forward to them producing their own movie that is going to receive a red
carpet premiere later this year our CDL training and employment program
which last week was also featured nationally on CBS News for its stunning
success in helping justice involved New Yorkers get six figure jobs in the
trucking industry change is hard work and we're up for it we're doing that work while we
don't expect to fix every challenge in our criminal justice system we are making it fairer for the individuals in
the system we're improving safety and the health of communities across New
York City with a front row seat to how our investments are improving lives i
can confidently say your investment in the mayor's office of criminal justice
now its own standalone agency will help advance your constituents priorities as
well thank you for the opportunity to discuss our solutions and I look forward
to our continued partnership in advancing justice and safety
thank you very much for your testimony uh I want to jump right in here um
talking about contracts so a significant portion of MACHJ's uh FY26 executive
budget is allocated for contracts just wanted to go over some general info about uh Mach's contracting budget uh in
the preliminary plan back in January MACJ was allocated $135,000 in addition to baseline funding
for additional contract staff so could you tell us how many staff budgeted and actual do you have working to process
payments and contracts thank you i'll have our chief operating officer who has been dig diligently
working on staffing us up i'm very proud to say that we are very different place
of vacancies sitting before you today thank you for the question uh dedicated
to contracts we have uh 11 staffers
and what are the titles of those positions they range from our agency chief
contracting officer deputy agency chief contracting officer contract manager
senior contract manager contract analysts and we do have a Dcast pathway
fellows who is on the procurement and finance track do you would you like more
staffers or or is 11 enough to handle the capacity we do have 11 staffers we
have um a staffer in the onboarding process and one vacancy that we are in
the process of interviewing for so you're budgeted for 13 correct okay and
what's the average number of contracts being handled by each of those folks it varies by their uh seniority by their
title uh our contract managers can handle more complex uh um contracts
where they can manage upwards of 14 contracts uh and also it depends
on the task at hand um so uh yeah did you um have you designated a uh chief
nonprofit officer yes we have okay is that included in those 13 no
and who who is the chief nonprofit officer the chief nonprofit officer is the deputy agency chief contracting
officer for operations and what's the person's name monica Moy
okay and is that is that a standalone position or was it a responsibility
added to their existing role responsibility added to an existing role
how much of a city council discretionary award value is available to an organization immediately
can you repeat the question how much of a city council discretionary award is available to an organization immediately
going to defer to our chief financial officer yes chair it depends on when the contract is registered we have
approximately $24 million in city council discretionary contracts within the agency so it all depends on the
contract registration process uh for fiscal 26 as director Logan mentioned
we're on track for timely registration to begin the fiscal year on a good foot with all of our providers
okay um now that the cuts to uh alternatives
to incarceration and re-entry have been restored to the FY25 levels and the
points of agreement lists ATI as a priority to close Rikers is there any plan to expand funding for these
programs in the coming years
so through the um through the uh restoration to the FR25 levels we are
able to keep all of our providers whole and maintain the current services within ATI we continue to conduct research and
work with our research and development teams to make sure that we understand the needs of ATI so as we continue to
understand the data better and to get a better understanding of what's needed across the system we um that is
something that we will continue to discuss with OB and what's the current funding amounts for ATI and re-entry
services ati is budgeted at 54 million in fiscal
26 and re-entry is budgeted at 31.7 million in fiscal 26 as well
so and in light of potential federal cuts to Medicaid and other federal mental health funding um which we know
would directly impact the nonprofit providers who offer re-entry and discharge planning and mental health
related treatment has MCJ considered enhancing funds for re-entry and ATI providers
so we know that will likely I mean we are monitoring the situation we likely
would not have enough funding to be able to cover everything but we're continuing to monitor have you have you asked OM
for more money so we're continuing to monitor with our providers and our providers we're
continuing to work with them to make sure that they're able to maintain the levels of services that we have now okay
staying on the federal uncertainty as we know legal services are essential
service to the city uh especially uh facing attacks from the federal government on due process and
immigration and family separation um we also know that since the pandemic
nonprofit nonprofit legal service providers have suffered massive rates of attrition particularly uh among their
most experienced attorneys um nonprofits can't retain these workers and New Yorkers go without experienced lawyers
uh who remain and the lawyers who remain have unsustainable case loads so I know right
now uh many of these nonprofits are actively bargaining with their unions to reach fair contracts with wages that
will stay hopefully save off attrition some of these negotiations are heading towards contract expiration dates at the
end of this month or next month June um what is MACHJ doing to ensure that
funding is in place to meet the contract demands of these unions
thank you very much for the question chair we have been working with uh our indigent defense portfolio to understand
what their needs are and we've also been talking to our portfolio team at OM uh
currently as of this week the Office of Management and Budgets uh used gave each
one of our partners the flexibility to use some of the funding that they are
receiving for FY26 to address some funding for
additional salary increases for staff in order for retention and we continue to
work with the indigent uh defense portfolio uh teams to understand where
and how funding may or may not be needed so that we can have those discussions with OM and afford additional
flexibility okay so is OM aware of this concern i
mean obviously we want to you know stave off a possible court shutdown in July which would be chaotic um is OM aware
om is aware of the status okay um this last from me so in the FY26
budget uh the city allocated an additional 20 million for public public defenders performing criminal trials and
appeals work uh the intent uh of the initiative is to support staffing um in
uh the criminal practice uh while this funding is sorely needed Mach has limited how it may be used um is there a
reason why we're we're sort of tying public defenders hands by restricting the use of their
funding particularly because we're we're capping salary increases to 3%
much of the much of the the way that we as a city manage the
attorney pool that we have across the city is in giving everyone the ability
to give raises at a certain in a certain range and to make sure that we continue
to have par across providers and as we look at each of the providers as we look
at the market as a whole we will continue to review and see what makes
the most sense in how those those that flexibility is given again we continue
to talk to OM we look across where everyone is and we will continue to work
to what would be a fair and equitable resolution of of this okay am I correct
in that the city is limiting the city's basically the city is explicitly stating
uh that the funding cannot be used to support salary increases above the city's pattern of 3%
the city has been very clear that whatever the providers use their funding
for their overall funding is going to stay the same because that's where we are within the portfolio but there has
been flexibility in the ability to give raises
okay I'm going to turn over to uh Chair Salam thank you very much thank you Chair and good
afternoon going to start with uh changes changes to the plan in fiscal year 26
executive plan 14 positions are being transferred from various agencies into Mach J one from Administration of
Children's Services six from the Department of Corrections four from the Department of Finance and three from the
Department of Probation along with $559,369 in fiscal year 25 and $19
million baseline beginning in fiscal year 26 can you tell us what the purpose of
what was the purpose of this transfer and which programs or services will Mach be taking over from these agencies
thank you for the question uh as mentioned earlier um and as you're well aware of we are a new agency uh so the
transfer of headcount was a technical adjustment moving active staffers into
uh the newly formed agency um so there's no changes to services it was simply a
technical budget adjustment
and I'm not sure if this was already stated but can you please list the titles of each position that has been transferred
i will be able to send that to you after the hearing if that's possible thank you
definitely this plan reflects an additional $20 million baselineed for the city's public defenders which
includes $375,000 baseline for three additional personnel what three positions are being
added
the 375,000 is for agency operations and the three positions
funded are for our IT functionality human resources and
legal and how is the full $20 million increase being utilized to benefit public defenders
the mayor stated an intention with funding the $20 million increase is for the legal service providers to hire new
attorneys to assist with case load and intake assignment increases but as director Logan mentioned there is
flexibility for the providers to utilize that funding in accordance with their own internally identified needs um
working with ourselves and OMB to ensure that that money is spent in line with mock JS and the city's objectives with
promoting a fair and equitable indigen defense
system the plan includes $4 million in baseline funding for project reset what
specific services will these funds support
so project reset is early um it's pre-arraignment diversion so um it
provides services for um low-level misdemeanors um for people who are
entering the system that way moreover we just want to make sure that you're aware chair that not only does it
invest in people by providing them services it also is part of case
processing as the number of cases that are arraigned that uh each year is
reduced by the individuals that never actually get brought into the court system and so it is a vital part of not
only um serving New Yorkers but also ensuring that the criminal justice system is addressing the cases that they
most need to look at and keep us within our 24-hour time frame for arraignment
$5.9 million is reflected in this plan for human services cost of living new
need in fiscal year 2026 and 2025 and 2026 can you please clarify which
providers will receive these increases and why is this funding only included for two years
this is technically a technical adjustment for Mach so the human service
collo funding was announced last March by Mayor Adams and we were funded in addition uh initial allocation last
fiscal year the new need that you're referencing for 5.9 million is to essentially make us whole for that
funding and it affects most of our providers we
um have 159 contracts with 64 vendors so the vast majority of those vendors will
be eligible and are funded for the 3% increase in fiscal 25 3% in 26 and then
another 3% in 27
you said 3% through 27 3% annually beginning in 25 and then 26 and 27
okay I'm going to move to the points of agreement update this past
April and then again in this past this past Friday we received updates from MACJ regarding the points of agreement
which was originally created in 2019 upon reviewing the document I have questions concerning the methodology as
well as regarding the points themselves so the most recent update does not
include any financial or dollar amounts for the points listed but you have assured the council that you are working
on it so can we when can we expect to see funding amounts in these updates
we can get that to you at the at the next um update we usually update them
annually um and so we can add that add that to the next update and if you there's anything you'd like
to see sooner or anything we can provide to you we're happy to do so
and what was the methodology when creating this document are these updates a collection of responses from each
individual agency or did mockj compile these updates on on your own and did the
individual agencies report their status status complete status ongoing status
done with ongoing work or was that determined by MACJ itself
just to update my answer we're we're committing to updating the monthly now the the POAS and um we worked with each
agency to determine what the status of the specific um POA was and then
assigned a um and then we work with them to to make sure that it was accurate in
terms of how it's described
one of the points listed under MACHJ is the is this document is in this document
rather is to publicly track progress on commitments the 2025 update states that
MACHJ is committed to providing regular updates both in person and online considering that the April 25 update was
the first update posted since 2002 and then we received the following update within a month how often should
we expect updates in the future and if this was a priority for Mach J why is it three years before we received our first
update so we did have some staffing challenges
in terms of um some continuity issues but we are now committed to um to
updating them on a monthly basis
as recent at at a recent criminal justice hearing you said that you were working on additional on adding these
updates rather to your online tracker how has this process been moving
so for now we're updating it um manually with uh with a PDF but we are still
working through the IT challenges to be able to update the overall
website and we are continuing to post them on our website so will we receive funding
amounts in next month's update yes we can we can work on that
regarding the community justice and innovation fund the points of agreement states that the city funding match is
dependent on private dollars what work is mock J doing to find appropriate
funding sources so we are continuing
to tr try to find um appropriate private funding sources we currently have a unit
within mockj that works directly on um innovative pilots and so that is one way
we are continuing to work toward innovation um but we are committed to continue to work with um private funders
to to seek that funding i'm going to move to the council
budget response the council included several proposals in our budget response that emphasized recommendations made by
the Lipmani Commission in their budget blueprint to close Riker so my question
is how were the Litman commission's funding recommendations considered when
finalizing the executive plan and did you discuss these commitments with the Litman commission since the plan was
released thank you we were the benefit of
actually having Litman Commission folks kind of preview for us where they were in terms of the recommendations uh many
of the the suggestions and the recommendations in the report match a lot of work that is being
done now and so as we look at uh working with our weekly updates with DOC with
correctional health we are incorporating a lot of that work in that weekly meeting the the projects that have been
prioritized and funded for the Department of Correction meet some of the the
the areas that the Litman Commission highlighted very specifically case
processing is one of the areas that they highlighted and we are working to ensure that people who are detained are getting
access to the materials that they need in order to meaningfully help in their
own defense by having opportunity to review evidence and to annotate it and
to talk to their council about it in a more timely fashion which then supports
all of the work that Litman has been working with office of court administration and we too have been talking with the office of court
administration about how to timely move cases through the system and reduce the time that
people are spending on records the council called on the administration
in our budget response to expand the supervised release intensive case management pilot by providing an
additional $46 million per the Litman Commission's recommendation the executive plan
included an increase of $9.1 million in fiscal year 26 how was it decided that
this amount would be adequate to expand this program and what does this expansion entail and lastly what is the
rationale to fund this expansion for only one year
the $9.1 million you're referencing chair is a specific new need spitted by Mach for our intensive case management
program which is a component of the supervised release program um providing
intense services for those who are in need of further outreach from the agency
and from our providers so the 9.1 million is a specific mockj program related to our $ 109 million supervised
release program the pilot began last fiscal year it continued into fiscal 25
and the 9.1 continues to pilot into fiscal 26
thank you chair that's all for me
okay thank you all very much appreciate your testimony thank you thank you okay

okay first panel we have Pali Basat
uh Aracelda Skinner Arisa Skinner Jane Fox
uh Jesse Stefen and Juval Scott
jane you want to start is that working okay thank you uh good
afternoon my name is Jane Fox i'm the chair of the Legal Aid Society Attorneys Union i represent,00 attorneys out of
the 3,400 legal service workers at the association of legal advocates and attorneys we are UAW local 2325 and I'm
here to talk about the contract campaign that is happening right now at the legal aid society we have been bargaining with
the legal aid society management since March and have yet to receive any
economic offers from them in fact we found out this morning that earlier this week they told our sister investigators
unit that they will not have an economic offer until June 24th our contract expires in 32 days on
June 30th today our members are walking on practice pickets across four burrows and this afternoon we return to the
bargaining table for more negotiations and while we are committed to bargaining in good faith with our employers and
while we do not want to strike we are prepared to withhold our labor to win better wages for the long term and we do
not intend to work on an expired contract in March I testified about the
attrition crisis that is decimating our ranks our wages have not kept pace in
fact the salaries of New York City public defenders rank dead last among
defenders in 14 major cities when adjusted for cost of living we make a
sliver of what our union siblings at the federal defenders make we do not have a defined benefit pension and we are not
in the state retirement system and we are now also facing an attack on federal student loan relief programs that
threaten to burn up our salary gains and destroy hiring and retention in legal services for decades to
come budgets are value statements our clients workingclass New Yorkers deserve
the absolute best legal representation they do not deserve less than any rich
person in this city and if you'll permit me just to finish when you devalue us
you devalue the people we serve and if you continue underfunding us we will see the attrition attrition crisis speed up
your constituents will be increasingly represented by less and less experienced attorneys with higher case loads they
will not get justice and that is not accept an acceptable outcome to us and it shouldn't be acceptable to you by our
employer's estimate this council needs to increase funding to the Legal Aid Society by at least $74 million to make
sure our demands at the bargaining table are met and specifically at Legal Aid we are one union and our members are on the
same salary scale regardless of which court they practice in or which contract they are paid on public safety is more
than just public defense and that's why it's essential the city allocate can measure it increases in the adopted
budget to housing and immigration contracts so our employer can meet our core economic demands to retain
experienced staff and incre with increased salaries and provide a dignified path to retirement the money
our communities need for experienced attorneys and robust public defense is a fraction compared to what this council
and this city spends on law enforcement 250 million uh 205 million in 2024 for
NYPD settlements and as you heard earlier an estimated $1.1 billion in
NYPD overtime the funding we need is well within your reach you have the
power to value your own communities by investing in us and if in if negotiations do not improve in the next
month we are prepared to withhold our labor and interrupt essential city services to win a fair contract we are
fighting for us and for the working-class New Yorkers who deserve nothing less than than the best thank
you thank you very much hi and good afternoon my name is Arisa
Skinner i am the 911 operators from New York NYPD's local president i am here
again to testify that we are in a New York City crisis with the 911 operators
we are currently as stated this afternoon at a headcount of,210 members
a vacancy of budgeted allegedly at 1412 sir we don't have enough operators to
answer the crisis of New York City we don't have enough operators to dispatch New York City officers EMS or FDNY into
any locations of any of New York City the 911 operators are currently working
16-hour tours 5 days a week some are working four days a week 16-hour tours
operators handle about a million 10 million calls a year we don't have
enough they We're losing 60 to 80 operators every three months it takes us
three months to hire operators and to train them we're losing operators sooner than we are actually hiring them again
New York City is about to go into a crisis we do not have operators to answer your calls of emergency calls and
that's how simple I'm going to keep this testimony thank you
this is not about the uh MIPD it's more the FDNY but we were told we could come down here and um speak today speaking on
FDNYMS uh okay sure yeah okay so I just want to
start off by saying I don't represent the uh FDNY or local 257 um the people
of New York New York City um they're they're suffering because um EMS and um EMS has been um suffering
for a long time because you know they have a very high attration rate we um
taking a very long time to respond to jobs you know New York City is um failing us and the residents of the city
we we don't save property we don't stop crime we save lives it's an important job and in order to do the job
effectively we need more ambulances and personnel we are not responding to jobs on time because of a growing population
bike lanes increased traffic and a high turnover rate of personnel we constantly pump out new academy classes with new
EMTs that are gaining experience they learn the streets and perfect their patient care which takes years what
typically happens once they perfect their craft they end up leaving for better jobs and opportunities where they
will make better wages and better work conditions i am asking city council to
place the 50 million back in the budget as well as the 1 million for mental health for a stronger workforce that
will benefit the people of New York City thank you i agree there should be no uh
secondass first responders in the city we the the speaker certainly and the council believes that the uh city the
mayor should give EMS workers pay parody with other first responders so we're with you thank you yes and thank you
can I just add that uh I'd like my comments to be associated with the chair's comments in regards to
all of the testimony so far
thank you all very much okay our next
panel we have Lisa uh Shigersdorf Juval Scott Pali Basat
should we start hi um I'm Lisa Shriasor i'm the
executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services um we are representing all the public defenders um in New York City
today some of whom are here and some of who could not make it um we did want to
take this opportunity to um talk a little more about our overall budgets for the city for our work i know you
asked some questions during the MACJ portion so you're aware that um after our testimony at the preliminaries we
have done a lot of advocacy to uh get more money from the mayor's office and we're really glad to hear that they did
allocate $20 more million so I just wanted to clarify there are some
concerns with the way that that money needs to be spent but I feel like we probably can work that out um but I just
wanted to make sure that this is Excuse me this I just walked in do you mind give me a little water
um I just wanted to make sure that the city council is aware that our ask that
we really feel we need is probably another hund00 million or close to that and the reason is that we've been saying
for many many years that we need to match salaries of our staff to other
cities that are equivalent to New York such as LA and even some counties
upstate uh where people are being paid quite a bit more money that they can live in their you know home locations
and do their work in the places where they're serving people um and we're unable to do that at this point and in
order to meet those salaries what is currently about an $85,000 starting salary at all of our offices you know
they're all a little different but roughly really needs to be bumped up to about $100,000 because students are
coming out of law school they have large student debts the housing market in New
York is prohibitive and we are losing people we are losing a lot of people it is hard harder and harder to retain
people especially out around the third year so u we've done some computation again we can't be totally sure what it
would cost but we really believe that somewhere between I would say about $und00 million
more than the 20 that they gave us so we'll make very very good use of this but I we really are asking finance and
you know the city council in general to really try to negotiate for a little more money into our budget um you know
for the coming year but one of the issues where I think it's an important piece we're in an extension year where
we've had a contract for six years and all right it's good to have this little bit of extra money but um and I don't
want to poo poo $20 million sounds like a lot but it's you know it's not a huge amount for us but um we're worried that
when we go into the RFP year that if it's really really underfunded it's very hard to do proposals and to expect the
city to properly fund that project you know after the RFP comes in so it is
very important in this coming year for our baseline to go up a bit and maybe even in the following year so we
appreciate your attention and time and consideration thank you
hi good afternoon and uh thank you for making time for Oops can you hear me now thank you
good afternoon and thank you for making time for this panel my name is Juvul Scott and I have the privilege of leading the Bronx Defenders which as I'm
sure you know is located in the poorest congressional district in the country our office employs a holistic model and
there have been studies that demonstrate that the use of our model has been proven to lower rates of mass
incarceration through shortened sentences reduced incarceration rates um
and reduced pre-trial detention a study showed that our work has saved New Yorkers $165 million over 10 years and
more since then and we did that without harming public safety and that says nothing of
the cascading social and economic benefits of keeping people out of jail in their homes and with their families
and employed at the Bronx Defenders we're fortunate to attract some of this country's top talent to serve the 20,000
people per year who rely on our services and they've committed their their talent
to public service in one of the most expensive cities in the country being a public defender especially in this
moment it can be grueling the case loads rarely ease up the hours can be long the
emotional weight can be heavy and these are in combination with the soaring cost of living in the New York City area for
many who would love to choose a path in public defense or have a long career in public defense the pay is a barrier our
clients need my people focused on the people we served and not on whether they
can afford increased rents increased food costs and transportation because our pay remains
historically low and fails to keep pace with the rate of inflation public defender talent should be
properly valued and compensated and public defender offices can only do that if the city increases its funding for
public defender personnel doing so would demonstrate a true commitment and appreciation for the constitutionally
mandated services we provide on behalf of some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers in March we were here and we
asked the city to increase our personnel funding by 25% we made that we make that
same request today because a commitment to public defense commands more thank you
so I I'm going to be slightly redundant um and also personal my name is Pali Basic i'm the managing director for the
Neighborhood Defender Services of Harlem um and again I want to echo what everyone said really appreciate you know
the council has fought for funding increased funding that has made a difference but I think I want to echo what Lisa said that we do need more um
and the personal piece is I'm new to this role i became a managing director because I could not afford to just be a
public defender i supported my family on my salary we almost lost our home
because we just could not support a family on a public defender salary i'd
rather be in a courtroom than here today i I really would um it is a privilege to be here before before all of you but you
know our public defenders they are working because they are committed to the work um but the city needs we need
support from the city to properly fund their work and honor their commitment um
so and and you know I we have shared time and time again you know we have
staff who are single parents who are supporting their families it takes one
crisis to completely throw off the delicate balance that public defenders
maintain for for for any sort of stability um so again I I we know that
you are our allies and friends in this fight and we just ask that you continue to fight for more funding um I'm going
to completely pivot now to policy um you know last time we were here Council
Member Salam you had asked us about discovery you know we have um you know I
think that we are concerned we hope that the council will continue maintaining the fair and transparent discovery laws
um that we have fought for um and you know there are concerns that there might
be potential push back um to roll back discovery in the city and we just ask
for the council's continued commitment to ensure that the process remains fair um and that is somewhat a little bit
related to what else I'm going to talk about and I I know this is a budget hearing but I think this is important
issue to raise and that is the issue of DATs um and the reason I'm raising this
is because it is actually related to discovery reform and there have been a lot of conversations about discovery
reform dat reform occurred at the same time um which was that the NYPD is
required to issue DA DATs now for certain offenses um they're everything
from public uronation to just sitting taking up space um in the subway um and
yet what we are finding across all the burrows um in some burrows more than
others um and I don't have statistics for you today but we are working on that is that DATs are not being given for
those offenses and instead people are being arrested and being brought to arraignments um and you know this was
again something that we fought hard for because this is an issue that disproportionately affects black and
brown New Yorkers um and it is disproportionately affecting the most poorest of New Yorkers given the level
of offenses um and so we wanted to flag this issue for the council more just to
flag this issue it's an issue we are paying attention to and I think the council should also be paying attention to this issue um and we will continue um
raising again I apologize I don't have the statistics um we are going to be working on that and we will be coming
back to you all with more information for that thank you thank you all very much uh Council Member Brewer
thank I'm sure you'll save uh share that with us and when you get the statistics but are you also having a breakdown
nobody can ask somebody whether they are documented or undocumented at least for
city agencies which is a good thing but I am very nervous about uh individuals who don't have documentation because I
worry about ICE so I'm just wondering if that is also an issue that comes across your desk like okay I'm just that's my
issue so we find the increase in using uh not issuing DACs when they should is
across the board but the impact on people Turn your mic on oh sorry um it
seems to me pretty much across the board that they've reduced the use of DATs
uh beyond like what's even legally required but um there does seem to be a
much more dispionate impact as your right to notice for people who not only are undocumented but even people who
just happen to be immigrants and we've been in situations where um once that person is in jail and they're in that
process from arrest to arraignment um they've contacted other counties who are already cooperating with the with ICE
and maybe finding warrants or what they call IC cards which is sort of a wanted thing and like they've had them come and
pick people up right from arraignments so I do believe it is a tactic in some ways to try to round some people up that
they couldn't otherwise um but I also I think it's also impacting people who are
not in that status at all and you know not only is it horrible for people it
slows down the system and it impacts every single person who's in jail the times go up when you have too many
people in that system and it also impacts our own staffing i I don't want to be totally you know selffocused at
the moment but it is very different to represent somebody who's in jail versus somebody who's not in jail and it just
contributes to the kind of work that our staff will always step up to do um but
that you know is difficult you know for us to continually uh fund with our current
resources thank you thank you very much
okay our next panel we have Ruth
Loenron Kevin Maestrich Maya Kreman Michael
Greco Megan French Marcelen and Haley Nelasco
just give us one second
okay Mike you want to
start how you doing good afternoon everybody uh thank you for letting us speak my name is Michael Greco i'm the
vice president of local 257 we represent the FDNY EMTs paramedics and fire
inspectors uh the reason for me coming today was first of all to uh thank you and address the recommendation of the
$50 million in the budget um I've been coming up my president has been coming up for the past nine years speaking of
the inequities that are going on in EMS and uh a month before COVID started back in
uh March of 20 2020 I stood in front of this council and stated that if the call volume hit 6,000 calls a day that EMS
would be decimated sure enough it proved to be correct we had a call in the National Ambulance Service and we all
saw what CO brought when the city gets hit with so many medical calls we're now at that level now and it seems the mayor
or somebody is not listening to the screams going on we're in contract
negotiations we're getting nowhere uh the fight for pay parody is real and the
suggestion of the influx of money that the council has suggested would not only help but I think they're not looking at
the savings that it would bring we're hiring 600 people a year and we're losing about 550 so we're probably the
only agency over the 10 past 10 years who has hired 150% of their budgeted
headcount um simple math it's cost about $10,000 to train one EMT if you just
look at the uh uniforms and if you just look at the books that's not including salaries at 600 uh a year you're looking
at millions and millions of dollars that's being wasted on training this response times are shooting through the
roof um and we thank the city council but we we ask for even more we we need
the pressure our our service is losing members left and right our training is atrocious when it comes to after they
get out into the field there's no secondary training that comes on so I
once again am here to make the call to you guys um I thank you Justin i know you've been a big advocate of us but uh
I I'm I'm re-energizing the call to help save FDNY EMS thank I'm not I'm not sure
how much you're allowed to divulge but is OLR still refusing to recognize EMS
as a uniform service that is correct it was one of our major demands and they will not offer us the uniform coalition
pattern and they will not move above what the opening offer was day one of
the contract and when the mayor was running for office didn't he promise to get this done day one it's now been
over,200 days thank you thank you thank you
hey hello good afternoon Chair Salam Brandon and Council Member Brewer my name is Haley Nolasco and I'm the senior
director of government relations at the Center for Justice Innovation thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today true safety requires sustained
investment in communitydriven solutions focused on prevention and fair intervention that do not solely rely on
law enforcement we thank the council and the administration for their ongoing support and for the restoration of funding for Project Reset its early
intervention for low-level non-violent offenses we thank you however recent federal funding cuts have impacted us
and continue to threaten critical services particularly those that prevent violence and provide healing and
accountability in the communities we need the most that need them the most we're already feeling the impact in some
programs like our community violence intervention and community neighborhood safety initiative work today I want to
highlight a few examples in need of continued support in the South Bronx we are seeking funding to develop a fully operational Bronx Community Justice
Center where we continue to encounter unfunded opportunities to address community safety needs in the Bronx
other programs such as our rise project as well as the Staten Island and Queens community justice centers offer essential gender-based services to
respond to domestic violence and its intersection with gun violence and also provide alternatives to incarceration we
urge the council to continue investing in programs such as these to ensure that service gaps do not disrupt any
community- based organizations vital support to co-produce public safety across our great city thank you so much
thank you just turn your mic off thank you good
afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to testify today my name is Yurelles Leonardo manager of re-entry
services at Getting Out Staying Out a re-entry and antiviolence program that has served more than 15,000 people over
two decades at GOSO we work directly with 16 to 24 year old young people who
are incarcerated in Riker's Island juvenile facilities people in the community who have been directly
impacted by the criminal justice system and those who are at risk i focus on
developing strategies that empower them to reintegrate successfully overcome
barriers and ultimately build a future free of incarceration and that's why
everyone at GOSO is very grateful for the city council and the city support that allows us to do critical
antiviolence work for participants citywide go cure violence intervention
community- based education mental health job readiness and paid internship programs have reduced violence and led
to better outcomes for the people we serve while gun violence is still a serious problem in our community we are
proud to say that the area in East Harlem that we serve has seen gun violence dropped to the lowest level
since 2019 in GOO's community program 93% of
the young people we serve do not return to jail go responded to increased needs
from court involved and formerly incarcerated youth for treatment of anxiety depression and PS PTSD by
opening an in-house mental health clinic in partnership with the child center that provides robust services including
psychiatric care we created new literacy and STEM programs and a third of our
STEM participants will start college this year we rely on city and state
federal funding as well as foundation and private grants and we and we're able to expand programming in part because of
a federal department of justice community violence intervention and pre prevention initiative multi-year grant
in 2022 however this April we unfortunately received news that our
ongoing grant for the DOJ has been rescended and we lost almost 250,000
that has already been budgeted for this fiscal year antiviolence and core community program we are not the only
organization impacted by DOJ cut antiviolence program around our city lost millions of dollars in funding
while we ensure that our program continues they will be impacted and will need to rely on city funding more than
ever to ensure that all participants who need services can get them thank you
thank you
good afternoon ruth Loenrron i'm the director of the disability justice program at New York Lawyers for the
Public Interest and I'm also a member of Correct Crisis Intervention Today New
York City which has as its sole mission transforming the way New York City
responds to mental health crisis and that's what I'm going to talk about today i'm going to show you in a visual
the problem i've also handed this out to you it is very very stunning bleak
information these are 21 individuals who've been killed at the hands of the
police when the police responded to a mental health crisis this is not
pointing a finger at the police but there is something radically wrong when 21 people end up dead
police are not the right people to respond to a mental health crisis you wouldn't send them to respond to a heart
attack or not to send them to respond to a mental health crisis and we luckily
here in New York have um and and by the way it's not at all
limited to deaths we have serious injuries we have people who are arrested
and involved in the criminal legal system who otherwise wouldn't be we have people who are committed to hospitals
over objection who otherwise wouldn't be so we need to transform this yes there
is an attempt to do something about it by the city to remove police wherever
possible but in fact that program is lacking in many many ways it's the be
heard program you may have seen the report that just came out from the con
New York City controllers's office condemning the program greatly i will just say it has hope if it can be
revised in the ways that I'm setting forth in my written testimony that I'm providing to you i'll just say one two
more quick things please um what's critical is that be heard be available
24/7 it's only open 16 hours a day how can you respond to crisis in that short
amount of time and it is also does not include peers individuals with mental
health crisis lived experience whom we are saying are the best people and the
literature will tell you the best people when trained to do that work and that's
what we're pushing right now for the city council to add peers to that and
there's a budget line of $4.5 million to in fact add peers to programs generally
we want to make sure that that 4.5 million is just the beginning of adding peers individuals with live mental
health experience to the Be Herd program and also following our other recommendations for uh revitalizing the
Be Herd program which is greatly in need of it but certainly for eliminating the police in all but the rarest of
circumstances thank you sorry put me in the corner for a reason
um good afternoon uh thank you so much my name is Megan French Marcelen i am
testifying on behalf of the New York City Alternatives to Incarceration and
Re-entry Coalition and I came here today from Fortunes Castle um which hopefully
many of you have visited um where we met with 16 of New York State's parole
commissioners and they said that as they're making determinations about parole they look at one thing are people
connected to our services because they know if they are that they will be
successful and thriving in community we are public safety we're effective public
safety we're proven public safety and we're evidence-based we provide housing
employment job training substance use treatment mental health treatment a lot of my colleagues are on this panel and
our ask is additional $2.4 million to do this work now I want to put that into a
a bigger picture $2.4 4 million is 10%
of what the DOC allocates for overtime every single month 2.4 million res uh
dollars in additional resources allows these programs to thrive and I'm just going to give a couple examples of of
our statistics 97% of Bronx Connect youth do not have another conviction
three years later Osborne's court mitigation programs saved the city
$162 million in incarceration costs last year and CAS's fact team which works
with serious mental illness um through an ATI program has a
100% non-residetism rate now that is far more uh effective public safety than
Rikers and any other program that the city has so we we look forward to
working with you to expand these services thank you so much
thank you anyone left to testify okay thank you all very much
thank you okay okay our next panel is William
Metting Carolyn Lewis Ree Ramadan Hannah Hannah
Jang Maryanne Caldi and Daphne Thomasilla
you can begin when you're ready thank you thank you thank you Charles um for the opportunity to speak today my name
is William Medina i'm a proud leader of the love of deliverist unidos and organizer with the worker justice
project but more than that I'm a delivery worker i'm someone who rise through the city every day to earn a
living to provide for my family to survive i'm here today not just an advocate but as someone who is living
this reality and I'm speaking to you with outrage frustration and heartbreak
during the pandemic people call us heroes they clap for us thank us for
keeping the city running but now on the New York PD new policy it feels like
we've gone from being heroes to being treated like criminals this new New York
PD policy is targeting delivery worker like me i'm just first two weeks more
than a thousand criminals were handed out to cyclists most of them delivery
workers that means if I'm on my bike I roll through a red light maybe because
I'm rushing to meet the liberty time the app is pressure me to meet i could give
a criminal court summon think about that a criminal summon for a traffic violation that put us into the criminal
justice system many of us for the for the first time no lawyer no support just
fear some workers are scared not even show up in court because of possible
contact with ICE others show up and are told because at administrative errors
they have to come back another day lossing work lossing income and adding more street to our already difficult
lives and what worse this someone said can trigger background checks by the apps causing worker to be deactivated
just like that our only source of income is gone what's happening is not about keeping
the street safer if it were car driver will be treated the same way but they're
not this policy target by riders us and that discrimination is unjust that we
make and mistake were criminalized while cars for more dangerous don't face the
same consequences i'm asking the New York City to stand with us we don't need
criminal criminalization we need real solution we urge you to you're the end
of New York PD criminal summons policy targeting cyclist invest in safe by infrastructure and a strong labor
protection for deliverista hold up delivery companies accountable for the unsafe condition they create thank you
for listening thank you go ahead
can you hear me okay I can hear you thank you um good afternoon my name is Carolyn Lewis i am the vice president of
tribal and law enforcement affairs for the national or national child ID program i'm coming to you because we
have a critical and a a serious case going on throughout the country i'm sorry thank you the um you
know we have over a thousand kids that go missing every day every single day and we don't have you know it's not
being talked about it's not being addressed so if I may I I provided a child ID kit the na the national child
ID program started in 1997 when Amber Hagman went missing that's where the Amber came from and um with um with the
help of our NFL partners Hall of Fame they started this program down in Texas giving out over 25,000 kits these kits
do not go in a database they do not be they are not given to any authorities these are solely for family members to
hold on to these kits in the event that their loved ones go missing and if I may just take a minute just to read a couple
of things so basically that this this kit is a comprehensive for comprehensive
information it allows you to do your own fingerprints has decentralized fingerprint in there it has a three card
stock that you could fill out for yourself your families and you know you can look at it on your own um what we're
asking is that um we're asking for your help to seek to raise a million dollars
for a manufacturing grant which would allow us with this we to to excuse me would allow
us to manufacture more kits to be distributed here in New York now if you match let's say for argument sake you
give us a million dollars the National Child ID will match dollar for dollar which would be $2 million which would be
$650,000 kits that could be distributed throughout the city preferably to our students we are focusing on bringing
this this nationwide is actually global i personally have given out over 450,000
kits nationally nationally and we look forward to continuing this i have given a letter which my my personal
information as well as the executive director's information is on there and hopefully we can get a million dollars
so that we can take care of our kids because basically our their their safety is our f their future is our safety and
um their safety is our duty so thank you for the time
thank you Chair Brandon and Chair Salam and to the committees for holding this hearing and giving us the opportunity to testify my name is Daffy Tamasana i'm
the associate director of programs at the Asian-American Federation where we represent the collective voice of more than 70 member nonprofits serving 1.5
million Asian New Yorkers since 2021 our organization has played a critical role in keeping Asian New Yorkers safe as an
anchor organization of the Partners Against the Hate Forward Initiative also known as the PATH program i'm testifying
today with a few of the other PATH anchor organizations and one of our sub anors in 2025 public safety for Asian
New Yorkers is under threat like never before escalating anti-immigrant policies ICE encroachment on local
authority and ongoing anti-Asian hate have created deep fear especially in immigrant communities as an anchor
organization we provide culturally competent language accessible programming and services that address
hate violence in conjunction with our sub anchors current services are running well as they have been for the past four
years and making changes now while New Yorkers feel heightened fear and anxiety about public safety would get in the way
of past success since the start of the program we've trained over 200 community members in safety techniques provided
over 990 community members with protective presence and accompaniment services and we've recruited over 400
volunteers to provide safety services in Asian majority neighborhoods despite its success our path funding was cut by
$30,000 per anchor for FY26 we respectfully urge the council to restore full funding for path to the anchors and
increase public safety investment to meet community needs and increase funding for antiviolence and immigrant
safety programming like our hope against hate campaign at a time of continued hate violence and rising fear this
reduction in funding jeopardizes vital programs and safety services risk cutting off access to healing and
support for some of the city's most vulnerable residents and contradicts the city and the council stated commitments
to safety equity and wellness for all New Yorkers we've spent many years building infrastructure to provide this
safety programming and the challenges faced by our community to demand long-term investment in public safety thank you for your support and the
opportunity to testify thank you
good afternoon my name is Mariam Khali and I'm the advocacy and civic engagement manager at the ArabAmerican
Association of New York since 2001 AANY has fought against the continued rise of
hate crimes against our communities and in 2021 we joined the Partners Against the Hate Forward initiative under the
Office of the Prevention of Hate Crimes tripleny and our grantees have led hundreds of self-defense trainings
trained thousands of community members in bystander intervention and deescalation tactics provided hate
crimes prevention workshops and resources to thousands of New Yorkers and advocated both on the local and
statewide level for legislation that protects our communities from hate violence one of our grantees Council on
American Islamic Relations New York has been collecting data on hate crimes against Palestinian Arab and Muslim New
Yorkers many of which go unreported to the NYPD and city offices since October
2023 they've received 290 reports of hate crimes or bias incidents against
community members on the basis of their identity as Palestinian Arab or Muslim or for showing pro Palestine solidarity
including 134 from students in the K to2 and university levels at NY we've seen
firsthand the scope and and trauma of this hate violence we've worked with clients whose hijabs were ripped off
mosques that were vandalized with hateful words and much more our organization has also faced hate crimes
including threats of physical violence and our staff has experienced harassment stalking and threats because of our
identities and the work that we do the PATH program allowed us to serve thousands of clients and provide
supports to hundreds of victims of hate despite the program's success each path
anchors funding was cut by 30,000 for FY26 by OPC at a time of hate rising
fear and with a federal administration spewing anti-immigrant hate our services are needed more than ever and so we
asked the NYC council to increase investment in our safety work to meet the needs of our communities that we
serve and the funding be restored for the path path initiative tripleny has been and will continue to be on the
front lines working to combat hate violence promote community safety and we hope that the New York City Council will
continue to support us in doing so thank you thank you very much
peace hello good afternoon my name is Ree i'm the director of community organizing and public advocacy at the
New York City Anti Violence Project AP ap is a direct service and advocacy
organization we serve LGBTQ survivors of violence we have a 247 bilingual hotline
where survivors can access our free counseling and free legal services and
we also engage members with community organizing and leadership development trainings we envision a world where
LGBTQ and HIV affected people are safe and live free from violence and we are
the only LGBTQ specific victim services agency in the city
it was in this very city that the Stonewall uprising happened in 1969 where LGBTQ people have had enough
and made it known that we deserve to have the same level of safety as everyone else while that sounds like a
distant time it is unfortunate that the fight must still go on to this day LGBTQ
people experience hate violence at a higher rate than our straight and cisgender counterparts and because LGBTQ
identity lives at the intersection imagine the compounded violence that a person experiences if they are bipok if
they are immigrants if they are houseless and if they are formerly incarcerated especially now with the
current federal administration LGBTQ people are a target of harmful policies
the roll back of federal protections against discrimination in health care and education targeting trans people and
their access to gender affirming care and even legislation that bans LGBTQI
inclusive curricula in schools if there is any respit in this it's that we're in
New York that the very place that the Stonewall uprising started and we must
honor that legacy we call on you members of the city council thank you for being here for hearing us and we and we call
for your support let's make it known that New York City doesn't have a place for hate or harmful policies and let us
put those words into practice as another anchor or of the path forward initiative
we ask to increase the funding to ensure that the anchor orgs uh get their
funding restored by the 30k that was cut and to increase the hate violence prevention initiative to support the
organizations working with the communities most vulnerable to violence and to reallocate funding from law
enforcement agencies to community- based organizations that offer culturally competent services that speak their
language and that offer lifesaving services and to invest in community safety education healthcare and housing
for all thank you
thank you to Tier Brennan and Chair Salam and the committees on public safety and finance for the opportunity to testify today my name is Hannah Jeng
and I serve as a community outreach advocate for the Korean-American Family Service Center for over 35 years KFSC
has supported immigrant survivors of gender- based violence offering safety healing and hope through culturally
culturally and linguistically accessible services at KFSC we see firsthand how domestic violence sexual violence child
abuse and AAPI hate harms physical and mental health in our community our
clients primarily Korean and other Asian immigrant women often face violence isolation shame and fear when seeking
help as a leader in seeking to end violence of all kinds KFSC has joined the Partners Against the Hate Forward
initiative to keep New Yorkers safe i'm testifying today to both acknowledge the current investment in the city has made
in hate violence prevention and to also ask for increased investment in public safety the PATH program has allowed us
to create safely programming responsive to community needs respond quickly to crisises with wraparound case management
and connections to long-term mental health services offer community workshops to educate community members
on how to keep themselves safe during times of violence and more we provided hundreds of safety resources to
community members engaged nearly 100 volunteers in trainings and safety events and conducted 15 inerson events
through this program kfsc respectfully urges the city council to invest in community-based organizations that
deliver culturally and linguistically competent services for immigrant families and to increase funding for
initiatives that directly support AAPI communities and broader community safety
specifically we ask that you invest in the hate crime prevention initiative which supports community-led efforts to
address trauma and bias fueled violence and restore full funding for PATH sustain and expand funding for the

K4207 i've been stalk since May 11 2006 i reached out to the wonderful Salam sir
Salam last year reached out to many wonderful people to no avail i lost 19
years of my life if you dare to spend one day following me it's pretty scary i don't go out
anymore uh the wonderful Jessica Tish that was here with with what's his name matt Frasier the one here was it Siana k
I N S E L L yeah all these wonderful people get the same email
wilds W I L E S and Levit the White House Pam Bondi DOJ Stacy Lynch 15 plus

underneath me I have sore ears now very sore ears and there's not a part of my
body that's not in pain and And I have a lump here i have a whole issue of things
that went to the mayor to the governor but most of all that man who read 10

5,000 plus letters have gone to the White House and every bus and train camera i just sat here today as you
notice and not move as everyone crept around me i had to behave myself and allow it cuz I can't do anything about
it mr jennings I've been asked y'all for help from the days of what's his name raymond
Diaz bronxboro president yeah to now nothing the wonderful Jessica Tish thank
you very much constance
my name is Constance Leold and I'm not officially representing anyone today but
um as you know from my prior testimony
um Chairman Brandon um I'm very involved
with senior citizens centers and Um I would have hoped to have with me my
partner at 966 uh Grace Hairgood uh Senior Center of of the Fort Green Group
uh because we had uh begged for help from the Department of Transportation in
regard to the ebike and the bicycles and the motorcycles and everything else issues
um and uh we didn't get any answer from the department of transportation uh but
I do have to say that uh the uh problems have uh somewhat it would appear to the
this pedestrian um and others have improved over the
last years so uh I have to look at
Jessica Tish's testimony seriously um I I am very sympathetic
uh to the community that is faced with
um ICE threats and in some ways that includes all of us uh I just got a
request last night to help a church in Newberg New York uh where I uh went into
a uh service without notice and took out
six people uh that church is hoping to organize churches uh I just say this
because I am very involved um with a lot of issues around ICE and I am
sympathetic but I am not sympathetic to the idea that documented
or undocumented workers uh have the right to go through a red
light and endanger the lives of the pedestrians um no everybody has to go by
the laws and if it t and if there is no
consequences when they don't [Music] um we don't get any improvement i I I
just have to say that uh the fair evasion issue the
uh the transit authority is charging too much for the city and whatever you can
do on these issues um within the budgetary way uh do it and
and with the Franklin Avenue shuttle please uh look at the issues of graffiti
uh where the great artwork is uh being uh damaged by I am told by the police
white troublemakers and um they have faced no
consequences um the assembly person has taken the artwork down and um Thank you
very much yeah it's just that um they came right back again uh so that the
police are not um they are not protecting our precious
artwork at Franklin and Fulton that we all work so very hard for thank you
thank you very much ladies
Liza go ahead oh there you go okay thank you um thank
you so much chairs uh Ysef Salam and Justin Brennan for the opportunity to speak my name is Liha Walpa i represent
the Workers Justice Project in Losista and today I'm here to call out
and condemn the new NYPD reason policy that targets cyclists particularly
delivery workers with criminal summons for traffic violations let let's absolutely be clear this policy is not
about public safety is about criminalizing immigrant workers the people who actually feed and keep every
New Yorker safe this crackdown is not is is not just shameful it's outrageous and
dangerous it sends a clear message that our city will rather punish workingclass people rather than holding accountable
multi-billion dollar corporations like Uber Door Dash GrubHub companies that have created a system
where workers are forced to deliver faster take her more risks and put their own safety on the line in order to avoid
being deactivated or losing their own their income that they have today I heard NYPD commissioner claim that
criminal that civil summons uh were not too harsh enough and that in the name of
public safety criminalizing delivery workers and cyclists is ultimately necessary that's outrageous and that's a
lie let me be clear and let me share with you delivery workers have always been a
target of excessive traffic enforcement this has already cost thousands of dollars in civil summons to delivery
workers hitting where it hurts the most their pockets their family income so
this enformentment this this now turning this criminal summons in this civil summons into criminal enforcement it's
painful and the idea that criminalizing on the name of his of of public safety
it's um it's a complete lie and here I am asking to you for your support we
need to condemn these type of policies and really address the roots of the core issues what workers really need is
protected bike lanes safe and accessible bike parking designated delivery zones
so they don't have to be blocking traffic or uh being in the pedestrian areas battery swap charging stations and
a community center approach that is not about criminalizing but educating protecting workers from the algorithm
systems that are exploiting our own people and hardworking New Yorkers we look forward to working with you joining
forces to uh calling out to the end of these harmful policies and building real
solutions that is about caring for the people that care with that care for
every New Yorker during the pandemic instead of treating them as criminals
thank you i'll go uh hello chairs brandon chairs salam my name is Christopher Leon Johnson and I'm here to
support the deliveristas um I'm here to support these two nonprofits here a shout out to the street bender project for giving me this pen at the small
business fair and the workers project giving me this pen at the fair too all right so I want to make this clear that
look this these um policies that t um just tish has done on behalf of her mother is really racist and
discriminatory against theistas what this does is put these guys and gals in danger with immigration because a lot of
you guys don't have papers and all it's going to do is open them up to ICE and I'm calling to the city council to make
a statement with all the members that really care about these deliveries on this in the situation to really condemn
um Jessica Tish for what she's doing on behalf of her mother she's not doing this on behalf of street safety because
if it was for street safety it would be for everybody but she's doing this on behalf because her mother complained so I'm calling on the city council to
really condemn Jessica Tish for doing this to to these um the resisters i am calling on the city council to um find a
way to demolish that new stand right outside city hall and install that deliverista hub on behalf of the work
justice project why are you not guys not doing this yet for i I don't get what's going on here at the same time I'm
calling under the city council to make sure that the work justice project and the street project still keep their
funding in the FY26 cycle because there's a lot of internal stuff that's going on and I believe they should keep
they should still keep their funding for what they do for the city of New York um and another thing is that um tomorrow at
6:00 at Union Square there's going to be a critical mass bike ride down the down from Union Square to City Hall and I
hope that you Mr justin Brandon show up or send one your stat to show up and show you in solidarity to the theistas
that are getting harassed by the NYPD and one more thing is that we need to abolish Cop City for the FY27 cycle we
need to find with the ball cop city because the deliveristas and the street vendors are being are going to be
harassed more with the help of the NYPD and another thing is that um we have to
stand with our deliveristas we have to stand with uh all the resistance in the city they shouldn't be discriminated
because they run a bike down the street they're essential workers i know i know i know you had to go they're essential workers they deliver pills they deliver
medicine i have family my that's sick and I don't want anybody even my worst enemy to not be able to get medicine
because theista get arrested because they don't some don't know the language barrier or the um and some might resist
and they might be the oh why I can't get my pills because the person that deliver my pills got arrested by the NYPD so
thank you so much thank you thank you sir right
thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify to the city council especially to council member Justin
Brennan who has been present at the last three testimonials that I've made here in the month of
May uh Commissioner Tish and the NYPD testimonials today while explaining
all of the efforts to combat reductions in crime i don't feel are being assessed
accurately by this council or by the NYPD or other municipal agencies
including the Department of Inspection Internal Affairs Bureau Department of Homeless Services Department of Social
Services HA Health and Hospitals and even the Social Security
Administration and other federal agencies including the DOJ FBI and CIA
in the month of May alone I have been targeted as a victim of crime experiencing both physical and sexual
assaults on the streets of New York with no official resolution by the NYPD or
other agencies namely the DOI and the IAB or even agencies like the CCB
these assaults were particularly violent on one occasion as I mentioned just the other day a young college-age person
kicked a MTA glass partition uh glass
repeatedly with the objective of shattering it which I believe is a form of biochemical terrorism as far as the
safest Memorial Day in terms of zero shootings uh a criminal doesn't need a gun to kill someone i was physically
assaulted in broad daylight at 17 State Street outside of a building where I used to be employed again as I mentioned
as a CCR agent for a company called Shareholder Communications from 1995 1998 and 2001 where I witnessed the
attacks at the World Trade Center on 911 i reported this assault from Memorial
Day to the first precinct i was told by an officer um who uh did not and they
did not officially take the incident report i was told and asked by the
officer at the first precinct whether I called 911 after the incidents i believe this
is ridiculous and absurd the budget hearing is on what the NYPD policies are
doing to combat crime in NYC and specifically Commissioner Tish and the NYPD and their affiliates should go over
and beyond this meeting to have a sincere and factual account of what
measures are being taken to ensure the safety of lawabiding American citizens
thank you very much thank you okay our next panel thank you
thank you all we have Adriana Rivera and David
Cook after this you have like one more
thank you bro see you tomorrow okay good luck thank you
thank you city council for having us speak today my name is Lieutenant Adriana Rivera i'm an EMT and training
officer i also work for an organization called Emergency Medical Service Public Advocacy Council EMS PAC that strives
for the ideal of pay parity and proper mental health support for EMTs i'm also the mother of a 10-year-old EMT junior
who I'm very proud of um I am the chief of the EMS PAC's peer mentor support
hardship help division open to all members of service whether private or volunteer alike i come here today to
speak on behalf of EMS workers in the service over the last few years emergency call volume has increased
tremendously emts are expected to perform at their very best every second of their shift these individuals are
exposed to the worst of what the city has to offer but are the best people in our city they deal with mass casualty
incidents severe domestic violence situations child abuse miscarriages gunshot and stab victims grandparents
dead on arrival overdoses are expected murder and suicides are typical dead
baby today rape victim tomorrow this is their norm i apologize if this sounds blunt to you but I only describe what it
takes to be an emergency medical service worker out in the field they arrive to the same calls that police do without
proper med uh safety equipment willing to put themselves at risk they are assaulted spit on and degraded this is
their daily grind upward 40 hours a week day in day out they do this all on minimal pay over the last 20 years the
starting pay has only increased by $4.69 for the fire department EMT workers this is certainly not a living
wage uh these people have families to support and they're trying to pay their way through school the percentage of
call volume has increased astronomically over the past few years while the pay has certainly lagged behind the rate of
suicide among first responders has seen an uptick certainly increasing during the pan pandemic and hasn't slowed since
there's an unfortunate stigma to seeking mental health help members are afraid that they will be put on restricted
duties or feel ostracized from their cohorts i hope that you take into consideration my testimony and the
testimony of my pre my peers i pray that the city council votes yes to increase wages which will encourage neighboring
EMS services to fall in line and yes to funding mental health resources for EMS workers thank you for your time
thank you great job great job
first off I want to say uh good afternoon to everybody in this room room i hope everybody has a good day and I also want to just give thanks to God and
thank thanks to Jesus Christ uh I want to thank you guys for hearing my testimony and my comrade my name is
David Cook i'm a lieutenant with the fire department New York City EMS i worked 17 years with the fire department
and to be honest with you I really deserve more than two minutes because I put my life on the line saving every person in New York City every burrow
non-stop doing countless countless hours of overtime you see I'm a paramedic and I'm also a former paramedic instructor
which means I trained a lot of young EMTs and paramedics to do great field work in the streets you see Michael
Fineran was one of my instructors and he called he called me when I was a young EMT 21-year-old kid on the job superhero
and I I learned very quickly that every superhero and I'm going to use Superman as the uh analogy that even Superman
deserves to go home to Lois Lane and um can be Clark Clint Clark Kent and
live live his life normal and that goes for every man and women in the fire department EMS the pay is so low
everybody's doing countless overtime you have mothers struggling by themselves they're struggling by themselves taking
care of one two three four five kids we need you guys to vote on money listen how do you want the superheroes to save
the firemen the police officers when they go in dangerous buildings who's who you think's going to save them the paramedics and EMTs i'm speaking for
everybody i'm also vice president of operations of a nonprofit organization called EMS Pack we have about 12,000
followers and we educate the public and all we promote is pay parody so yeah we need everybody to stop saying you're
going to do something actually do something i testified here in 2020 right here that says New York's
best when I got this jacket done it says New York best that's that's what FDNY
EMS is so I want to figure out why we got to sit here and negotiate and waste time on when to pay us let's cut let's
cut the nonsense and Mayor Adams made promises he didn't live up to it a lot of these politicians been in office
didn't live up to it so I'm tired of the games and the truth is all of the EMTs and paramedics are struggling you have
men suffering through mental health they're paying child support they're struggling to take care of their kids i'm going to keep going i deserve that i
earned that i sit there and intubate patients when they go into cardiac arrest i stick IVs in patients arms and
give them medication i I bring the dead back to life in New York City you're going to hear me when I
talk that's a fact i speak for all the EMTs and paramedics you're going to respect me that's a
fact i got the internal affairs in the fire department chasing EMTs and paramedics out of bathrooms and taking
their money for nonsense and FDNY EMS fdny EMS dictates when the privates
and hospital 911 are going to get their salary increased so if you don't increase the EMTs and paramedic salary in the fire department the rest of them
got to suffer so who's going to have the kahunas to do what they got to do i got to keep coming back
here my name's David Jesse Cook thank
you thank you
thank you all for Thank you all thank Thanks to all of you for your testimony
today and sharing your thoughts and experience if there's anyone in the chamber who wishes to speak but has not
yet had the opportunity to do so please raise your hand and fill out an appearance card with the
sergeant-at-arms at the back of the room seeing no hands in the chamber we will
now shift to online testimony via
Zoom we will now call Johnny Gileiam you
may begin
hi i'm sorry can you folks hear me okay yes great um good afternoon Chair Salam
and the members of the committee on public safety my name is Johnny Gillum i am a um parallegal at the New York City
Antiolence Project AVP you heard from my colleague earlier so I will try to just speak from the legal perspective um and
avoid duplication my written testimony does go into considerably more detail than I'll be able to here and I
encourage all of you to read it now you folks don't need me to tell you that the LGBTQ community that we serve which
includes immigrants black and brown folks sex workers and queer New Yorkers of all descriptions is under direct
legal attack from the federal government um small community organizations like ours are likewise targeted we at AP have
been defunded nearly half a million dollars in federal grants um and we expect to lose considerably more that's
a lot of money for a small organization like ours um we don't know if we're going to be able to survive in a budgetary perspective and so for this
reason we ask that the council increase funding to vulnerable legal organizations like our own um and also encourage mock to do the same we at AP
Legal represent clients at all levels of the criminal justice system our clients are often undocumented or sex workers or
both and they tend to move between the traditional roles of victim and perpetrator within the criminal justice system we strive to provide those
clients with holistic and culturally competent representation that other folks would not be able to we do crime
victims advocacy criminal defendant advocacy immigration representation etc to give you an example I want to briefly
introduce Isabella who is a client of ours she's a trans woman from Guatemala a victim of trafficking um she is now
subject to the racist and unconstitutional lake and Riley Act so if she were picked up by ICE today she
would be sumearily deported without um any right to representation when we first started working with her we were
doing defense advocacy um then we moved into deportation defense and we're now doing crime victims advocacy for her
trying to get her out of her trafficking situation um and we're working with city agencies to do that and that's just kind
of a brief example of the really holistic um representation that we're able to provide thank you for your
testimony time has expired thank you
thank you we are now making a final call for any person who is on Zoom who has
not yet spoken if you're currently on Zoom and wish to speak but have not yet had the opportunity to do so please use
the raise hand function and our staff will unmute unmute
