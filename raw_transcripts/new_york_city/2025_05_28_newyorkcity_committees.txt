Congress for decades i was honored to know him his legacy will continue to
live on in our city and within all of us who were influenced by him i also want to acknowledge the
unimaginable tragedy that took place last Wednesday when Yuron Lashinski and
Sarah Mgram two workers at the Israeli embassy were killed in a horrific anti-semitic attack no one should be the
target of violence due to their religion background or beliefs and our Jewish
community like all communities deserve to be safe we must continue to work
together to root out anti-semitism in all forms of hate my heart and prayers
are with Iran and Sarah's families and communities who must now carry the unbearable weight of their
losses earlier this month our city lost members of our own workforce anthony

ones who are grieving today this week is the final week of our

outstanding funding gaps and heard from New Yorkers across the city who rely on adequate city services to safely and
successfully continue living in our city we must continue we must ensure that New
York City is a place where all our fellow neighbors regardless of income background or experience build healthy

much for your attention now I will turn it back over to our majority leader thank you Speaker Adams uh we have a

to leave the chamber floor additionally no member virtually can participate if quorum is not maintained on the floor we
will now move into the discussion of general orders i'd like to first recognize council member Kaban followed
by Williams and Hudson
thank you never been called first majority leader caught me off guard
um I I want to talk about uh the intro 1148 the Receipts Act this legislation
marks an important step toward greater transparency accountability and trust in our city's public benefits system
the Receipts Act ensures that applicants for key benefits like cash assistance oneshot deals and food stamps receive an
application confirmation notice when they apply this notice will indicate whether the application is complete and
if not what steps remain it also requires that applicants receive a detailed receipt after submitting
documents including the date type of documents and the purpose of submission these may seem like minor procedural
updates but for those seeking vital support they can mean the difference between clarity and confusion between
getting help and falling through the cracks for too long navigating public benefits has been a frustrating and
opaque process have often left without
documentation of their status and this bill tackles that issue with clear common sense solutions and it was crafted to serve and uplift New Yorkers
by my constituent services director Melissa Korea so shout out to her uh and my legislative director Jonah Burch uh
and also thank you to all of the constituent service teams uh in all of my colleagues offices chronic
underfunding and understaffing at agencies like DSS have left too many New Yorkers struggling to access life-saving
services during times of need the Receipts Act is about restoring dignity to a system that has left many feeling
powerless it ensures people have the tools to advocate for themselves and ensures that the government serves New Yorkers better i thank the advocate
service providers and New Yorkers who share their stories and made clear how urgently this change was needed um and I
look forward to working with DSS and H to implement this legislation effectively and thoughtfully together we
can ensure the Receipts Act fulfills its promise a benefit system that better serves the people so thank you again to
my colleagues for supporting this vital measure recognizing Council Member Williams followed by Hudson the nurse
thank you so much Madam Majority Leader for decades home owners in Southeast Queens have lived with the consequences
of a problem most New Yorkers have never heard of groundwater flooding this issue
began decades ago as changes to the area's natural water table followed the closure of local wells and shifts in
landmines unlike storm driven flooding groundwater flooding happens slowly and
silently damaging basements boilers and foundations without warning it's a
problem my constituents of Southeast Queens know all too well intro 1067B
brings much needed focus and coordination to an issue that has gone unressed for far too long it ensures the
city is collecting data paying attention to the patterns and beginning to understand the full scope of groundwater
flooding across all five burrows and for southeast Queens where residents have dealt with this quietly for years 1067b
creates a path forward toward coordinating long-term solutions this includes the creation of a dedicated
task force charged with centering the lived experiences of Southeast Queens residents and recommending practical
strategies for adaptation and relief and for all New Yorkers this bill will help
guide smarter more informed planning and investments across our city this is what
responsive community rooted government looks like i really want to thank Speaker Adrienne Adams uh who also
represents Southeast Queens uh for her leadership and my council colleagues especially chair Jim Janeiro who has
been a long advocate on groundwater flooding in Southeast Queens for standing with us and every New Yorker
with the quiet crisis of groundwater flooding and I really want to just give a special shout out to the legislative
division Natasha and Andrew uh because they worked really hard to make this a
bill that we can legally pass it's very difficult and complicated so I really want to thank them for their dedication
to bringing this across the finish line thank you
recognizing Council Member Hudson followed by nurse then Oay good afternoon and thank you Madam Majority
Leader i'm proud to stand today and speak for no more than two minutes about the Atlantic Avenue mixeduse plan also
known as AMUP that we're voting on today it's the culmination of more than a decade of advocacy from local residents
and nearly three years of public engagement hard work and tireless negotiations central Brooklyn is finally
getting the community-led resoning it has long demanded aimup will bring 4,600
new homes to central Brooklyn 40% of which will be affordable for low and moderate income New Yorkers along with
more than 215 million in dedicated funding for infrastructure upgrades park
and playground renovations funding for local hiring programs as well as resources for tenant and homeowner
protections and so much more for our communities with this community-led resoning we're tackling several major
crises facing our city a housing shortage dangerous streets and the urgent need for good paying jobs
accessible to all New Yorkers regardless of education level this process shows what's possible when planning is led by
the community and backed by political will we can build more affordable housing and deliver real lasting
benefits to neighborhoods across the city thank you to the communities of Prospect Heights Crown Heights Fort
Green Clinton Hill and Bedford Stson for envisioning a better future for Atlantic Avenue and to the many city agencies and
council staff who worked tirelessly to get us here and of course a huge thank you to my partner in this work Council
Member Chio who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with me throughout this process and whose relentless advocacy and steadfast leadership help
us across the finish line i've also made my Chio video debut so if you haven't seen it yet go check it out i urge my
colleagues to vote yes on AMUP and that I hope and I hope that more communities across the city begin the deep consensus
building work needed to bring about more affordable housing safer streets better parks and stronger neighborhoods thank
you recognizing Council Member Nurse
followed by Oay thank you majority leader i too have had
a Chio video debut um uh today we are voting on my bill
intro 1037 the rent transparency act the bill will require signage in the common
areas of all buildings subject to the rent stabilization law that notifies tenants that one or more units in the
building are rent stabilized the sign will direct them to the New York State Department of Homes and Community
Renewal website where they can request their rental history the bill also alerts tenants that their landlords may
be subject to fines if they do not register their units with DHCR many tenants living in rent stabilized units
don't know how to determine their legal rent and in turn bad landlords have gotten away with illegal rent
overcharges and have illegally deregulated units and whole buildings the Rent Transparency Act acts as a
counter to this information gap and makes it clear that landlords with apartment units that are out of compliance can face fines rent
overcharge complaints have increased from 500 annually just a few years ago to over 900 last year and this is just
from tenants who took action there are probably thousands who didn't and as we continue to lose New Yorkers to the
astounding cost of living rising rents remain a top concern for millions of New Yorkers let's help relieve just some of
the burden on tenants by giving them some clarity and passing the Rent Transparency Act thank you to Ryan
Hickey Patricia Santana Elliot Elliot Heisler Austin Malone and the housing legal services providers colleagues I
ask you for your vote in favor of this bill thank you Majority Leader recognizing Council Member Oce today we
are voting on a plan that meets the urgency of the moment the Atlantic Avenue mixeduse plan Aimup will unlock
4,600 new homes across community districts 3 and 8 and 1,900 of them will
be incomerestricted that's a large and necessary amount of new homes and more incomerestricted housing than this than
this area has produced in the entire last decades through AUP 40% of units will be permanently incomerestricted and
100% will be adding to New York's desperately low housing supply putting downward pressure on rents for everyone
behind beyond the necessary homes this plan unlocks we have secured historic neighborhood investment $215 million for
safer streets enhanced infrastructure and vibrant parks this includes long needed improvements to St andrews John
Hancock and PTOAC playgrounds we are redesigning the stretch of Atlantic so kids can cross in safety seniors can
stroll without fear and small businesses can flourish along a calmer greener corridor additionally after 30 long
years we are going to address the homeownership and ownership issues surrounding Hattie Jones Court and Juel
McCoy Lane this is the first step to bringing key repairs and improvements to the streets and because housing justice
includes looking out for everyone we locked in $1.2 2 million for full-time tenant and homeowner legal assistance
right in our district offices plus citywide resources like partners in preservation and the anti-harassment
tenant program so no one can bully our neighbors out of their homes some will ask why build so much my answer is
simple displacement is not a force of nature it is a policy choice when we deprive our city of new homes rents
skyrocket and families are pushed out when we say yes to new homes to income restricted homes to making room for
everyone so no one is priced out we choose community over scarcity and inclusion over exclusion this plan also
invests in a workforce development program so the jobs of tomorrow go to the people who live here today it even
begins the long-awaited revival of the Bedford Atlantic Armory with AMUP we prove that Brooklyn's future can be
abundant equitable prosperous alive and ours i thank our council's land use team
for shephering us through endless negotiations and reviews the department of city planning and other agencies for
taking our community's feedback seriously and to our neighbors who helped us shape this plan and emp
emphasize the need for real affordable housing in the district thank you thank you council member Hudson my amazing staff May Verang Batana Elijah
Fox as well as the speaker thank you very much seeing no one else signed up to speak

pleased with the home rules or state legislative resolutions that we're passing today uh especially
SLR2 which will ensure that our streets finally get cleaned up uh the automating
enforcement by the department of sanitation will ensure that cars actually move for alternate side parking
um when street sweepers uh you know go around our communities they pick up a
ton of garbage on average per route but they can't clean up our streets if they can't reach the curb which then leads to
more garbage which leads to more rats which undermines our quality of life this is a smart uh and effective use of

368 in support of the living wage for musicians act on today's agenda i'd also
like to thank council members O Rivera Menan Kaban for introducing this
resolution alongside me and chairs Delarosa and Lewis for seeing the bill
through committee most of us myself included use streaming platforms as our
primary way of listening to so music the songs that we stream soundtrack our
lives but the popularity of music streaming platforms has not benefited the artists that make the songs we
listen to currently the average recording artist receives less than a third of a penny when someone streams
their song on Spotify these low rates of pay make it incredibly difficult for musicians to ek out a living we all know
that New York City makes the best music in the entire world if we want to keep it that way we have to make sure
musicians can make enough money to live here the living wage

nay any abstensions the eyes have it we will now
move into general discussion and I'd like to first recognize Majority Whip Brooks Powers followed by Council Member
Lewis Venowitz thank you and today I'm introducing two important pieces of
legislation first I'm introducing a bill that would require the city to conduct a
re recurring environmental impact study of JFK airport operations in southeast
Queens for far too long residents in communities like mine have lived with the daily impacts of noise and air
pollution from airport traffic without adequate monitoring transparency or
mitigation this bill directs the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to work with city agencies to collect
data on Sergeants please hold the time folks that are leaving the chambers please do so
quietly you can continue this bill directs the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to
work with city agencies to collect data on air quality noise and health outcomes
consult with local environmental justice groups and publish regular public reports it also requires the city to
recommend and implement programs that reduce environmental harm and to engage the Port Authority on needed changes to
the JFK lease agreement if we are serious about environmental justice we
must back that up with data and action this legislation ensures that environmental concerns in Southeast
Queens are taken seriously i'm also proud to introduce a resolution in support of two critical state bills
senate Bill 1244 Assembly Bill 1587 and Senate Bill
7275A in the assembly bill accompanying that is 5341A which would strengthen sighting
rules for cannabis storefronts and advertising these bills would increase the minimum distance between cannabis
businesses and sensitive sites like schools playgrounds libraries and houses of worship while also clarifying how
those distances are measured we must ensure legis legalization does not come
at the expense of the community well-being i urge the state legislature to pass these bills and the governor to
sign them into law thank you recognizing Council Member Lewis followed by Denowitz the
nurse thank you Madam Majority Leader today I'm proud to introduce three important pieces of legislation each of
which reflect on commitment to equity transparency and accessibility for all New Yorkers the first resol calls on the
state and governor to pass legislation that would require employers to disclose all forms of compensation including
bonuses stock options and commissions while salary transparency laws have moved us in the right direction too many
workers are still left negotiating in the dark employees deserve to understand the full scope of what they are being
offered without clear information on total compensation workers especially women of color and people of color
remain at a disadvantage when negotiating pay full transparency is essential to achieving real pay equity
the second intro 1286 addresses the responsible placement of adult use
cannabis dispensaries it would prohibit any dispensary from operating within 500 ft of a public youth facility as the
legal cannabis market continues to grow it is important that we implement thoughtful regulations that consider the
needs of young people the last intro 1287 part of the Wheel Deal package in
partnership with Council Member Marte requires the current bike share program to offer a discounted rate to public
school students who are 16 years of age or older for many young people bike share programs provide a critical link
to school work and other opportunities by removing financial barriers we are helping students move more freely
through the city and encouraging sustainable healthy modes of transportation each of these bills address a different challenge New
Yorkers are experiencing i urge my colleagues to support these bills and to help move our city forward thank you
recognizing Council Member Denowitz followed by nurse then Ables thank you Madam Majority Leader uh good afternoon
colleagues today I'm introducing Bill 1281 of 2025 a bill that addresses
really an urgent financial matter facing countless tenants and shareholders our
constituents and I'm proud to stand with council members Botcher and Holder Holden in support of this measure uh
this legislation 1281 amends local law 157 of 2016 which mandates natural gas
detectors in hotels and residential buildings the Department of Buildings set a compliance deadline of May 1st
which is obviously passed and the intent of local law 157 is sound it's to protect residents from gas leaks but
this May 1 deadline is utterly unachievable yet despite this
unachievable deadline the fines for New Yorkers our constituents will begin to
mount 18 of us even outlined some of these these obstacles in our April letter uh to the Department of Buildings
Commissioner uh the market lacks compliant devices they do not exist our
law requires detectors to meet NFPA standard 715 of 2023 only one
manufacturer has produced a compliant device however this company has faced crippling supply chain issues preventing
timely orders worse the sole compliant device has been massively recalled due
to a critical malfunction that prevents it from alerting consumers to gas leaks
the one otherwise viable option is now off the shelves and even if devices uh were available compliant installation of
plug-in models is often impossible in New York City apartments they're required to be 3 to 10 feet horizontally
of an appliance and within 12 in of a ceiling and most of us don't have outlets near the ceiling the consequence
is clear new Yorkers will be unjustly fined for failing to meet a mandate that is quite literally impossible to fill
this bill 1281 simply postpones the mandate requiring alarms one year after the Department of Buildings confirms
devices are sufficiently available i encourage everyone to join us in co-sponsoring this common sense bill
1281 to shield New Yorkers from our unwarranted fines and to ensure true safety remains our paramount goal thank
you Madam Majority Leader recognizing Council Member Nurse followed by Azen Gutierrez
thank you Majority Leader today I'm introducing Intro 1294 a bill that names and shames deed thieves when it comes to
crime we are quick to post photos of people who steal diapers and baby formula from Wraid but when it comes to
the parasites who commit deed fraud and destabilize entire neighborhoods they often escape public scrutiny since 2014
there have been over 3,000 deed fraud complaints and those are just the cases we know about with the number likely
being much higher these thieves prey on older adults particularly black elders
people falling behind on their property or water taxes and families facing foreclosure they exploit moments of
financial stress and vulnerability to rob people of the American dream they
are white collar thugs enriching themselves at the expense of those who are most vulnerable this bill would send
a warning that we will catch you we will shame you and we will make sure every New Yorker sees your name your face and
your identifying information we will expose we will expose these criminals
who go on to often reaffend and who are helped by being able to hide behind LLC's and a veil of secrecy while the
council has invested in estate planning and foreclosure prevention and legal services for older adults more must be
done i thank Council Member Chio and Brooklyn Burough President Antonio Reynoso for co-primeing this bill and I
urge you all to sign on to it thank you Majority Leader recognizing Council Member Az followed
by Gutierrez and Salam
thank you Majority Leader today I'm introducing a resolution 870 alongside
council member de la Rosa and council member Joseph which would establish May in New York City schools as labor
history month while New York City is still a union town with the highest union density rate in all of the country
it probably doesn't come as a surprise to many of you that union membership has been steadily declining since the 70s
this is something we need to fix and if we have any hope at all of addressing
inequity with so much of our education system focused on job readiness and career prep for young people little to
no work has been done to prepare our future workforce to understand and protect their rights and guard
themselves against exploitation both now and in the future and now with
anti-immigrant sentiment at fever pitch states like Florida looking to child
labor law looking to roll back child labor laws to fill labor shortages
created by the fulfillment of their own racist fantasies to deport all brown people while it might seem that this
trend is new as of the most recent Trump administration a 2023 study by the
Economic Policy Institute revealed that 10 states have introduced legislation to
weaken child labor standards dismantling gains made over a century ago after the
triangle shirt waist fire such loosening of these critical laws not only leaves
our children vulnerable but creates opportunities to further dismantle unions and exacerbate inequality
nurturing young people to understand their inherent dignity is one of the greatest investments we can make to
ensure more just and equitable future i encourage all my colleagues to sign on
to this resolution and hope that our state will follow California in ensuring that this is part of our curriculum
thank you for your consideration recognizing Council Member Gutierrez followed by Salam then Brewer thank you
Madam Majority Leader today I'm proud to introduce two bills rooted in a shared principle that is of protecting New
Yorkers first I'm introducing the Safe Pregnancy and Opioid Treatment Act a bill that would require the health
department to educate providers on how to safely treat opioid use disorder during and after pregnancy and provide
Narcan at specific sites a report by the DOH recorded uh 241 deaths within a
5-year period um with approximately one in seven of those deaths attributed to overdoses more than 3/4ers of which
involved opioids this is a harm reduction bill a maternal health bill a
common sense public health bill and it's one that will save lives especially for the pregnant New Yorkers who have been
suffering in silence and ignored because of stigmas that might exist i also just want to thank uh Council Member Hanks
and uh Chair Schulman who have already co-sponsored this bill um Speaker Adams
and this council have put maternal mortal mortality front and center we're not afraid to be honest and have painful
conversations um when needed to put an end to these preventable deaths thank you to the speaker of course for her
support and contributions to this bill the second bill I'm introducing is the Fair Business B business practices act
resolution that calls on the state to finally outlaw unfair and abusive business practices right now New York
lags behind 42 other states in protecting consumers small businesses and nonprofits from scams junk fees and
AIdriven fraud i want to thank Attorney General Leticia James for her leadership on this bill i encourage all of my
colleagues to sign on and join me in protecting New Yorkers thank you recognizing Council Member Salam
followed by Brewer then Narcissis
madam Speaker and colleagues today I rise to honor the life of Congressman Charles Bernard
Wrangler the lion of Linux Avenue who passed away on May 26th of this year
2025 a decorated war ver veteran a founding member of the Congressional
Black Caucus and one of the longest serving members of Congress he was Harlem's unwavering champion from the
Gang of Four to the Halls of Power he fought for justice equity and
opportunity for all his legacy lives in the lives he changed the leaders he
inspired including myself and the dignity he brought to public service to
his family we offer deepest our deepest deepest condolences and to Harlem and
beyond we recommmit to carrying his vision forward may he rest in power and
may he rest in perfect peace thank you
recognizing council member Brewer followed by narcissis then wrestler thank you very much olivia son is then
wrestler thank you very much olivia Son is an intern in our office from Washington University we'll probably
have another hundred interns during the summer but I want to thank Olivia for being here i too want to say how much
we're going to miss Congressman Wrangle he was incredibly good to me for the last 40 years and also I want to um
express condolences to the family of Tom Robbins a reporter an investigative reporter for many years and he passed
last night um I want to mention reszo number 882 it is a resolution that talks
about Cuba um you probably know in ' 62 Kennedy issued a proclamation on the
trade embargo and then Obama opened up Cuba in uh 21 and of course Trump closed
it in um the Biden administration kept it going after it was closed by Trump
first time around biden opened it up a week before he left office and of course on January 20th Trump uh reinstated the
uh trade embargo i mention all this because the only other countries that have this trade embargo are Syria Iran
and North Korea and it seems to me that um the work that we are doing in this
country would fit well with Cuba and I would like to say that it should not be a state sponsor of terrorism um and on
that list were those other three countries that I mentioned thank you very much
recognizing Council Member Narcissis followed by Russler then Millie
thank you Madam Chair and thank you Madam Speaker for your leadership for far too long the people of Karsi have
been left behind when it comes to transit access my district is a transit desert and our residents students
working families seniors people with disabilities deserve more reliable and
accessibility transportation we need that in Kari i don't want to keep taking
too long but 1293 understand where we live in the South Brooklyn we cannot get
here it takes us about hour and a half and we talking about environmental problem we're talking about climate
change we need a break from Canari to get a ferry so Karsi once had a ferry
service and it's time we bought it back a ferry would give residents more ways
to get where they need to go while also helping to revitalize a pier that we
have that could truly use the boost right now it is viable transit option
and is an investment for the city and is a beautiful waterfront where everybody can enjoy i also proud to introduce and
I have to say thank you to Flossy that been standing with me for decades i'm also proud to introduce legislation that
will require the department of health and mental hygiene to launch a public
information and outreach campaign when it come to uterine fib um fibrosis
fibroid is real for a lot especially black women this is a condition that affects million of women especially when
we come to our community we know how health um inequities going throughout so
please my colleagues look into it by increasing that by increas by addressing
um fibrosis it will help a lot of women in our community our neighbors our
friends our sisters and brothers I urge my colleague to support this legislation it's about time and I'm also proud to
introduce a resolution calling on the state to require private de I mean developers of battery energy storage
system to carry liability insurance and provide financial support to nearby
homeowners in the event of a battery our time to clean energy must
never come at the expense of public safety council member Narc has expired
thank you so much council Member Wrestler thank you very much Madam Majority Leader uh I firstly just want
to echo Council Member Brewer's sentiments about the passing of Tom Robbins tom was one of the truly great
investigative journalists in our city uh for many years at the Village Voice more recently at the city uh he was be behind
that uh Eric Adams table of success linked all of the various corrupt actors
in the Adams orbit to the mayor um he was for many years a professor of
journalism at at the CUNI uh journalism school um he was the very first person
to say to me that Adrienne Adams should be our next mayor three years ago um he was a tenacious brilliant and savvy
journalist uh he held the powers that be accountable uh and he will be missed
dearly he was a constituent and somebody who I admired immensely um I also am very proud to be introducing legislation
today of which the number I do not know um but the bill uh creates a cooling off
period for the most powerful folks that enter into city service essentially this would uh prohibit employees with
substantial policymaking discretion senior staff at city hall agency heads etc from participating in determining
policy for any previous employer that they had worked for for the previous two years it would apply to lobbyists and
their clients to law firms and the the clients that lawyers represented uh it
is important that we close the revolving door in city government between lobbying
and public service and we passed legislation earlier this year to shut the revolving door on the way out for
people like Frank Coron when they leave city service but it's important that we also shut that door for the people entering in so they don't do favors for
the lobbying firms and the companies that they previously worked for when they enter into the public sector uh and
I hope my colleagues will in sponsor whatever the bill number is and I trust you all will figure it out thank you
1295 recognizing council member followed by Hanife good afternoon speaker Adams and
my colleagues as we gather today I would like to honor the life and legacy of
Congressman Charles B wrangle who passed away on May 26 at the age of 94 harlem
native a career war veteran congressman Rang Wrangle dedicated nearly five
decades to public service representing New York's 13th Congressional District
from 1971 to 2017
and he was the first African-American who housed the ways and
means was the chair and I would like to also in solidarity I can say um the
passing of Judge Luther C williams Jr passing on May 30th the father of
Shane's restaurant owner his father passed and he was a friend and a
dedicated servant to the community after he retired he still was in my political
club and did anything possible to help the community and I would like to
um as we gather today I would like to honor the life and legacy i'm sorry I
did that and additionally I would like to um talk about the Asian-American heritage i want to emphasize the
importance of the resolution 844 that we passed earlier this month establishing
Chinese American rail road workers on Memorial Day and I would like to
say just this past Monday we all observed Memorial Day a solemn occasion
to remember and pay tribute to the brave men and women who have made the ultimate
sacrifice in servicing to our nation their courage and dedication continue to
inspire our commitment to justice equality and the well-being of all New
Yorkers thank you recognizing Council Member Haneife thank
you thanks to this council May is officially lupus awareness month in New York City recognized through resolution
550 which we passed in 2023 as someone living with lupus I want to honor my
fellow lupus warriors across New York City each of us carries a different story but we all face the reality of
living with an incurable autoimmune disease that's why we need more public
education on lupus symptoms faster diagnosis and better access to
specialists but awareness isn't enough we need policy changes that includes a
fully ADA accessible transit system remote work protections and free public
health care these are not luxuries they're lifesaving i've shared my lupus
journey many times so folks understand why I may take the stairs a little
slower and why I'm so committed to building a caring accessible city living
with lupus taught me grit and more importantly compassion for myself and
for others that compassion fuels my fight for disability justice immigrant justice universal health care
reproductive care and workplace protections lupus shaped my leadership
