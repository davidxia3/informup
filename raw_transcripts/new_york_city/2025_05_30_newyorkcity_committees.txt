for being here today thank you for joining us to answer our questions but before I go any further I want to invite
our speaker Adrienne Adams to give her opening remarks
thank you Finance Chair good morning or good morning yeah good morning everyone
um thank you Finance Chair Brandon for holding today's executive budget hearing this is the last for
FY26 the mayor's executive budget for fiscal year 26 is
$115.1 billion it's an increase of half a billion dollars from the FY26
preliminary budget this week the council unveiled our latest economic and tax
forecast which shows consistent revenue projections that continue to outpace OMBs by 1.7 billion for fiscal years
2025 and 2026 our city's economy is resilient
despite the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's volatile economic and tariff policies that have undermined
US economic growth prior to the tariffs and trade policy turmoil the national
economy was expected to grow at a healthy rate of around 2.1% this year
now due to Trump's policies the council expects economic growth to fall one to
1.3% in 2025 during this period of chaos from the federal government the council's
focus is on advancing investments that help make our city safer and more affordable new Yorkers count on our city
budget to prioritize their needs and make it possible for them to build their lives in our great city while the
executive budget includes some key investments that the council has long called for and were included in our
preliminary budget response there remains work to do to ensure that the adopted budget includes vital funding
for programs missing in the mayor's executive budget new Yorkers from our
youngest to our seniors depend on cultural institutions libraries and
parks to maintain meaningful connections to each other their cultures and their
communities our parks are a lifeline for our city annually they receive over 100
million visits and yet compared to other major American cities New York City
allocates a significantly less proportion of its budget to our parks department we need to narrow that gap
and allocate more funding for key programs staffing and maintenance so that our parks can remain clean and safe
for all to enjoy and our seniors who are the crown jewels of our communities
deserve further support we would not be here without them and yet so many are struggling to age in place and still
experience food insecurity we can address this by expanding access to home
delivered meals and upgrading older adult centers that provide essential services to advance public safety the
mayoral administration must adequately invest in the programs proven to make our communities safer following through
on the city's commitment to close Rikers as a part of improving public safety we must invest at the scale needed in
mental health and community-based safety programs that are proven to reduce recidivism help crime victims recover
and stop cycles of violence while some funding has been added into the executive budget our investments are
still incomplete the city budget must commit additional funding for residential treatment beds for people
with mental health challenges justice involves supportive housing and other criminal other critical
interventions we must also support working families by fully investing in our public schools child care vouchers
and early childhood education programs like 3K and preK ensuring the stability
of the state's child care assistance program vouchers is critical to protecting families access to affordable
child care we need to move forward towards expanding access to all families
not simply protecting what currently exists which we know leaves too many without support cuni NICHA and housing
investments also need to be prioritized in the final budget finally community- based organizations
and nonprofits serving on the front lines of our communities rely on council funding to deliver for New Yorkers we
need to ensure the city keeps its commitment to them and to the communities that they serve director
Jihi hoped to hear from you today about the steps OM is taking to address these outstanding issues in this budget we've
spent the past days of budget hearings listening to agency officials and New Yorkers about the immense needs in our
city and it's critical that the city delivers for them thank you very much and now I turn it back over to Chair
Brent thank you speaker uh as you mentioned yesterday the council released
our economic and tax forecast for the FY26 budget and the findings from our
updated analysis remain consistent with what the council has been arguing through the budget process new York
City's economy continues to show resilience with higher tax revenues than projected by OM over FY25 and
26 even though our economic growth lags below our long run average the council's
tax revenue forecast remains largely the same as our previous forecast this past February with shifts in the timing of
revenues we project that the city will collect a total of $1.7 billion more in
tax revenue in the current and next fiscal years than OMB projects in their May plan it's driven largely by stronger
collections in property tax personal income tax and unincorporated business taxes additionally we project $2.5
billion greater tax revenue collection in FY27 3.2 billion in FY28 and 3.9 billion
in FY29 the council sees tax revenue to grow at an average of 4.5% annually
through the forecast period while trending the right way remains below the
5 a.5% annual growth the city saw in the prior decade while the council does not
project a dream economic environment that's no rationale for aggressive cuts and failing to make use of every
resource we have on hand we have what we need to preserve neighborhood cornerstones like our parks libraries
and cultural institutions as well as to protect essential services like housing
mental health care and early childhood education that keeps New Yorkers on their feet the more we put and the more
we invest into New Yorkers the more New York City will get back i'll have questions today uh focused largely on
the unincorporated business tax sales tax reserves uh city agency headcount
the capital budget and several issues that came up in our prior hearings uh just as a reminder for everyone uh who's
with us today uh only written testimony will be admitted for today's hearing so if you wish to submit written testimony
for the record you may email it to testimony@counsel.nyc.gov gov anytime up to 72 hours after the
conclusion of today's hearing audio and video recordings will not be admitted but transcripts of such recordings can

can get started good morning do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but
the truth before this committee and to respond honestly to council member questions director
Jihop first Deputy Godner i do um Deputy Director Boyard i do and
Deputy Director McKenna i do thank you you may begin
thank you you may begin sit the mic
good morning Speaker Adams Chair Brennan and members of the Finance Committee and City Council
thank you for the opportunity to testify here today about the fiscal year 2026
executive budget i'm Jacquesha and I'm the director of the
New York City Mayor's Office of Management and Budget i'm joined by OM
First Deputy Director Ken Gardner and senior deputy directors Tabard and
Latana McKini the fiscal year 2026 executive budget is balanced at $115.1
billion with u manageable outyear gaps of $4.6 billion $5.8 billion and $5.7
billion in fiscal year uh 27 through 29 our budget res our budget reserves
remain at a record level of $8.5 billion
four fundamental elements shape the executive budget a strong economy
significant savings sound and targeted investments and fiscal
discipline first the economy like you said remains resilient as a result the
labor market is strong with employment at an all-time high and unemployment
declining across all demographics notably unemployment among black and
Hispanic New Yorkers has dropped by more than two percentage points since this
administration took office the city population is also rebounding from the pandemic era dip and
tourism has returned to near record levels additionally Wall Street posted a
near record performance in 2024 this strong economic growth led to an
upward revision in tax revenue forecast over the fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget of $1.7 billion in fiscal year 25
and $1 billion in fiscal year 26 this represent growth of about 8% in
fiscal year 2025 but tax revenue is projected to grow by about 1% next fiscal year as the
economy is anticipated to slow achieving savings is a key
administration priority total savings in this plan are $1.9 billion over fiscal
year 25 and 26 and were attained without service cuts or layoffs
this includes asylum seeker savings of 298 million $298 million in fiscal year
25 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 26 to reflect the census
decline this brings the two-year savings total from all sources over the last
three plan to nearly $6.8 8
billion as a program we're able to make critical
upstreams investment and reduce risks in the financial plan by baselining funding
for many recurring programs that have been funded with short-term stimulus dollars or one year at a time
and despite our good fortune we remain fiscally disciplined we invested
prudently city funded expenditure within the fiscal year 2026 executive budget
grew just 1.3% over the preliminary budget and it is
2.2% or $2 billion lower than it was at last year's executive budget
we added nearly $900 million to protect critical services for the most
vulnerable uh members of our community in the current fiscal year this includes the
city Medicaid contribution City Feb's rental assistance cash assistance HIV AIDS
housing services and housing vouchers and social services for seniors and more
we took steps to support human services providers and nonprofits that partner
with the city to deliver essential services to the community by funding and
direct uh rate growth for New York City aging the New York City public schools
and our human resources administration and making cost of living adjustments
for criminal justice providers we also invested 1.4 4 billion
in public safety cleanliness affordability education and child care in fiscal year 26 and more than
$675 million is baseline it is important to highlight
that many of these investments are supported by members of this council
there is no end to what we can achieve together for our communities for our
city and for our future to safeguard the constitutional right to council we strengthened support
for indigent defense providers we also funded criminal justice initiatives
including alternatives to incarceration and enhanced supervision and to promote
successful re-entry we are helping decarcerated individuals secure housing
employment mentorship and healthcare and we added support for tra
trauma trauma recovery centers which provide safe spaces and treatment
through super surviv survivors of violent crime who have less access to
traditional victim services we have also increased staffing at the
civilian complaint review board further we fun the funding
in by the fall of 2026 in this plan we are also deepening
the mayor's commitment to his get stuff clean and trash evolution initiatives by
baselineing support for little basket pickup throughout the city spaces that
were frequently overlooked historically not wellkept and trash pick up on the pay meter of parks and greenways
this is on top of the investment we made in the preliminary budget to expand the parks department second shift bringing
resources to 100 new hotspots in 65 64 parks across the five
BS in this plan we have added over $und00 million dollar annually to
backfill expired stimulus dollars and restore savings to New York City aging
this funding will help ensure dignity and quality of life for older New Yorkers through home deliver meals older
adult centers and more and to fight food insecurity we have included funding for
over 700 food pantries across the city through the community food connection
program and the popular groceries to go program and because cost should not be a
barrier to getting to work school or to the doctors we will maintain funding for
fairs and once again summer youth employment participants will receive
free metro cards we restored nearly $und00 million in funding for CUNI and
maintain support for the ACE and the ASAP programs and the Brooklyn recol
further we added $45 million in annual support for the New York City Department
of Cultural Affairs Cultural Development Fund and Cultural Institution Group this
is the first time in 20 years that this funding has been baseline we also added
more than $15 million towards the public library budget branch budget next fiscal
year now there is annual funding for nearly $200 million for education
programs that have been supported with short-term stimulus to ensure the
continuity of these critical programs we baseline resources for 3K arts education
teachers equipment project pivot computer science education
and and we have also baseline support for over 700 early childhood education
seats for three and four years old in special education prek further the mayor has has expanded
the after school for all program which will strengthen and scale the program to
achieve the mayor's vision of making the program universal this includes adding
seats for 220,000 K5 students by the fall of
2027 this is a baseline investment that goes to $330 million over the financial
plan and in two fiscal years the city will work with community groups to
conduct a needs assessment and gather input on further slat
expansion though there's much more to say on education and child care I will also highlight three other priorities we
committed baseline funding for school nurses new teachers to meet class- size
targets and we are funding Promise New York in NYC in the year ahead
because reading writing communication skills are crucial to social and economic mobility we are investing in
adult literacy programming although we have made a robust investment and baseline many many
initiatives for the first time we must acknowledge the significant challenge
challenges and risks that remain ahead we are still caring for more than
38,000 is asylum seekers on our own at a monthly cost of approximately $200
million with total estimated cost since July 2022 totaling $7.7
billion in the preliminary budget we had assumed that the state will provide $1
billion in resources in its fiscal year 26 budget to cover migrant
expenses because we had to release the executive budget before state budget adoption and it was apparent at the time
that the state would not meet this need we backfilled this budget hole with city
resources we also reflected cost shift of $166 million annually related to MTA
par transit obligations and after 4 p.m school
busing to our disappointment the adopted state budget
shifted far more cost to the city than we had anticipated
this includes an $275 million annual increase in the city's contribution for
child care vouchers which has grown to $328
million altogether the state budget will cost city taxpayers an additional $550
million annually bringing the total state budget impact to about $1.7
billion we also face risks related to funding
cuts at the federal level and changes to grant requirements in addition the trade
policy announced in early April and the subsequent impact on financial markets
pose a potential threat threat to the city's economy as well as its tax base
the federal administration is reviewing grants to ensure that they comply with the president recent executive orders
and has terminated funding for some entities additionally several federal
agencies have added grant certification requirements designed to force
conformity with revised immigration and diversity equity and inclusion policies
our office in coordin in coordination with the law department is closely
monitoring grant cancellations and new grant requirement and the city's actively engage in litigation where
appropriate often in conjunction with other localities but at the end of the day we
may have to make very difficult decisions about the extent of our ongoing reliance on federal funding to
support critical city services some may be tempted to apply budget
reserves but these funds would only provide temporary
support once these reserves are used they are gone the reality is that no
municipality has the resources to backfill federal funding put simply we
have some serious challenges ahead of us as we get closer to budget adoption I
look forward to working with the council to protect the city's interest in Albany and Washington and to identify resources
to fund our many joint priorities to support our recovery promote public
health and safety expand opportunity and improves and improve the lives of
everyday New Yorkers thank you and I look forward to your questions
thank you very much uh we've been joined by council members Hank Salam Riley and
and uh Majority Leader Fius and now I'm going to turn to Speaker Adams for her
questions thank you Chair and welcome it's good to see you
all the administration's two for one hiring policy has been in effect for more than a year
in that time I have heard numerous commissioners blaming staffing levels and hiring issues for issues their
agencies have with provision of critical services the city's current actual
full-time headcount is slightly over 286,000 which is more than 5% less than
the headcount of just before the COVID pandemic in that same period the city's budgeted full-time headcount declined by
only 1.9% vacancies continue to be an issue
citywide so my questions on this issue are is the two for one hiring freeze
still in effect what positions are currently exempted from the hiring freeze and are there any plans to end
the hiring freeze in the near future especially given the issues agencies have providing services
yeah um as you can imagine the high um embedded in our budget is savings
from uh the 241 and uh and as you can imagine we are
dealing with some serious challenges ahead of us so therefore the policy remains in place however we have
exempted okay a number of positions from the 241 including uniform personnel
inspectors and revenue generating positions any position dealing with public health public safety and revenue
generation we have exempted those positions and some critical position for instance in cash assistance uh program
so we have exempted many of these uh uh positions we are working with agencies
to assess their needs on a day on a day-to-day basis and when there is a
severe problem that we believe needs to be addressed we we usually try to make an exemption for those uh cases
so as far as the revenue generating positions are are concerned you are stopping there and everything else is on
an individual case basis what will be considered then um a revenue generating position uh revenue engineering pushment
would be an auditor no no I understand that part i I mean as far as going on a case-byase basis your
determination then as far as hearing from your agencies would determine what
is revenue generating we we have revenue generating positions we also have as I
said uniform public safety public health and when based on our discussion with the agencies if uh they have a need that
is pressing we usually tend to address those needs okay so there are no plans
uh to lift the hiring freeze in the near future you're just going to go on an individual case basis going forward not
at this moment but as you know we have made significant significant progress in term of the vacancy in New York City i
mean uh last in June of 2023 it was at 7 and a half% now we are down to like 5.9%
so we we're making progress okay all right let's talk a little bit about NYPD headcount in order to get a
handle on the rampant usage of overtime the commissioner stated that one of her strategies was to have as many uniformed
officers on the streets the NYPD's budgeted uniform headcount is
currently 35,000 with over 1300 vacancies there are also over 1,600
civilian vacancies including key titles like 911 operators what is the plan to
fill these vacancies and what role has OM played in helping the NYPD fill vacancies to be fully staffed to its
budgeted headcount we currently are working with uh the uh NYPD to make sure
that uh they got all the resources that they need we give them approval i believe to have had 3,500
uh officers this year um and um same thing with the 911 operators um because
they are exempt from their hiring fees so it's just a question of um you know and we've been approving you know all
the requests that they uh they have sent us so far
okay thank you in in looking at the child care voucher funding shortfall and
the state budget which you um alluded to in your opening statement at the
preliminary budget hearing ACS indicated that the city was projecting a shortfall in state and federal funding to support
the city's child care voucher program through the upcoming federal fiscal year
which is October 1st 2025 through September 30th 2026 because the state enacted its
budget after the release of your executive plan it didn't address the child care voucher funding gap but now
we know that the enacted state budget includes an additional $350 million
appropriation that the city can access to cover the cost of child care vouchers
based on the language in the enacted state budget how much is the city required to contribute to access the
full additional $350 million of state funds um it is uh $328 million which is
uh what uh the MOE is uh is uh is asking for uh but again we will continue to
work with ACS to assess the program to assess the need of the program and see uh where we going to end at the end of
the day because it's still waiting for guidance from the state okay to assess uh uh those funds and uh I believe
recently uh the state uh approved uh the uh the continuity of care program which
prioritize our low-inccome population for low-inccome vouchers so again we're
working with them but bas basically what the minimum we need to put in is about $328 million okay thank you at the
preliminary budget hearing with ACS the commissioner indicated the agency projected its child care voucher
expenditures for fiscal year 2026 at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion is
that still the projected cost and can you please explain to me the calculations for how this cost was
derived and why the range is so broad it's it's again it's based on certain
assumptions uh that uh that are made and again as I said I would defer to uh um
ACS uh to provide you more explanation but based on our own uh calculation we
believe that uh um you know we
um we will provide we'll get the resources that we need to make sure that the needs are met by the public but the
mayor made the decision that this is such a critical program that we have to fund this program to
make sure that the needs of the parents are met so again we will continue to
work with ACS to assess uh how much is needed as I said and based on the
guidance that would be provided to them by the state and we'll make an assessment in the future of what the needs are
so you agree with the commissioner that the uh projection is still 1.5 billion
and between two 1.5 and 2 billion again as I said it's so many uh moving
parts again these forecasts are based on assumptions you know
and you know any change in the assumptions could change the numbers so what we commit to the mayors make the
commitment that this is so critical for parents that we will be working with ACS
to make sure that if there is a need we will begin we will address those need as
we go throughout the year okay along those same lines at the preliminary
budget hearing with ACS the commissioner indicated they weren't processing new applicants and putting children on
waiting lists at the executive budget hearing um sorry the commissioner said
the agency was working with OM to include more money so families currently receiving a voucher would keep them what
is the plan and does the administration still intend to put families on weight lists what plans does the administration
have to eliminate weight lists and how much money does it project this to cost
yeah we uh we put we have a wait list and as I said uh you know as we go
forward we continue to assess the program because at this moment in time we can't tell you fully you know what's
going to be needed to take care of the waiting list again because so many assumptions you know in terms of how
many people were going to be um was going to return to you know in term of people on cash assistance what's going
to be the uptake so we don't know a lot of pieces so we're doing an assessment As I said there's a commitment on the
part of the administration to make sure that parents have the resources that they need so we're just going to
continue to work with that what are the needs and also
work with the state is is there a plan though it doesn't sound like there is is there a plan to actually eliminate the
weight list or is this just indefinitely no there's there they working on a plan
to you know get rid of weight list to begin with we have to make sure we cap the program to get a full grasp of
what's going on to begin with okay and once we have a grasp of what's going on then we'll make a decision in terms of
how we're going to proceed going forward okay last year we fought to continue to
provide principles with adequate funding so that their budgets wouldn't decrease drastically from year to year will the
administration work with the council to initially hold schools harmless for any enrollment declines in the 2025 2026
school year as you did last year at adoption we will work we'll continue to work with the council and uh and we
discuss discuss this as part of budget adoption is that a commitment uh we will work with with the council
okay let's talk a little bit about the state budget and housing the state enacted budget includes over $1 billion
in additional capital funding for housing development construction and preservation that was secured as part of
our city of Yes and City for all agreement the state budget gives broad categories for which funding can be used
based on the agreement and requires the city to seek approval for spending plans from the state budget director what kind
of input is OM going to have in the process and how is it approaching this
um these are state fund and OM you know technically we are not you know uh the
entity that's responsible to submit the plan uh we will make a plan with NICHA
for how to use this fund and NICHA would work with the state directly for
approval in a timely manner and those fund that are expected to support HPD project will forward
directly to those projects while we plan to remain in close contact with the state about uh those
allocations to the state for approval in a time timely and efficient way it t you
want to take this on hello hi uh we won't be submitting the plans that'll be done largely by the
housing authority as well as HPD but we'll be working in coordination with them okay we will work with them but
we're not directly submitting those plans it's NICHA and HPD okay got it
let's look a little at um potential federal cuts right now the fiscal 2026
budget includes over $7.4 billion of federal funds allocated across many city
agencies but we're all well aware that there's a very real chance that come November this estimate may need to be
decreased what safeguards do you have in place to make sure that critical city services are not interrupted if this
happens madam Speaker um we will fight for every federal
dollar that New Yorkers deserve um New Yorkers pay their
fair and should not be penalized simply
because the cities is following state and local laws
so we will continue to fight as hard as we can okay to make sure that we get
every doubt that we deserve now if for whatever reason
we we lose some ch you know some of our legal challenges we will basically we have a
decision matrix that we go in house we review we assess every single one of
these programs and uh if the program is deemed to be very critical we will come back to
the mayor and the council with recommendations in term of what to backfill but not to backill it but what
we said before and we'll continue to maintain the same uh um uh posture is
given the scope the size of you know the amount of money that that is involved no
municipality has the resources to backfill federal funding understood okay
so we have city is not the only uh place in this
country that is at jeopardy right now yes for federal funding loss what what I'd like to hear though
is that will OM work with work with the city council to create a plan of course
we as a have is we don't want to send signal
okay to uh DC that it's okay to cut
funding with impunity because hey we we know every case that we're making is
they causing harm to the city okay so you don't want to create a plan that says hey I have resources to backfill
all of these things so in that case there's no harm understood okay So therefore we don't want to telegraph
okay all the steps all the measures that we plan on taking but uh we will
definitely work with the council because this is our job to basically to face that challenge together because in the
extreme case it would be very challenging for the city to deal with this thing i agree thousand% um and
thank you for agreeing to work collaboratively with us to create a plan if needed let's talk a little bit about
homeless shelter costs in the current year the city has budgeted over $2.6 billion for the cost of housing the
non-assylum seeker homeless population this year's budget has increased by over
$760 million since adoption alone the city plans to spend more to shelter the
homeless this year than the entire fiscal 2026 budgets of all but five city
agencies year after year we spend more and more to house the homeless is paying
the costs of the homeless shelter system the most coste effective strategy to
combat and respond to homelessness um it is
um put it this way we have to tackle these things it's like not one at the
expense of the other okay uh we need shelter to deal with the short-term stay
short-term challenges that we're dealing with somebody who wants you know overnight stay so you're going to need
to have a shelter program for that group of people but at the same time we also need long long-term housing okay to deal
with the long-term problem which is the shortage of housing that we have in the city so we have to tackle it on both
angle you know but you know uh uh we have to look at it from uh these two perspective we need both shelter and
housing it's not one at the expense of the other what other approaches is the city taking
to reduce shelter costs and move people from homelessness to permanent housing
we've one of the most effective tool we have has been the uh CDF's voucher as
you can see the program has grown exponentially in the last uh five years
it's a program that started with about $300 million it's not about $1.2 billion you know so it's because you
know we basically are issuing a lot of vouchers to folks to get them out of the
shadow system which this council has advocated for time and time again
yes we understand but thank you for those gold stars how much is included in the budget for
programs that would move the homeless into permanent housing we again as I said we have uh resources
added to the budget for we have resources in the budget for um city feeps this is one of uh as I said one of
the most effective tools that we have and we'll continue to assess different
policies do you have a figure i'm sorry do you have a figure how much uh how
much you currently have city febs right now i believe for fiscal year 25 we're
projecting we're going to spend about like $1.3 billion uh for city fabs and
um we added $325 million in the preliminary budget and for uh
2026 we'll begin to address uh you know uh some of the needs as uh we move
throughout uh the fiscal year
okay all right let's talk about uh public safety investments to close Rikers and mental health the Independent
Rikers Commission released its blueprint to close Rikers identifying a number of key investments the city must take into
mental health and public safety programs that are not only critical to closing Rikers but also addressing the city's
mental health crisis and improving public safety the executive budget added some important funding for mental health
programs and recidivism reduction programs but there are still remaining gaps to ensure these programs actually
have the capacity to fulfill the needs New Yorkers have for them for example justice involves supportive housing
supervised released intensive case management re-entry programs mobile
treatment teams and mental health residential treatment beds are all underfunded or unfunded in the budget
many of these programs can be cost-effective by saving the city the higher expenses of unnecessarily placing
people who could be helped with treatment into jails that cost more and don't solve their underlying issues
while increasing the likelihood that they will repeatedly return to jail and
cost the city in various other ways seems like a vicious circle to me how
does OM analyze the cost effectiveness of prevention programs and is there any assessment made that it would be wiser
for the city to invest more in effective mental health and prevention programs so they actually reach people reducing the
accompanying costs when they're inaccessibility leads to other bad outcomes essentially this is the concept
that prevention is more coste effective than an emergency room response
we wholly agree with you and that's the reason why in the executive budget we made so many investment in uh trying to
reduce uh uh the uh jail population um you know as you know we funded uh uh an
extension of the intensive case management pilot in the executive budget with 9.1 uh million dollars we have
Joseph justice involve uh support housing uh there FP out there for up to
500 we have uh uh mobile uh treatment funded in the exec for like $45
million we uh baseline um funding for project reset and rapid reset we
baseline funding uh in for $7.6 6 million for alternative to incarceration
services we baseline $4.7 million to help stabilize recently decarcerated
individual with re-entry planning services we you know so we we made a
bunch of uh $9.1 million in intensive case management pilot to provide
enhanced supervision for,00 defendants so again we fully agree with you that
many of these programs you know this program are effective and that's the reason why we made so much investment in
you know in the uh executive budget on these programs thank you um we're we want to take a
look at expanding that a bit the recently enacted state budget included up
toing agreement for the for the council's city for all housing plan is
the administration planning to use any of these funds to open the 380 additional
units of justice involved supported housing promised in the 2019 points of agreement on closing Rikers and also
recently recommended by the independent Riker's commission t you want to take that
okay we'll get back to you on question on this on this topic because we will work with the state and apply for all
the funds but we'll get back to you okay that specific answer that's pretty critical because that works with
everything that we're all trying to do sure with this subject matter okay thank you Mr chair thank you for your time
thank you ma'am thank you speaker um I want to jump into the credit rating so
Moody's uh downgraded uh US credit rating from AAA negative to double A1
stable on May 16th I believe uh reflecting accelerated deficit growth
and associated borrowing requirements a
fiscal OM anticipate any indirect effects of the US credit downgrade on
our bonds here in the city put it this way we do not anticipate a
direct impact on city bonds however there may be some indirect impact in the
sense that to the extent that
but we do not anticipate a direct impact okay on city bonds
and each of the three major rating agencies expressed concern about the city's long-term liabilities
includilities for retirees how seriously is the city taking the issue of
long-term liabilities including but not limited to pensions
um we have some while we have considerable uh uh long-term
liabilities we have to also remember that we are managing those liability within uh um uh our ability to
meet those obligations the coverage that we have is more than enough to be quite
honest with you to uh support those debt for instance um the um city uh total
debt outstanding okay has gone substantially slower than our own personal income or
the value of taxable properties okay which is what you usually use over the
last 10 years meaning that the city can now afford uh uh to his debt to carries that today
okay better than he was 10 years ago so we have the debt coverage you know
personal income is growing faster than the pace at which we uh uh issue debt um
our pension another good example was funded at 81% back in 2022 now we at 86%
and uh we continue to make the uh actual required required contribution which
would be means that uh we would be uh 100% funded if all the assumptions are
met so we feel comfortable with the way we have managed our long-term debt so we
have enough coverage for those uh debts so therefore it's not a major issue for us
okay um I'm talking about taxable bonds so while all city debt is issued to
finance projects with a public purpose some capital projects are not eligible uh to utilize federal tax exempt bonds
um could you tell us what sort of projects are not eligible to be financed by taxexempt bonds uh pursuant to
federal uh uh tax rule project that have both private
use and actual or deemed private payments to the city uh may not be
financed with tax exemp uh bonds um this category includes uh affordable housing
loans and many economic development projects so what we do is we review all capital
project to ensure that they are properly designated as eligible for tax exempt or
taxable bonds and what's the average what what's the average spread between the interest rates on the city's tax
exempt and taxable bonds it's about one and a half to 2% and I believe on a 10
year maturity last two years was about 1.9% percentage point
okay um talk about reserves uh Standard and Poor's most recent rating of the
city's general obligation bonds notes that the city has large financial reserves of almost 11.4 billion at fis
at uh the end of fiscal year 24 uh S&P looks at both the city's reserve
accounts and surplus budget roles at the end of the fiscal year when evaluating uh how they come up with our reserves
what level of financial reserves as measured by S&P does OM think we'll have
at the end of FY25 um at this point in time we know we have
uh the um the total reserve is about $8.5 billion and I think with in the
executive budget right now we have prepayments of about $3 billion total i
mean including the 600 million so you're talking right now at 11 and a half
so it'll be about the same as the end of FY24 we're probably going to end up probably same probably the same place
okay okay
um and besides being a way to protect city services during a downturn reserves can also help us lower the effective
cost of our capital projects um how much additional deposits into the reserves do
you think would be necessary to uh uh affectuate a ratings
increase uh I to be quite honest with you I think the the level of reserve that we have right now is uh adequate
and I'm I said it over and over because we believe uh we also need some
flexibility in term of the way we manage uh our finances so reserve by itself is
not in itself is not it's one of those factors but by itself it's not going to
trigger uh uh um a rating increase so from my perspective is you have to look
at on top you know the way we manage our debt the way we manage city finances
uh you have to look at the economy it's a it's a number of factors that play into uh uh an increase in uh in the um
in our rating so therefore just you know just the reserve by itself from our perspective is not you know in itself
you know enough to trigger but again as far as we're concerned we believe the
the level of res that reserve that we have right now is appropriate is adequate uh for uh to uh to deal with a
potential downturn in the economy and how much does the typical increase in the city's bond rating save the city in
lower debt service costs it is about like uh 5 to 10 basis
points so if you show issuing let's say $10 billion worth of debt you're talking
about five to$10 million
okay um the executive plan included uh $266 million in savings from writing off
prior year receivables and expenses this year uh this is after finding a similar
uh $500 million in savings in the preliminary plan making a total of over $800 million in savings this year in in
past years at most uh the city took 400 millions of savings from these
write-offs so c can you explain the process that OM goes through to determine these savings and how how do
you identify these savings and what's the and then how what's the process for writing them off yeah uh this one in the
executive budget was related to I believe it's an asylum seeker uh um
breakdown and this wasn't a cool that was put up in fiscal year 2023
uh you know and we were writing it down this year and is that why the savings for FY25 are so much higher than
previous years yes okay which agencies have the highest
amount of prior year revenues written off um I could give you that information
okay on top of it okay um I want to talk about uh CDPAP
the home healthcare employment has been rapidly expanding in the city as baby boomers reach uh their senior years uh
in April uh 293,000 New Yorkers were employed in this sector which was around
9 and a half% uh or about almost 30,000 jobs greater
than at the same point in the prior year new York State's consumerdirected uh personal assistance program CDPAP um
funded through Medicaid allows recipients to choose a home health care provider including relatives and friends
uh recently New York State has transformed the management of CDPAP from using many individual fiscal
intermediaries to only one statewide intermediary uh NYSPL to reduce costs
waste and fraud what are the anticipated implica implications of this structural
change uh to the city's home healthcare job growth uh like you said uh this is was uh one
of the drivers for us in term of uh uh employment gain um the state regulate
this program at this moment in time I cannot tell you exactly how this thing is going to play out but uh uh you know
our expectation is is probably going to lead some to some kind of uh decrease in the uh number of job in that
sector but at this moment in time I can't tell you for sure do you anticipate that that the cuts that uh
the president and Congress are supporting for Medicaid funding for states would exacerbate this this
employment area that could be okay um talking about the overall tax
revenue forecast uh FY25 tax revenues have been coming in a lot stronger than anyone expected including us and the
council in the executive plan OMB raised the FY tax revenue forecast by almost $1.7 billion more than half of that
increase was driven by a PIT the personal income tax up over 800 million it's a very big adjustment could you
tell us what caused you to increase the forecast so much uh as uh as I indicated
to you uh was at a near record level of profit in
2024 and so basically that uh basically drives bonus payments drives you know a
number of uh of our taxes to uh uh um to
come up higher than we initially anticipated and since you locked the forecast have
you seen any indications that it might uh cause you to revise it either way up or down
at this point in time no we don't anticipate to uh uh change our forecast dramatically
um because we believe we are on on target or slightly probably you know
close to what we projecting um we'll continue to access
uh uh uh the data tax revenue data as we get closer to the end of June because uh
June is a big month uh for these uh business taxes and we'll get a better
sense of uh where we will be but as you know the uh um final um um final rule
came out and I believe uh our forecast uh was overstated by about like $169
million or 130 by about $150 million so um so you
know I wouldn't be very aggressive in terms of property tax uh forecast for
next year based on the final because right now we looking at $169 million $59 million uh uh less than we had
anticipated in the um executive budget forecast the sales talking about sales
tax the executive plan includes a downward revision in the city sales tax forecast from the January plan um what
potential impacts does OMB assume the Trump administration's tariff chaos will
have on consumer prices in New York City i mean to the extent that u you know if
uh you know everybody's done with the forecast of uh the economy and if you
have a slowdown in the uh in the uh in the economy so we expect consumer to
spend less if consumer to spend less we expect sales tax to grow to decline as
well okay last question for me i want to turn over my colleagues uh in a crypto event
that the mayor attended in Las Vegas a couple days ago he announced that New York City will issue bit bonds has the
administration approached you about this idea we we just like we we review every
single you know we always trying to be at the frontier of technology new York is a leading uh city so therefore we
always work with different industry players to see what can be done uh right now we are in the ideation phase people
are talking bring ideas to the table to see what can be done what cannot be done good ideas bad ideas so that's where we
are there's nothing concrete at this moment in time but like everything else we in communication with we're in
constant you know communication with different industry leaders to see what because we always try to bring new
investors into the mix for New York City but there's nothing concrete did you know the mayor was going to announce
this great idea um I don't think he announc he's saying they're working on ideas we're not saying he's not saying
he didn't say that they're going to launch uh Bitcoin they you know we we're
working on the with the industry i mean he said he's I mean you know look the city bonds have a reputation of
stability and rel reliability i think everyone agrees that bitcoins and crypto that whole asset class is renowned for
chaos and scams and volatility um we barely have 20 years of historical data
on bitcoins and crypto why is the mayor suggesting that the city would invest in
crypto listen we exploring ideas we are not uh Do you think it's a good idea
listen I I can't tell you anything that is good or bad until we know for sure we
we in a process of exploring things this is something new okay we shouldn't be afraid of something because it's new
okay people used to rob bank i mean the city bonds city bonds have city bonds
have such a reputation for stability and reliability bitcoin is like the opposite of but it's just exploring there's
nothing wrong with exploring ideas you know there's nothing wrong with exploring ideas we shouldn't be afraid of exploring things all right i mean
listen to me this is I'm I'm fine going exploring but I think the safari should end immediately
all right Jo thank you um we've also been joined by council members Hudson Moya Dinowitz Joseph Stevens and Brewer
we will send it now to Majority Whip Brooks Powers for her questions thank
you chair and uh thank you for the testimony today uh I'm because I have a
lot to get through I'm going to just ask ask the questions you answer and I can repeat whatever so the first one is
focusing on the Department of Transportation and the streets plan in DOT's most recent streets plan report
which was released in March the department indicated that in 2024 it only built 13.5 miles of
protected bus lanes which once again is far short of the 30 miles required
annually dot is also required to install transit signal priority also known as
TSP at 1,000 intersections annually but completed only 766 this year
has DOT requested any additional staff to help the agency meet the streets plan
mandates if so how many additional positions and how much funding would be needed to support them what can we
expect that they will when can we expect that they will be added when it comes to
bus lanes DOT has consistently failed to meet the streets plan requirements and has fallen behind the aggregate 5-year
target how is the administration's prioritizing bus lane improvements and
what plans are in place to meet the required mandates for bus lanes why has
DOT been able to come closer to meeting the bike lane requirements but not the
targets for bus lanes and bus stops does OM feel that DOT has enough funding to
meet all streets plan mandates if not how much additional funding will be added and when if so why not i'm excuse
me why is DOT not able to meet the streets plan mandate also since the executive budget
has been published I want to understand what progress the administration has made in addressing um particularly two
main issues that I've consistently raised one is does the administration commit to expanding the fair
affairs program to cover New Yorkers earning up to 200% of the federal
poverty level also does the administration commit to funding the $300,000 needed
for the land transfer of the Far Rockaway Trauma Center site
and as a part of the city for all negotiations the administration committed to funding three projects in
council district 31 $119 million for Tidal Gates and Mott Basin 65 million
for a Laurelton Rodale cloud burst management system and $10 million for the Brookville Park Recreation Center
does the administration remain committed to these investments in the fiscal 26 budget and I can repeat any question you
need me to okay um with the regarding the street
plans um I would defer to uh DOT uh in term of the operations um but do you
feel like they have enough funding we've been exempting engineers for them mhm uh so that they could have uh the resources
that they need uh to uh work on those plans so but again I would defer to them
but have they come back to you for additional funding at all come back they keep they come back to us for asking for
uh exemption to our engineers which we have been working with them to provide them so you've been approving what
they've been requesting but they've been requesting okay uh fairs we uh 200%
level we basically as you know we funded fair 145 in the executive budget we uh
um will work with the council as we get closer to adoption to see what can be done if the resources are available uh
the land transfer uh this is something I would work with you and look into it to see what can be done there and what the
other one is again um it was the city for all negotiation
funding commitments um for three particular things in district 31 i wanted to just commit understand if the
administration remains committed we're committed to fund everything in the city yes okay um but uh for the uh detail you
know for the specific program I'm probably going to come back to you with uh the answers thank you thank you chair
okay we have questions from Deputy Speaker Ayala followed by Majority Leader Faras
good morning still morning um my questions are regarding uh the asylum
seeker response but before I get to those I did see and I heard in your testimony um conversations about the
uh expansion of the on the budget for sanitation and I just wanted to
reiterate something that I've been bringing up in some of the other uh sanitation hearings that there hasn't
really been you know um real equity in the budget the way
that I don't know i I haven't been able to determine how it is that sanitation
um decides how much funding each district gets but in the district that I
represent and that some of my colleagues sitting here represent um we haven't really seen a decrease in garbage in the
way that we would have hoped to when we increase like you know the um litter basket removals it seems like we need
more resources you know we we have higher density we have a lot of social service needs um there's just a lot of
unusual circumstances that um they require additional resources and
a study on on that right um because we would love to be able to say that our communities are you know uh clean and
thriving and you know road proof as well but that's not the case and is is not a criticism but more of an observation and
you know hoping that finally I can get down to you know to the root of this and figure out what exactly is the
determining factor in um trying to balance out the budget in a way that is
truly equitable because if we all get a slice of the pizza but you already had two slices before you know I got there
then it's not equitable um I would defer to um DSNY for uh geographic resource
allocation and I would also communicate your concern to the commissioner as well
and it's not that they're not cleaning because I see them cleaning they're doing what what they're being asked to
do it's just not so it's not them is not enough whatever it is that we're doing
it's really not enough in in those communities i will definitely have my folks uh reach out to your office
perfect i really appreciate that okay all right um so regarding the asylum seeker response um help center uh
significant savings from the asylum seeker response efforts have been included in both the preliminary and executive plans this includes 2.7
billion in state funding across fiscal years 26 uh to 29 that was reflected on
as savings in the executive plan the administration indicated that the savings are due to the declining asylum
seeker census and a decline in in new entrance uh leaving actual expenditures below what had been previously projected
according to a recent New York Times article um due to the lack of state funding the city will be closing the
asylum applications help center which has assisted more than 109,000 applications with asylum and work
authorization in addition to other legal matters uh do we know what what was spent on operating the asylum
application help center in fiscal year 24 and 25 um and what sources supported
the center what funding sources yeah the funding sources is coming from the state uh the actual spending I would provide
it I would you have it the actual well go ahead about about uh
49 million in FY25 and 24
around 40 so roughly the same there wasn't a lot there wasn't much change
roughly is that correct well it's 40 versus 49
So 40 41 okay no it's 40 in in 24 oh or 48 49 in 25 so Okay I heard it wrong
almost 20% higher great perfect um why is the city closing the asylum um
application help center because he was funded by the state you know and the funding dries up all right aren't there
still considerable number of people in the city that are that are requiring um this type of assistance and what is the
city's transition plan to continue to address this need after the center is closed we believe Moya would uh uh
continue to provide uh uh asylum seeker services particular legal services
u many of them with ghetto services to moya do they have additional funding resources we funded Moya we had about
like $42 million okay in fiscal year 26
okay um the governor's office obviously has indicated that the state has already
allocated 4.3 billion over the past two years for the city's asylum seeker response efforts one of the reasons that
she cites for not allocating additional funding is that the city has only drawn down 1.6 billion of the funds that were
allocated can you tell us how much of the 4.3 billion from the state has uh the city spent to date and how much has
been submitted for reimbursement okay the uh as I said this is an excuse
uh to be quite honest with you because uh the um the first billion dollars that the
state for us it was so cumbersome to uh basically get uh for us to put the
claims in because don't forget they only funded one/ird so therefore for that $1 billion we had to put in that $3 billion
of paid invoices okay okay so it takes time okay to get $3 billion for you to
get a billion dollars we could claim so it was process was so bad that they still changed it when they the following
year and they start giving us uh uh advances um so um we I believe how much
we have claimed so far uh we had they advanced us about 1.25 billion
uh to date of the 2.06 uh 06 uh billion
dollars and uh for the fundings that was committed uh by New York State for the
Randles Fy Bennett Field and Quidmmore uh we're in the process of submitting claims and awaiting approval from New
York State on the execution of contract and claiming plans that we submitted to
the state so it is uh as I said it's a purely excuse it's a process because you know
and it's not $4.3 billion that was given directly to the city i believe it's about like $2.6 billion that was given
to a city directly everything else was for other costs that the state uh uh uh
was paying for other things that uh in ter of their own so the delays been is is due to a cumbersome process
cumbersome process you know requirements that they have and it was so bad that
they even changed the entire process the second time around when they reappropriate money for us the uh the
following year so are we on track to receive the the the remaining portion we we we getting we're getting we're
getting all the claims is coming in they're getting all the claims because again as I said we have to get invoice first pay those invoices and then submit
those invoices it takes time so it is just an excuse because we are we are you know our budget is based on a core basis
so we don't have to get the cash to recognize them right away in our books so it is just uh as I said it's you know
it's they wanted to cut it they cut it and it's looking for ways to explain that hey you're not claiming as much as
you you should so therefore we're going to stop it listen the state gave us a
billion dollars when we had 20,000 people in our care yes we have 40 close to 40,000 does it make any sense to say
you're going to cut funding at this point in time but it's also pretty at 20 you give us a billion dollars at 40
you're saying you don't need it anymore it makes no sense no I understand what you're saying i just I find it unusual
that the state is citing that their reduction in um budget lines for spec
you know for for this the cost of asylum seekers due to the fact that we have all
of this extra money knowing that the reason that the money hasn't come in is because of the you know the the the way
that the process was laid out was made it more complicated to do that so it almost feels like you're being penalized
for something that was out of your control okay exactly all right so could you
could you just repeat um how was what was the uh the amount spent today of the
4.3 no they didn't give us 4.3 they as I said to you directly they gave us 2.6
2.6 okay um the money is already spent okay it's already spent already spent we
spent $7.7 billion as of last month and if you include this month after $200
million you're talking about $7.9 billion okay that we did not plan on
spending no understood okay it's already spent it's just a question of claiming the money we claim so far $1.25 billion
and we're in a process for submitting more claims to them okay thank you
[Music] um in the preliminary plan 1.43 for
three billion in fiscal year 26 was transferred from DHS's budget to other city agencies that the administration
projected would be involved in asylum seeker response efforts in the executive plan 781.5 million was transferred back
to DHS from other uh agencies for fiscal year 26
why were the um these funds shifts why why were these funding um shifts between
DHS and other city agencies made in the preliminary plan and why were these shifts partially rescended in the
executive uh prior to the preliminary plan uh all asylum seeker funding was kept in the uh
DHS uh budget in the outs uh because uh there was uh no cost
forecast yet for fiscal year 26 and the outers uh in the asylum in the preliminary plan
we published an asylum seek forecast for 26 we projected cost of $2.6 $6 billion
so therefore we had to reallocate resources uh uh to uh across agencies based on the
state uh of uh of our operations at that time
do you does the administration expect that DHS is going to fully take over the city's asylum seeker response efforts in fiscal year 26 and beyond the goal is to
consolidate okay okay if uh do you know when and and
and what the transition plan is yeah we they in a transition we're in a
transition to do this and uh our goal is um uh we on track to close all but four
non DHS sites by July 1st okay and um so you know and
thereafter we begin to cons you know the consolidation of all uh the uh migrant
into one system okay um while the executive plan includes an additional 36.1 million bringing the CFC
um fiscal budget fiscal 2026 budget um up to 57 million it is not enough to
address the critical need of this program food pantries and soup kitchens are often the only choice for some of
our city's most vulnerable residents which is why the council has long supported and pushed for the expansion of this program i'm still concerned that
the funding was not baseline or increased to meet the growing need in fiscal year 26 and beyond the threat and
actuality of federal funding cuts has already impacted the provider network and will cause food pantries to rely
more heavily on CFC and city funding as part of the fiscical year 26 preliminary budget response the council called on
the administration to add 79.1 million in CFC baseline to both restore one-time
fun uh funding in fiscal year 25 and to expand the annual budget for program to
100 million in the general welfare executive budget hearing H testified that the agency would work closely with
OM on adjusting CFC funding what is the actual spending thus far in fiscal year
25 for CFC and how much was spent in fiscal year 24 um for fiscal year 26 we
added u 36 million for 700 community kitchens and food pantries citywide um
uh program connection with the community food uh connection uh program so we have
a budget of more than $50 million we also added $10 million in fiscally 26
for the go to go program again as I said uh we know as uh we get closer to
adoption be more than happy to work with you and council uh to see uh what can be
done if uh you know if we believe that there's a budget need we will try to
work with you and the council to see what can be done yeah but we added some
um from our perspective some significant resources in the executive budget it's about over $50 million right now yeah
the the food pantry i know that yeah the lines have gotten so long i mean even
way past the you know beginning of the the pandemic um when we expected that
they would decrease they've only gotten bigger you know longer um I I have one around the corner from
where I live and I in that line used to you know never made it to my building and is actually surpassing my building
at this point um which is a sight to see you know it's really um it's
heartbreaking but at the same time you know so grateful that those resources do exist to help New Yorkers that really
desperately need them um so is is the analysis of of need um that OMB has done
to assess the budget sufficient or is conversations with OM being had with H
regarding this we we we'll have a discussion with Char but again we kept the budget at the same level that we had
last year so is there any intention to baseline at any point again if uh we
could identify long-term funding we will always try to uh do the right thing but
again as I said you know we it's not easy to find long-term funding source to
baseline all the programs that uh from our perspective need to be baseline so we have to take each one program at a
time and see what can be done and if the resources are there we try to do the right thing i know it's not an easy
position to be in um over the past several years DSS has
underbudgeted for key entitlement programs funded through both DHS and HR there has been a misalignment between
the adopted budgets for these programs and the actual year-end expenditures for cash assistance city fees non-assign
seeker shelter costs and house uh housing considerable amounts of additional funding are uh typically
added throughout the fiscal year to meet the demand for the programs during the fiscal uh year 2026 executive budget
hearing for the committee on general welfare DSS informed us that they were working closely with OM to look at the
baseline and project um and and project uh the level of need for these programs
uh can you explain how OM works with the SS to project the budget needs for um
crucial entitlement programs and how are actual expenditures in prior fiscal years considered in this analysis and
budgeting for future years yeah we um we review different factors when we trying
to analyze the need uh for these programs it's not just prior year
spending we look at the ongoing trend current case load policy changes so we
look at a number of factors when we make uh those uh consideration um but again
we always in close discussion with the agencies
uh to make sure that uh to review the needs of the program on ongoing basis
and keep adding resources as needed okay so we will continue to do the same thing
that we've been doing in the past uh to make sure that the programs are you know are well funded appropriately funded
okay so I'm assuming that you're having ongoing conversations on on the budgeting
matters throughout the year okay um does OMB anticipate uh reforming the
projections techniques to accurately budget for for vital programs to match the level of need or is it more of a
funding it's again as I said we look at different factors and and we are in
constant communication with the agencies to monitor the trend to look at the case load policy changes that they
implementing what are the ramification of policy changes so we look at a bunch of factors as uh we examine access these
programs and but more importantly we're in constant communication with the agencies and throughout the year we mark
their budget okay to make sure that they have the resources to address the needs that they you're comfortable then with
the current um technique that you uses okay okay thank you so much thank you
okay we've been joined by Council Member Abrau on Zoom and now we have questions from Majority Leader Faras followed by
Council Member Carr thank you Chair good morning everyone
i'd like to begin um with some maternal health questions in our budget response the council called on the administration
to provide 15.7 million in additional baseline funding starting fiscal year
2026 to support maternal health programs and services these include the maternity
infant reproduction program newborn home visiting program nurse family partnership and universal home visiting
program given the critical services that these programs provide to women and families why was no additional funding
added to the executive budget to further support maternal health programs um currently we have uh uh I believe 34
uh million dollars um and um this funding alone is allow over 12,000 uh
additional families to receive uh these services we will continue to um monitor the needs
and we'll work with the council if uh there are additional needs uh to be addressed and as I said as we move
toward adoption if resources are available we'll uh you know look at the needs to see if there is do an
assessment needs needs assessment if they the needs are there and resources are available we will have a discussion
with the council we'd like to have those discussions I mean maternal health has not improved over several years
explicitly for black women in New York City and I'm sure across the tri burough
state as well but we know that there's an excessive need so we you know I personally would like to know if you
could commit to reviewing the budget for these programs for the adoption and commit for additional funding
as I said you know we uh will work uh with the council and um and if resources
are available we'll have a discussion about uh what needs to be done okay and then how does this decision align with
the goal of healthy NYC to reduce maternal deaths in New York City and pro and improve family health out incomes if
we're just going to continue conversations and review we know we've assessed in the past that we have a high
need in New York City it's not just conversation as I said we added in the in the plan we have $34 million added
so it's not just words we they added we we adding resources uh to these programs
however if there's you know if there are more needs uh and resources are available as we go get to close closer
to adoption we will have a discussion about you know if there are additional needs we will try to address them okay
i'm sure the council and the speaker on you know we'll continue the conversations with you as this is a
priority for us and the council um I have some questions on New York City tourism and conventions we anticipate
that the number of tourists visiting the city in the current year will trail 2024's 64.1 million level um NYCTC
estimates that the city will have 400,000 more domestic travelers than last year but 800,000 fewer foreign
travelers clearly the Trump administration's policies are somewhat to blame for this downturn but in light
of that the city should be doing everything possible we can to support tourism yet in the executive plan the
administration only partially restored 3 million to cuts to NYC tourism and convention the preliminary plan included
20 million for EDC to support World Cup marketing and quote unquote fan events
could the administration repurpose some of this funding for New York City tourism and conventions in fiscal year
26 considering the overlap in purpose and goals uh that was a commitment I already made
to the uh uh to FIFA uh world cup to bring uh the um world cup uh uh to the
um um to the city um but again we will uh
again continue to work with uh um uh tourism and New York City tourism and
conventions and um you know they have revised down their forecast uh of uh uh
tourism for fisc for 2025 basically based on the projection of a decrease in
international travel and uh if we believe there is a need for them to um
ramp up their campaign overseas we will work with them okay i mean yesterday
many of us in the council and I'm sure other folks in the administration received an email from president and CEO
Julie Coker explicitly stating that 700 plus members of NYCTC
um support the FY26 ask um they're stating that if with without the full
restoration of the 7 million allocation they'll be forced to scale back its global marketing reach and campaign
burrowwide community marketing programs and beyond and as we know the burrowwide
campaigns are the ones that produce local small economy boosts in our commercial corridors and so will the
administration restore the full 7 million for New York City tourism and convention in the adopted plan huh the
total amount that went in this plan was $3 million but over the course of uh the
year the amount that's been added to tourism is $3.5 million so the FY26
value ends up being 21.6 million which is basically the baseline level so from
our perspective they're restored understand that they still perceive a need in terms of global markets and
we'll continue to work with them um going forward well we had a cut last budget that wasn't restored at the end
of FY25 and we're looking now at an even more with tariffs federal level
conversations we're seeing a decrease in turnout in our tourism which will then decrease the revenue generated in the
city and impact our economy so if you're saying you're going to have conversations with NYCTC on what their
needs are and assess how we're going to help support them and really support this city and the tri-state area and the
state quite frankly with the revenue that we generate from New York City alone um that would mean that you could
commit to re reinstating their $7 million to ensure that they're fully funded and baselined
in terms of restoring them um just looking at their current level they're fully restored um okay but again
understand again again we understand the challenge again what Supreme is making i
believe we restored it last last last You partially restored it last time i'm still the chair of the committee yeah so
uh but again we will continue to work with them as I said if they have a plan to tackle international tourism and to
try to bring tours uh to New York City we'll work with them to see what can be done i'll make sure to follow up with
NYCTC and make sure they express what their spreadsheet says in the books and why they need the 7 million and I'll
make sure to follow up with you folks sure thank you chairs thank you folks thank you uh OM has requested just a
quick bathroom break we'll take a 10-minute break and we'll continue with Council Member Carr followed by Lewis
turn the mic turn the mic
good morning good morning could I have everybody go back to their seats we're going starting momentarily also there's
no food or drinking in the chambers and no one may approach the deis thank you
[Applause] okay we're going to resume now with questions from Council Member Carr
followed by Council Member Lewis thank you Chair Director good to see you and your team as always thanks for being
here and answering our questions um I want to talk about road resurfacing um in the fiscal year 2024 uh the mayor's
preliminary management report indicated that DOT surfaced 1,177 lane miles that fiscal year
including bike lane miles about shakes out to about $200,000 a mile just a
little under that and in the preliminary budget response the council asked for an additional $40 million for road
resurfacing in order to return us to the 1300 lane mile budgeted target that we
used to have uh prior to fiscal year 2020 and as we've discussed in the past that was reduced to,00 lane miles
because of the fiscal realities induced by the pandemic we're many years removed from that now and I'm wondering why we
have not returned to the 1300 lane mile target given that it is an imperative if I think anyone who uses our roads
whether it's a cyclist or a driver can tell you that or a bus commuter for that matter and we'd like to know what
increase if any has been in the executive plan for lane miles uh and is it in capital or expense funding if so
yeah we are baseline funding for,00 miles 100 miles lane miles in the um and
50 bike lane uh miles in the um a few years ago
um again it's
um it's a capacity issue uh from what we understand based on our discussion with
DOT they have uh the capacity issue in terms of uh you know the
um labor they have a bunch of challenges that they have to uh address uh
materials and equipments Um but again we will uh I'll have a conversation with
them again okay to see um you know whether or not the um these things those
concerns can be addressed and if they can be addressed you know we will have a
discussion i think they can because when Commissioner Rodriguez and DOT testified here I asked them this question and they
indicated a capacity and a willingness to return to the 1300 lane mile standard and I think if we commit to that even in
the out years then it makes their planning processes easier i'd have a discussion with him appreciate that um
I'd like to move on to curbside e-waste um that was previously a pilot program that we had in Staten Island for uh the
pickup of electronic waste um which can no longer be landfilled unlike the rest of the city or large parts of it we do
not benefit from the ecycle program which services buildings with uh at least 10 units or more um and it's a
$3.5 million program that was cut in the last fiscal year and I'm asking that it
be restored uh is that something that can be explored as we reach the conclusion of this year's budget process
yeah the challenge we have is uh the efficiency of that program again I'll
have a discussion again with the commission s the um sanition commissioner but the challenge we had
was uh um we collect very little tonnage out of this program and so you know you know can you
want to add to it but is well I think I think that was true because originally the program was supposed to be expanded
yet another casualty of the co budget situation um and I think if we had scaled up as we intended to the other
burrows we would have gotten to the tonnage needed and so I think the first step towards getting back to a city-wide
program is restoring the the pilot in Staten Island the tonnage is has been
really low on that program and you know the efficiency is to is to have uh the
drop off sites right which we've done and uh you know I my understanding is that there are drop off sites uh
available on Staten Island so that uh we can pick up this waste in a in a more efficient manner well there are drop off
sites but the again it's a question of equity right you have a program in which there is pickup service for higher
density communities and you have lower density communities across the five burrows uh that are not getting the
benefit of that service so I think to say like oh well just drop them off in the one site we have in Staten Island
where they could be dropped off and I know there's popup events but it's really not sufficient to meet the need
so if the issue is efficiency then let's talk about actually scaling the program up citywide like was actually intended
rather than not restarting it at all okay as I said we'll have a conversation
with the commissioner thank you director thank you chair okay we have questions from Council Member Lewis followed by
Williams thank you Chair and good afternoon Director Jiha and your team i
have three quick questions um is our in our council preliminary budget response
we urge the administration to allocate an additional five million to health and hospitals to provide at least one
maternal health focused psychologists within each of its maternity departments i'm concerned about why this request
remains ignored in this executive budget and to what extent will this be
maintained in the outy years second question is in regards to uh the women
forward NYC action plan mayor Adams women forward action plan was a step in the right direction to position New York
City as a national leader in gender equity with an allocation of 43 million
which is a mixture of city and private funding given the proven success and demand for young women's leadership and
development I wanted to know if OM could share with us at least in the city's portion of the 43 million if that would
be increased or at minimum baselined in in the city's portion of women's women
forward NYC and my last question is how does the executive plan address the anticipated rise in discrimination
complaints due to the Trump administration's executive orders the preliminary budget response called for
15 million to be distributed to nonprofit organizations that provide gender affirming care can we expect this
funding to be added to the adoption yeah
um currently uh um H&H when it comes to the uh uh issue uh regarding uh maternal
uh health focus psychologist um H&H from what we understand is
accommodating all patients who need uh this kind of uh
treatment um and uh but again the challenge we all have is uh the
difficulty in term of hiring psychologists because it's not easy you
know because everybody's competing for the same uh but does that mean the 5 million can't be added to the budget or
at minimum a portion of it again as I said we will work with H&H
and see whether or not they believe they need additional resources because from their perspective uh they believe that
they um uh try to accommodate as best as they can the patients but uh if uh again
as part of our discussion with them we'll we'll get a sense you know of uh um what they think they need if there is
a need and we'll come back to you well Dr catz was here for the executive budget hearing and I believe that it's a
need so maybe we all should have a conversation with him okay about how they'll accomplish that regarding Women Forward NYC of the 43 million that the
city has allocated towards that is that going to be baseline are they adding more to that
uh is it baseline no uh is it no I don't know i will get
back to you on this because I don't know if it's baseline or not i will get back to you the 15 million for the nonprofits
for gender affirming care
again we'll come back to you with an answer to this thank you thank you chair
want to welcome PS16 from Council Member Moya's district in Queens thanks for joining us
guys if you have any questions for uh budget chair Jih you let us
know just text me uh now we have questions from Council Member Williams followed by Rustler
thank you um the Commission on Racial Equity requested funding for five
additional staff lines so that they could fulfill their mandates these lines were not included in the plan and CORE
continues to be understaffed um why wasn't the additional funding provided
in the plan for core staffing needs
um we've been uh increasing uh the budget uh uh we've been working with
core we added $2 million in fiscal year 26 and $1.8 million in in TPS funding
during the November plan uh in addition uh we added
$429,000 for for staff in the baseline in the general plan uh for supplemental
staffing the budget right now is like $2.4 million in fiscal year 25 and 4.8
in 26 so uh we've been making uh you know uh
investment into that agency so one of the issues of course is this
two for one hire thing so are you willing to work with them to exempt them
so they can quickly fill the empty staff line and then I know they also requested to roll over the leftover funds um to
allow them to actually hire a GC and a communications
um consultant to fulfill uh some of their mandate so will you allow them to also roll over
their funds um we've been working with them and I from what I understand they are exempted uh from the freeze you said
they are yeah so okay but again I will have a I mean know I have uh um discussion with staff but uh as far as
um we know they are exempted uh from the freeze okay um moving to
CCHR um I think we all know what they're responsible for the council call for the
administration to provide an additional $6 million and the exact plan um and I
know when we had our briefing you mentioned that you had given CCHR um
more funds but it does not seem like that's the case so how does OMB plan to
support CCHR especially in this federal climate um where there appears to be a
lot of focus on reducing the scope of uh people's civil and human rights
i I believe we added in the general plan uh uh resources to their budget uh in
the general plan by like some $556,000 so they could hire uh five uh
folks uh to increase their source of income in their source of income discrimination unit
yeah I know that the request was 6 million and source of income is very important and I know the council has
done a lot of work with the administration on it but there's so many other things that CCHR does or is unable
to do because they don't have the funds to do it for instance the fair housing um act is coming into effect and that
will impact how people are able to get homes and apartments and I don't think
that CCHR has the resources to really enforce that law um again the federal
climate has created more opportunities in a good way for people to seek some
type of reprieve at the local level but I just I just don't think they have the resources to enforce and proactively
educate people around um civil and human rights discrimination and laws that
protect folks in New York City again as I said we will work with them because currently they have a 33
vacancies okay it's just a question of you know hiring those attorneys but we will work with them uh we met with them
and I just want to add it's not just I'm not just seeking um resources for attorneys just even in like their
marketing budget like in previous years um when uh certain things went into
effect I think it was the you know don't don't ask don't tell around the um when
people are applying for jobs whether or not they had a criminal record they did extensive marketing around that law
going into effect but as far as I know they don't have the resources to do robust outreach and marketing around the
city's laws so that people can comply and they don't get fines um So not just
for the legal division but also as a whole um okay last question the mayor's
office equity and racial justice has still not released their preliminary 2024 racial equity plan it's probably I
don't know 400 days late at this point uh which was required um back October
2024 which was push back date one focus of the plan is to help ensure equity is
being considered when formulating the city's budget so what support is OM OM
providing MORJ to ensure the plan is released have you received a copy of the report have you taken any consideration
if you have to the current budget year um and we really only have like a month
left so do you anticipate utilizing this plan in any way um as we move forward in
finalizing fiscal 2026 budget uh I would defer to city hall when it comes to the
question regarding the plan the equity plan uh but again as I said we've been working with them we give them our
feedback on their plan and uh but uh in ter of the release of the plan I would
defer to uh uh city hall because it hasn't been released though and I know the plan is circulating within the
administration do you plan to or have you taken any consideration to this current fiscal
budget as the plan may call or not call for you to do so we always every
decision we make as part of the budget we do them through an equity lens
okay i mean you could see as you could see in the budget we make so many investment and many of the investment as
I said we basically look at them from that perspective so as far as I'm we are
concerned uh we understand what the plan is trying to accomplish but this is
something that we do currently council member Moya
thank you thank you chair sorry for the interruption i just wanted to personally give a shout out to PS16
uh and the civics class that is here today from my district uh thank you to
Miss Amont and also to Mr feldman uh who are here this group uh approached me a
while back and said well what does a council member do uh and I said the best thing they can do is come on tour and
see what's happening and they're seeing how government uh really runs except for James who ill-advisedly came here
wearing a Real Madrid jersey um and uh you know we won't get into that but
thank you so much welcome everyone to the people's house thank you Chair okay questions from Council Member Wrestler
followed by Joseph thank you Chair Brandon i just want to take a second to commend you on doing a
great job through this round of executive budget hearings and and I really want to thank the the whole council finance staff who have been
terrific um good to see you Director Jiha and team see you too um a few
questions just could I couldn't pin you down i couldn't hear in your back and forth with Speaker Adams a number do you
have a number of how much funding you're planning to add on childcare vouchers in the adopted budget uh it's $328 million
you'll be adding $328 million and will that amount allow for will that amount ensure that we are
funded to get the full dollar for-dollar match that the state has afforded us yep that's the uh that's the MOE great thank
you very much so you're that will be in the adopted budget good answer um thank
you uh I love straight answers um I want to move to burrow-based jails uh the
mayor recently proposed uh converting the Brooklyn Buroughbased jail facility into a mental health
facility um and converting the other three sites into housing um is this
proposal seriously being considered by OMB say it again confidence the mayor made
the mayor you know the mayor being the mayor uh said that he wanted to convert the Brooklyn jail project into a mental
health facility and the other three jail sites into housing is OMB seriously considering this proposal as far as we
are concerned everything is going as uh as planned as planned that is such two
for two we're doing great this morning um okay so I just want to
Just because I think it's helpful do you have a sense of how much money has been spent on the Buroughbased jail plan to
date uh to date now hundreds of millions of dollars are we over a billion we um I
know for sure we budgeted 16 billion dollars for total total i just But the burn rate the burn rate in Brooklyn
we're spending tens of millions of dollars a month in Brooklyn alone we now have multiple I would come back to you with an answer on the specific on the
specific uh dramatic I mean we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this project to date we are we have signed
contracts with vendors at each of these sites sure um I'm glad that we are moving ahead as planned and that
whatever the mayor may have been musing about does not seem to be changing the direction of the administration
um the Brooklyn buroughbased jail is supposed to be done in 2029 the other burrows are supposed to be completed in
what years 20 31 31 32 we're in that range so we're still more than 5 years
out from when we're going to complete the plan according to the current timelines that would give us a 5year
capital lifespan window to continue to do work on Riker's Island to make necessary improvements to the crumbling
infrastructure do you believe that it would be beneficial for DOC to apply for a waiver from the controllers's office
and I guess from all of you under directive 10 to wave the to to potentially uh pursue capital
eligibility for projects on Riker's Island i think the concept should change the law from 2027 because that's what
that's what's the problem the waiver is but there's an alternative process the waiver could be per pursued as long as
the 2027 uh law is on the book i mean I would I could talk to the lawyers but as far as I'm concerned as long as the 2027
law is in the book we we are limited to what we can do because we're in 2025
right now so you know it's like only two years so you know concept could change I
mean there but there is an alternative we're not changing it but there is I mean without a serious conversation with this administration um there is which we
have not yet had uh there is a mechanism though that you could pursue a waiver to
pursue for capital discuss it I'll discuss it with the We appreciate you considering it uh Litman Commission were
the Litman Commission 2.0's funding recommendations considered in the crafting of the executive plan yes we
added uh um resources to fund a lot of programs dealing with uh alternative to
incarceration and did you discuss these recommendations with the Litman Commission prior to releasing the executive plan
uh no no but uh we had uh you know we met with them and they gave us a
briefing in terms of uh what the recommendations uh uh will be and we
listen to them and we take them into account last one for me and um thank you
for the modest amount of extended time have you done an updated analysis on the
loss of funding to New York State since on uh the impact of the Republican House bill that passed last week uh we
continue to do our own assessment of uh the bill because as as you I'm pretty sure you know that uh this is not the
final okay could you do you have a number on what your expectation is for
how much lo how much funding would be lost to New York State no approximately $15 billion we don't we don't have we
don't have yet a full bill to do you know full assessment of the entire uh
because we have to wait for the Senate we certainly don't have a bill that's passed both chambers but we have a a
bill that would be catastrophic if it were passed it's a $15 billion loss in funding to the state of New York that
would be very that would be very extremely difficult for New York City to to absorb and is this
is OM aggressively advocating for changes around Medicaid and food stamps
in particular to protect low and moderate income New Yorkers immigrant New Yorkers we uh basically as I said
earlier we uh will fight for every federal dollar
that New Yorkers deserve okay as I said New Yorkers paid their
fair share of federal taxes okay and they should not be penalized yeah
because the city is following state and
city laws i appreciate that i think you've spent many distinguished years in
government at the state level at the city level um I can't imagine that you've ever seen a bill come out of
Washington that would be so catastrophic to the budget of New York State and New
York City as what the House just passed a $15 billion cut in funding to the state of New York more than 5% of their
budget would have broad ramifications on our abilities to fund parks and public safety and school and education early
childhood education and hospitals and more it would the the the scale of the
devastation that this bill would have on vulnerable New Yorkers and on everything
that we care about really can't be understated and so I've appreciated that we've had Molly Park and Mitch Katz and
some of the leaders in this administration speak up about just how catastrophic this would be but we've
heard crickets from the other side of city hall and I know that you get how bad this would be for our budget and
that it would lead to horrible decisions that we do not want to make uh and cuts that we desperately want to avoid and I
hope the mayor starts to listen and get with the program as well because his voice matters here and it would be a helpful thing for him to advocate for
the needs of New Yorkers thank you very much the mayor has continued to advocate for New Yorkers and he will continue
will continue to fight for New Yorkers questions from council member Joseph
followed by Salam thank you chairs um good to see you
commissioner always um so in our in our we understand that New York City public
schools application for Head Start is pending approval at the federal level so we'd like to clarify the changing Head
Start landscape in fiscal 2026 um given the uncertainty and the timing of the approval what is OMBB's plan to ensure
continuation of care in Head Start um and if New York City public schools only
receive partial federal funding or does not receive the grant what is OMB's commitment to stabilizing the Head Start
system and how will that impact the current Head Starts um providers i'm going to ask all my questions at once
because I know my time is limited so when is the latest um OM can recognize federal funding for Head Start in fiscal
2026 without any operational issues um regardless of funding changes in Head
Start for fiscal 2026 can you also explain why OMB is certain that every eligible child that wants a Head Start
seat of any age 0 to four will get one in 2026 and of course special education
um New York City public school also told us about 7,000 students with IEPs were not being provided with one or more of
their mandated services while you baseline $55 million for preschool special education classrooms in the
executive plan so what's the conversation with OM about DOE's new
need um submission for additional funding for preschool special education
how much are they requesting and what's the headcount and why OMB hasn't added any additional funding for preschool
special education services um uh regarding her head start um the um
mayor made a commitment Mhm that uh uh the services are so critical
uh for New Yorkers that uh even in the absence of uh federal funding the city
would step in he made that announcement about I think a month ago you know so he
made that commitment so right now I can't tell you whether or not we're going to get partial funding or whatever
we're going to get but the deal is he made the commitment that But you've also applied for fewer um seats he he applies
for you know so his goal is to make sure that if we seats who need a seats get a
seat you know so again as I said that's a commitment that they already made so therefore it's not going to back away uh
from uh that commitment um special education we added an
additional $555 million like we stated uh in the plan um and uh we will
continue as again as I said um we have we we have uh some discussion and I
believe I'm meeting with the um ten store next week uh to discuss our
priorities okay and as we discuss our priorities I will listen to her and see what she brings to us but what about the
students who have not received none of their services um so we were asking for 70 million in the budget for that we
didn't see that um 70 million for related services you still have about
7,000 students that have not received their mandated services and you know what that leads to our Carter cases that
we constantly fight against and push against so that's why I'm asking okay as I said we I'm meeting with the
chancellor next week and we'll have a discussion about her needs what the priorities are but in the Head Start you
applied for 3,500 fewer Head Start seats for three year olds and four year olds while you age down so does that result
in a decrease for capacity for three and four year olds we will backfill you're going to backfill may I make that
commitment chairs um LGBTQ um plus IA inclusive curriculum we
noticed in the executive plan there was an additional 2.48 million um to fund the LGBTQ plus curriculum this covers
the DOE contract CBO and initiative but the additional 315 through through DYCD
was not funded in the executive why wasn't the funding added to the DCY um DYCD budget in the
executive plan and does OM commit to fully funding the LGBTQ plus IIA
curriculum in 2026 again we will discuss it as part of uh
uh adoption uh process and uh we'll see what we learn you get in in our Ames and
Horizon seats and that's for our autistic learners oh I'm going to get it all in you know
I'm here for the kids so I have to find out because we know that will also reduce our having our horizons nest that
will also reduce our Carter cases that are ballooning sure is that a commitment on the record that
that we will be funding these programs what I say is we'll continue we'll have discussion with the council as uh we
approach adoption and if resources are available we'll discuss the needs more aim seats more nest seats and more
horizon got it thank you thank you chairs council members we've been joined
by council member Sanchez on zoom now we have questions from council member Salam followed by Hudson
good afternoon and thank you director Jiha great to see you and your team good to see you sir thank you
chair so there's a michelama development in my district espanard gardens in
significant need significant need of financial and structural attention and
the residents have been trying to address this since superstar s supererstorm Sandy i want to know how is
OM accounting for Harlem's growing housing and infrastructure needs within the capital plan especially in light of
historical low capital commitment rates in black and brown neighborhoods
um I'm not aware of this one you aware of it the specific we'll have to work
with HPD on the specific development but as it pertains to how we're accounting for Harlem's growing needs we largely
defer to HPD to come up with the program and work with them on the funding of the program which takes into account equity
issues as well as uh various housing needs throughout the bureaus why don't you give us the information
we'll work with your office and get a better sense of that particular project sure okay given that Harlem has one of
the highest concentrations of NICE units what share of the 1 $14.5 million in restored
funding for older adults older adult services is being directed to Nicha's senior centers or naturally occurring
resident communities in Harlem and just for background on in uh on 2201 Adam
Clay Pal Jr boulevard in January 2024 the city announced plans to establish a sanctuary shelter for families at this
particular location the facility was to include approximately 54 rooms operated by the Department of Homeless Services
in partnership with the Children's Rescue Fund a contract provider however the
community raised concerns very very serious concerns about this plan and it was ultimately altered currently the
administration has renew their mission to house shelter families at this location i now find myself along with
many of my colleagues in wondering why the administration has not communicated this with local communities on how they
intend to provide for shelter sheltering these families
okay um in in this plan we added about $81
million uh to deal with some cliffs that uh uh DIA had
uh but regarding the shelter of that particular one you know anything about it that again we'll come
back to you on the specific one because uh this is not on our radar at all okay
we work with our office to get more information on this well thank you
Council Member Hudson thank you so much
um as you know but I'm always going to share the statistics older adults represent 20% of the city's population a
2021 CUNI Graduate Center study reports that the population of adults ages 65
and older in New York State will soar 25% between 2021 and 2040 in the city
alone the population of older adults is expected to increase by 40% by the year 2040 despite the growth in the city's
older adult population and the increased need for resources to repair deteriorating infrastructure NYC aging's
capital budget totals only $85.1 million between fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2029 in
the executive commitment plan was any capital funding added in the executive commitment plan to support NYC aging's
capital needs especially at older adult centers uh as you know in this plan we uh added
uh uh $81 million uh to deal with the uh cliffs and uh we also added 20 almost
$21 million uh for the um restoration of the peg that we have in addition
um we added uh almost $20 million to address the indirect rate sorry 20
million for what the injur rate needed by providers
um it's um this issue about capital needs uh uh
for DIA uh has not been uh brought uh to my attention and I will work with the
commissioner to find out exactly what this is um but um you know I'm I'm not sure
because Okay so I will get back to you after I talk to her to find out exactly what uh the needs are okay so it sounds
like they didn't specifically request any additional capital funding as far as I know i don't know about the staff okay
um do you believe that the current level of capital funding is sufficient given the growing older adult population and
the extensive provider network NYC aging manages again if I don't see the need if they if
they don't discuss the needs with us you know they have to come to us with needs and discuss them but I have not seen
something that's more like on the expense side okay capital budget is very small it is okay that's my point and
yeah it's very small but uh you know the um the their expense budget we try to as
best as we can to take care of all the needs yeah and
listen that money is great i don't want you to touch that money i wanted to just
uh address the the capital needs yeah i do appreciate that um and even when
we're we're given a lot there's always more needed especially given the population increase that we're expecting
in the next 15 years um but let me just move on uh quickly to homed delivered
meals um the council's fiscal 2026 preliminary budget response called on the
administration to add and baseline 7.3 million for the home delivered meals program to bring the per meal
reimbursement rate up to $15.31 from $13.78 to fully cover the actual cost of
food at adoption last year 4.8 million was added in baseline starting in fiscal 2025 to increase reimbursement rates for
homed delivered meals from $12.78 to $13.78 the additional funding for a
reimbursement rate increase for fiscal 2026 was not included in the executive plan we learned at the executive budget
hearing that NYC aging has also been advocating for an increase to me and reimbursement rates and I'd like to know
if OM plans to include this in the adopted plan and if so what reimbursement rate increase will be
included and how much would such an increase cost yeah we continue to work with uh Jifa uh to um uh review the
ongoing needs and around food and are open to um further
discussion uh in the as part of the adopted budget process okay we're we
like an openness to continued discussion so I'll take that um has OMB considered
permitting a different reimbursement rate for meals that meet the cultural needs and the needs of those with
specific health conditions which typically typically cost more than an average meal
again we will have discussion with Jifa okay see uh you know what what the
difference in terms of the variance in term of cost and we'll review accordingly and uh you know Okay i'll be
sure to follow up but I just want to make sure that we're also as part of that conversation um under thoroughly understanding the
the needs for different types of meals and the costs that are associated with that thank you thank you chairs okay
questions council member Brewer followed by Riley thank you very much um my first question is about the department of
investigation in our preliminary response the council requested that the executive include an
additional three million in baseline for DOI to hire 13 additional personnel and
cover a shortfall of their funding for 22 existing vacancies the funding was
not in the exec and why was it not provided in light of DOI's mandated
responsibilities and there will there be additional funding in the adopted plan i know sometimes you say because they
haven't filled their positions i I know I could almost give you the answer however it's my feeling strongly that
they are working hard to fill those positions they need the extra funding because of all of the extra
opportunities that's the if that's the right word to uh make sure there's no fraud and other improprieties in our uh
administration and the thing is if they don't have the funding then they don't have the ability to do the extra hiring
that would enable them to do the oversight yeah and um I understand uh your concern
and uh um we um we've been working with them in the preliminary plan uh we gave
them about $750,000 so they could hire 10 uh folks
so that could build their investigative staff and support staff uh in addition we made uh some salary
adjustment uh for them to assist them to help them with retention of certain
position we are currently working with them and I believe we just approve some
PS uh for them okay and that would be
reflected uh in adoption at adoption uh but we're working with them const you
know on a day-to-day basis to u make sure that they have the resources that they need to uh take advantage of the
opportunities like we word it uh that is uh you know open to them okay i mean I I
would say we keep pushing on that issue because they've been using some of their assets for your money which is not what it's supposed to be used for yeah but we
as I said we we working with them and I believe last week we provided them some approval okay okay we'll keep pushing
yep um next issue of course at the Department of Education there's also a DOI office not part of the DOI citywide
and that has only like a $6 million uh budget um and it's called SCI school uh
and the issue is they have 55 staff members for a uh agency that's got a $40
billion budget and 140,000 uh person uh staffing so my question is maybe they're
not pushing enough maybe I'm pushing for them but it does seem to me if you're looking at I hate to say fraud and
corruption i don't want to say that it's rampant it's not at DOE but 140,000
you're going to find people so my question is are you thinking about increasing funding for this particular oversight agency uh I have not seen a
request coming to me from them they uh they had a request for OTPS funding
which we provided them but again I would just discuss with my staff to see if
they have received something i just think generally I'm not getting into CCB i'm not getting into Department of
Correction etc but we need more oversight i'm not saying is this administration is any administration
oversight keeps corruption and loss of funding down other question is about uh
clubouses you know this is an ongoing issue larger clubouses are funded but we need $4 million for the smaller
clubouses the city council had to pick it up before do you have any interest in this $4 million very smart keeps people
with mental illness off the street and mental illness issues are a focus of all
of us we need $4 million for clubouses we put that in the exec in this plan we
added $4 million to continue the existing uh
clubhouse services for the big ones how about for the smaller ones there's two different RFP went out for the larger
ones i'm talking about the smaller one so far no RFP um well again as I said uh we will uh
discuss this uh uh in uh as part of adoption because again uh that swap came
to us in term of request and uh you know I will discuss it with uh DOMH and see
if uh there is uh something specific that they were interested in they want
we're interested i don't know about them we're interested just so you know um school-based mental health clinics i
know the speaker to her credit talked about this uh we need another 3.75 million to cover what Medicaid does not
and I have to say as you do that the school-based mental health clinics are where the problems can be um dealt with
before they end up on the street or end up at Rikers or any other issue so what's the status with uh support for
school-based mental health clinics in the schools um again uh we could we will follow up
uh with you and your office uh on this and um because as I
said uh if we don't have the request coming from the agencies you know we uh but we'll follow up with you okay um
when Molly Park was here an excellent commissioner she said of course that there could be a savings of $11 million
you know when all of the FEPs are used and people are back in their housing the
trouble is uh cost of feeps could go from 30% to 40% of anyone's uh rent the
there are about 1,800 1,800 people who have will be affected in this five-year
cycle uh there's some fear that some of them will go back to the shelters because of
the increase in rental that they have to pay so my question is have you uh figured in your budget um when this
Reich rent hike goes into effect that people could be back in shelter wouldn't it make more sense to keep it at 30%
again our goal is uh we don't want people to go back to shelter but at the same time we're also at the same time
trying to make sure that the program is feasible okay in term of uh in the long
run so therefore we have to find ways to manage it it's a program that started at about $300 million 5 years ago and it's
about like $1.2 billion now mhm so it's a good allocation of funding it works i
understand we understand but at the same time you know we are also uh uh resource
uh constraint so therefore we have to find a way at the pace that it's growing is going so fast that it it could
threaten the viability of the program itself oh but so you haven't figured in anybody going back to shelter as part of
this funding i they just they have not yet implemented the program yet so
therefore we don't know okay i'm just letting you know that some of them will go back and you should figure out keep it at 30% would make sense i understand
your difference of opinion um finally food um I know that you heard a little bit from uh Council Member Ayella but
obviously the pantries the soup kitchens and so on are desperate what is your thinking about any any increased
allocation just generally for all the food concerns that we're all facing with our constituents yeah as I said we added
uh uh resources uh about uh um 36 uh I believe um $50 million where we have $36
million to the uh uh CFC uh program we also added $10 million for go to
groceries to go program but again as I said to uh the uh uh council member um
you know we will continue to have discussion with her and city council and during adoption and if resources are
available and the needs are there we'll have a discussion okay thank you very much okay questions from council member
Riley followed by Denowitz thank you chair uh good afternoon to the administration thank you so much for
being here today uh just a few questions in the executive plan DOA DOH MH was
allocated 47.3 million for mobile treatment teams in fiscal year 2026 we
first thought that this was funding that was going to be an expansion of the program but later realized that this is
rather to replace expiring funding from the American Rescue Plan these are
critical services that have proven to be effective and we have requested in our budget response with the administration
to add another 30 million to expand these teams why wasn't there an additional funded added to the executive
budget for the mobile treatment teams uh as you know funding as you know funding is very limited so what we first do to
begin with was to say hey the program is funded with stimulus dollars okay let's
try to make sure okay we could backfill it to begin with all right to make sure because otherwise if we don't find those
resources to make sure to to back fill the program you know basically the program would go away so that's the
first thing we have to do okay and then as we go forward and then we we will do an assessment of the program to see if
additional resources are needed the average wait time for the individual to enter the assertive community treatment
or the act is 93 days which is long wait for someone dealing with severe mental
services have you spoken with DOM MH about additional resources that would significantly decrease the weight times
we will have we'll engage them to see if uh there is a challenge on their part why the wait time is so long and if the
uh if uh uh the uh discussion is about uh uh resources not the process because
sometimes process are broken and you could give you you know more resources
it's not going to solve the problem so we'll have a discussion with them and see where you know why the wait time is
so long if it's a process will you report back to the council after you of course we will thank you there are
currently 16 schoolbased and this uh is a part of council member Brewer's question as well there are currently 16
schoolbased mental health uh clinics funded with 5 million uh through H&H DOE
and DOH this is one of the most impactful programs as council member Brewer just mentioned that needs to be
baselined at adoption and we have been advocating for at least 2 years about this why has this program not been
baseline and what is OMB's plan to finally baseline funding for mental health continuum uh starting fiscal year
2026 uh our goal is to be honest with you we always would always love to baseline
funding for programs is just a question of of course identifying the long-term funding and we have so many competing
needs you know and so we have to make decisions about hey when we find those dollars which program you're going to
baseline long you know provide long funding for them long term but again we continue to review those programs and as
resources become available if we have uh you know long-term res source of funding this is some program that is worth you
know exploring uh funding for it long term we will do so but again it's just a
question of identify first the long-term funding and but if it's not available
it's not available you know okay chair if I may thank you 988 is the city's
dedicated hotline for New Yorkers to call for all of their medical excuse me their mental hygiene needs including
mental health concerns and additional services we know that this year the program experienced a call and text
volume of 335,000 doh testify that they believe
this volume would increase if more New Yorkers were aware of this uh number 988
the program is funded at 21.8 million in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 which is a
decreased number of 10.9 million compared to fiscal year 2024 what are the factors that contribute to such a
decrease and do you plan to restore the 10.9 million in fiscal year 2026 adopted
budget i believe what happened is uh DHMH reached an agreement with the
vendor and you know and the agreement is cheaper okay so therefore that's the
reason but it won't cut the services it won't cut services all right and my last question is more of a a district
question um I represent Co-op City um and if you don't have this number now you could provide it for me later on
currently Co-op City operates their own public safety um and their own sanitation um but they're seeing uh
needs in the community do you have a number of how much um I guess funding uh
co-op city saving the city by operating their own public safety and sanitation process if you don't um can you please
uh update me as soon as possible uh so we could figure out how the city could address other concerns uh that co-op
city has such as public safety and quality of life issues my staff will reach out to you with an answer thank
you thank you chair okay questions from council member Denowitz
thank you chair good afternoon Mr director um very simple question would
you say it is better to have more students or more people in New York City enrolled in college or not more more we
want more right um a few years ago this council uh piloted a program called CUTUNI Reconnect which in the past three
years has resulted in more than about 47,000 more students attending CUNI um
you're you're a money guy you know this is good more people in New York City going to attending college getting
degrees earning more that's good for our tax base fewer people on public assistance for a program that's so
incredibly successful year after year why was zero funding allocated for CUNI
reconnect uh as you know this plan was very good for Kuni we It was what i'm sorry very
good very good for CUNI this budget and they're very happy with the plan that we
have um we gave we restored $91 million
uh for uh CUNI uh $96 million and we baseline
uh those uh funds we gave them $9.1 million for Yeah i just want to pause
there are good things in the budget to be certain but to be clear those were cuts that you all made so you're
restoring your own cut so I just want to be honest about the conversation we're having i'm simply want to ask about
Reconnect and for a program for a program that brings more students in 47,000 over three years more students
getting degrees getting the supports they need to succeed and go back into our communities and contribute more
that's exactly what we want people to do in this city uh 11.8 million would go a
long way will that be included in the adopted plan we will have discussion with the city council this is a program
that is very close to the heart of the speaker that is a program that she you know basically advocated for so we will
work with the council as we get closer to adoption to see what can be done
getting no commitments there but uh I I'll repeat this is as you know again an incredibly successful program that the
speaker spearheaded uh and this is an investment this is a good investment that is good policy and it's good
finances um one of the things that the um I would say the mayor does very well
and I think is very powerful for a lot of kids in this city is he speaks openly about having a disability um and I think
that is very important to see people in leadership positions saying that out
loud it is also important to include policy and budget items that support that value uh the council requested $2.1
million for disability services for CUTUNI students to ensure that more that
that they have the resources they need so that our students have the accommodations and support they need this was also omitted from the executive
budget um and today can we commit to including this on the mayor's side the $2.1 million in the adopted plan we'll
have discussion with you and the city council as we move toward the budget adoption i said but this is more than a
this this is the discussion this is the public discussion and this is critical and you have this is the beginning of
the discussion this isn't the beginning the the this is not the beginning that's
a little silly to say um the the you know we're talking about investments just a few million dollars that will get
more students enrolled in CUNI more students to stay enrolled in CUNI more students to
graduate more students and then graduates to to provide more for our tax
base and also including more of those students who are historically underrepresented and historically left
behind including people with disabilities and I would think as a as a mayor who understands this probably more
intimately than most anyone uh in this room any one of us up here he should be the first one saying we need to invest
this small amount of money $2.1 million to ensure people like him have a better
chance of success at CUNI as I said to you we we will work with you and the
council because as I said you know we have limited resources we added uh a lot
of resources to Kun's budget in the exact budget that were taken away by you in years past yes we love this question
let's I I think it's important to be honest about that and important to recognize that these aren't expenditures
these are investments and I would just add as it relates to CUNI reconnect that
at a time when we have a federal government that is doing everything they can to reduce the enrollment of
international students and immigrant students at CUNI we should be doing everything we can in this city to be
recruiting people to ensure that they have a shot at a college education and that is our job here in the city and we
should be doing everything we can to push back against these policies of the federal government that are harming our
students here that are harming our city and harming our public colleges thank you chair
okay uh Deputy Speaker
sorry I had a couple of follow-up questions on the first question is on
immigration the executive uh plan does not include any dedicated funding for legal services for unaccompanied minors
despite the growing need and the loss of critical federal support on March 21st the federal government abruptly
terminated the unaccompanied uh children's program contract cutting nearly 14 million for New York City
legal providers this decision left more than 1300 children without an attorney and some already have court hearings
scheduled has uh Moya or HA requested additional funding for unaccompanied children for fiscal year 26
uh as far as I'm concerned I'm not aware of that but I know for sure we added uh
resources um for uh Moya in the budget for legal services but for spec
specifically for those uh children I'm not aware of any requests coming to us
for those specific children okay could you could you I will double check that back to me thank you i mean it's it's
pretty scary because we we have children now you know just yesterday we had a a high schooler that was detained um and
you know this is the beginning of what we anticipate will be a long form we remain committed to supporting
immigration legal services as I said we added $42 million in the budget for for the for fiscally 26 but for the specific
children I'm not aware but I will follow up with you okay so given that the new the New York City continues to serve as
a key destination for immigrant youth many of whom arrive fleeing violence poverty and instability what steps is
the city taking to coordinate with nonprofit legal service providers to ensure continuity of care for these children and also making sure that these
children do not appear in court alone again as I said I will follow up with uh
uh uh with uh Moya to uh see what they're doing and we'll report back to
you okay do you commit to supporting um to support the funding request of 6.3
million needed in fiscal year 26 for legal service support for unaccompanied minors uh again as I said I cannot make
a commitment at this point in time but we'll uh review the needs and as we progress toward adoption and then we'll
have a discussion okay um at the preliminary budget hearing Commissioner Schaefer testified that nearly 100,000
applications for asylum work authorization and temporary protected status have been filed since the opening
of the asylum application help center assuming that um OASO is coordinating
all this work for asylum seekers with CBOS why is there no funding allocated
for OSO in the executive budget beyond the 3.2 million added in fiscal year uh
25's preliminary budget and what is the future of the the office's staffing if
the office is closed uh closing starting fiscal year 26 uh again we are still assessing the
future of funding level for OASO uh as we move toward uh one system with
the DHS system so you know um we don't expect to have uh any uh impact on
services uh as we move toward fully integrated DHS uh system going forward but again we
uh we're still assessing you know the future funding level needed for so as we
transition from uh the current system that we have with the herks toward a
fully integrated DHS system so you don't anticipate any disruption to services no
do you anticipate any cuts to staffing and that that that currently staff that office we I'm not anticipating that but
uh you know but again it's the level of service we don't anticipate that level of service to be impacted because you
know uh DHS will take over uh whatever they're doing and we we will see you
know where we're going to end at the end of the day with uh uh but uh as you know
city doesn't you know cut uh just uh you
know lay off folks for the sake of lay off people we sometimes we assign folks
we do different things but again at this moment in time we assessing you know where they're going to be because again
as I said uh we anticipated a significant uh uh decline in the census
but lately there has been a slowdown okay in the number of people leaving the
system so again we'll see where we where we land uh in in the future but right
now we are not uh um expecting to see um
staff uh layoff okay or any such thing all right um during the uh health and
hospitals executive budget hearing last week we discussed the urgent need to expand emergency rooms at Metropolitan
and Elmherst Hospitals with Dr katz and his team the Metropolitan ER expansion will cost well it you it was estimated
at 65 I believe now it's 111 million um and the cost of the Elmherst ER
expansion has not been determined yet does OM believe these capital projects are feasible in the short term and what
are the potential challenges with these capital projects and what are the roadblocks to allocating the necessary
funding uh we would need an assessment from H&H uh uh so that we could have a
better sense of uh what the needs are and what can be done i mean we I'll just tell you
personally Metropolitan happens to be in my district and we've been working with that hospital and been able to um
allocate a significant amount of resources to upgrading some of the equipment and and the spaces that are used by patients but the hospital hasn't
really been renovated since it was uh constructed the emergency room is um has
capacity for 25 patients and they um often have you know double that amount
and so people are like scattered everywhere the conditions are just not um ideal for providing um basic uh uh
you know medical services the rooms are still rooms that are closed in um where
the staffing um nurses and doctors are not even able to see the patients from
where they are so I I've never been to Elmherst i can't speak to that but I I would assume that they have similar
issues and um we have been trying to get this hospital like on the list of
priorities for you know quite a number of years and and so this year you know obviously have been pushing a little bit
more aggressively um just because it's really um it's in really bad condition
like if you see it you you probably be a little bit offended by we will have a discussion with H&H okay and then I
guess my final plug because this is my final um budget um we did have uh you
know I want to thank you know uh former mayor Delasio was very gracious and and
helping us uh get the the acquired funding for the esplanade renovation um however through the resoning of East
Harlem we were able to get the north side of the esplanade done and then um a
few years ago we were allocated the funding for the south side but there were 10 blocks in the middle that are still falling into the river that are
currently blocked off to uh pedestrian traffic that were not funded for some reason um so I'm just putting it out in
the universe because I don't I think if we're going to invest so much money in making it beautiful it doesn't make any
sense to leave those 10 blocks that are like squarely in the middle um out of the planning process okay I will I will
talk with the uh is it EDC to find out what's going on thank you okay
okay i just have a couple of cleanup questions from some of my colleagues uh quickly about Mox the service desk so
the executive plan includes uh 1 and a.5 million in baseline funding starting in
FY26 excuse me to hire 20 staff for the Mox service desk can you confirm that
Mox has approval to hire for all their vacant positions uh yes
okay because we heard during the April 30th hearing on late payments to human
service providers um the we were told at the hearing OMB allowed agencies to hire
for 183 positions that were involved with processing human service providers but we were trying to understand why
those positions were subject to the hiring freeze in the first place um we um we have exempted
uh uh those contract staff from the 241 have they always been exempted or just
recently uh we I think it's recently i'm not sure recently say it recently okay
does OM keep track of of vacancy rates by positions at at the agency level
we keep track of vacancies for each agency and uh you know to know exactly
uh what how many vacancies they have and uh you know and if there is a need for
us to exempt some titles some positions that uh we believe is critical we do so
so what's the estimated savings in the budget from the existing hiring freeze
uh I could give you I don't have that number in front of me but I would give it to you i'll send you that uh that
estimate and do you have the the total value of the PS acrruels in the current year i would also provide you that
information as well okay and also add to the list how much
would the city underspend its budget if there was a 5% average vacancy rate in FY26
okay i would provide you okay um DSNY the the bid
containerization requirement has OM conducted or reviewed a a cost analysis
of the containerization compliance and the burden that it would place on bids and nonprofit sanitation partners
i believe um the um the um commissioner has been working
with the bid uh to uh but they told us they they paused it to the end of the year but
they didn't say what would happen from there yeah uh you know I know they've been working together uh in terms of uh
uh to see what they can do uh to provide the most suitable and the most cost
effective uh way of uh uh getting this done but
again we will work with the council uh as part of the adapted budget to determine if uh there's anything that
can be done the council's concerned about any potential downstream fiscal impact on the sanitation budget and
operations if bids and nonprofits can no longer provide supplemental sanitation
services i'm not sure that the administration is considering that yeah we we're looking into that as well
and lastly on the NYC bin reimbursement requirement so back in February we
passed uh intro 1126A requires DSNY to provide official
NYC waste bins at no cost or reimburse eligible small property owners one to two family homes who have already
purchased the bins um has OMB received any updated cost projections from DSNY
for implementing uh this bill um we
um the bins that we have currently are the cheapest to be honest with you it's like
$50 and um you know and uh so again we
estimate it's uh you know probably $36 million
uh to provide uh uh the bins but um again from my perspective is
um we have some of the best quality B right now and you know at around
$50 it's uh from my perspective is a reasonable responsibility of city property owners to buy those things at
uh at the price that was basically negotiated by GSNY which is a very good
price so is OM going to allocate funding to support the mandate um again we will
work with the council you know to see if uh you know what can be done but uh you
know what what uh what would be the optimum level of funding that's needed as part of uh back and forth with uh the
council but again you know we we we uh we intend to work with you and if
resources are available we will come back to you and make your recommendation
okay director that is everything I've got thank you very much it's been great working with you and look forward to uh
landing the plane next month great working with you as well sir thank you all right we'll take a break about I
don't know 10 15 minutes and then Oh sorry 1:30 we're going to start 1:30 we'll be back and we'll hear

thank you uh Chair Brandon and Council Member Brewer thank you very much for the opportunity to testify and the
slight flexibility i'm coming from the City College commencement which is just about the most hopeful thing you could
be at in the world uh wow the future looks bright in those young people
graduating from City College today overwhelmingly first generation and immigrants are children of immigrants um
but still I'm very excited to be here and joined by Executive Deputy Controller Franchesco Bundeszy and Deputy Controller for Budget Crystal
Olsen who prepared our office's full analysis of the fiscal year 2026 budget
and accompanying financial plan when I came before you in March I noted that
our city's need for strong fiscal management had never been more urgent the threats posed by the Trump
administration to New York City to our people our economy our finances have unfortunately only intensified since
then with the dizzying back and forth and actual implementation and court rulings of the tariffs the Trump
administration has introduced chaos into the global economy and created extraordinary levels of uncertainty it
has meanwhile attempted to terminate pause or rescend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants recently
already awarded to the city through its flurry of executive orders and policy
changes and this is even before considering the potential devastation that the congressional budget
reconciliation bill could have on federal aid to the city government to the state and directly to New Yorkers it
was in this environment already back in March that the Adams administration bllidly released what it called the best
budget ever almost like mocking all of us with little recognition of the grave
reality the city faces from the economy and actions in Washington the executive budget and the May financial plan while
reflecting record high revenues adds nothing to the city's budget reserves or to its rainy day fund when adjusted for
prepayments spending budgeted for FY25 is $1.4 billion more than projected
revenues continuing a pattern of running a deficit for the third year in a row
the May plan also reflects larger outyear budget gaps than those projected by the mayor in January with no real
savings or efficiency program to address them and this is before accounting for the mayor's practice of underbudgeting
uh which we believe totals a whopping 4.05 05 billion in FY26 and 3.6 billion
on average in the out years uh when including the costs we know we're going to spend on rental assistance overtime
shelter Carter cases MTA subsidies and more some of those could be reduced with
good management others of them we're going to pay almost for certain none of them are reflected in this budget at a
time when the mayor should be preparing New York City for a potentially more constrained fiscal reality the May plan
in many ways remains just the opposite my office remains focused on protecting
New Yorkers and preparing for the challenges that may come given the great economic uncertainty and the risks with
the changes at the federal level present my office has gone ahead and prepared two economic and revenue forecasts one
that assumes we do not enter a recession and another that accounts for a mild recession in the no recession scenario
uh we project city revenues will exceed OM's estimates by 292 million this year
and 108 million next year in FY26 growing to 2.95 billion in 29 applying
the formula my office previously proposed to establish annual minimum deposits into the revenue stabilization
fund our rainy day fund this scenario would mean that would mean depositing 1.46 billion into the rainy day fund
this fiscal year in the case of a mild recession where higher tariffs persist
into 26 we rest estimate tax revenues would fall by 225 million in FY25 2.3
billion next year 2.12 billion in 27 uh before rebounding in 29 we would still
propose the formula would still you know support making a rainy day fund deposit
of $1.3 billion this year bringing the fund balance to 3.3 billion which could
then be used in FY26 and 27 if a recession transpires based on the
guidelines we've proposed i'm also again calling on the city to add $1 billion to
the general reserve in the FY26 budget as a protecting New York City reserve as
we brace for potentially devastating cuts not only to direct federal funding
but also to fally funded programs that keep millions of New Yorkers housed and fed these funds would be set aside and
could be deployed to mitigate the worst like the worst of the likely impacts um
already the federal government has announced cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars house Republicans have approved nearly $15 billion in New York
state cuts and cost shifts in health care and SNAP benefits alone uh together
if implemented all of that could easily translate to a $10 billion reduction in service for New York City residents not
only in but including and beyond the city budget um I'll give one other example of just a cut that's not in my
written testimony but that that reserve should be used for we already know they're eliminating 7,700 housing choice
vouchers um that's 7,700 families in New York City who will very likely be
homeless if we don't take action and yet to my knowledge the administration hasn't reached out to those families to
say "What's your circumstance what will you need to avoid being homeless?" or thought about whether city feeps uh
would be appropriate for some of them because if they wind up homeless then we are going to spend more on them than we
would if we did thoughtful planning those are the kinds of things that that extra billion dollars in the general
reserve would put us in a better position for in either economic scenario
my office estimates that budget gaps will be larger than those presented by OM in the no recession scenario we
project ending FY25 with a gap of 1.7 billion growing to 5.7 billion in 26 and
8.8 billion in FY29 um that's largely from higher spending estimates including the
deposits into the rainy day fund and general reserve in the recession scenario the FY25 gap would increase
modestly by 112 million to 1.87 billion uh if we then had rainy day fund
withdrawals of 1.6 billion in the subsequent 2 years the gaps would be 6.4
billion and 9.3 billion in 26 and 27 um
and now uh you know for the other part of my testimony I just want to turn to one issue uh that perhaps exemplifies
the mayor's disregard for this political moment and what it means for New York more than any other and that is
immigration the detention of Dylan a New York City public school student attending Ellis Prep in the Bronx
underscores what's at stake this is a young person who did everything right he followed all the rules showed up to
court as required and was still arrested by ICE agents outside the courthouse and
is now cycling through detention in other states and who knows where that's our New York City public school student
his case is a chilling reminder that even New Yorkers who play by the rules are vulnerable and need legal
representation it's why we must invest more in immigration legal services and
more creatively so no unaccompanied minor has to show up to immigration court alone that was the idea behind
knife up that's the idea behind right to counsel in housing court what this council has long wanted to do it is
critical to step it up now and so it's unconscionable that the mayor's budget does so little to protect immigrant New
Yorkers or shore up the dedicated legal service organizations working under increasingly challenging circumstances
to support them while the mayor has consistently failed to rightsize the resources for immigrant legal services
escalating anti-immigrant actions taken by the Trump administration and in too many cases aided by Mayor Adams make
these omissions in the executive budget all the more shameful but it's also a time for creativity people weren't going
to go to the asylum seeker application help center and they're hesitant to go to city or government offices so the
city the city should begin to fill the holes in immigrant legal services in this budget by including at least 7
million for IARE so immigrant kids like Dylan have access to attorneys that will ensure their cases have a fighting
chance um thanks to Musk and Doge who abruptly terminated federal contacts
funding legal representation for unaccompanied minors in removal proceedings more and more children are
facing deportation alone we should make sure that no kid in New York City has to
go to an ICE hearing or an immigration court hearing without a lawyer new York
City can afford to do that that will require partnership because it's the schools that know who and where they are
but has to make referrals to organizations that can provide it funding should also be allocated to
Restore Action NYC therefore in schools hospitals libraries uh community- based
organizations even in people's homes when they need it and to support Moya's immigrant rights workshops while I
commend the council for providing funding to keep the rapid response legal collaborative going full mayoral funding
should be restored to match the growing demand um we should also increase funding for the CCHR and DCWP to protect
working New Yorkers bolster resources for street vendors and include funding to support processing of permits and
increased outreach and education further I urge the speaker and the council to
increase the trans equity fund to $10 million using council discretionary funds and to work with the mayor to
increase funding for LGBTQ youth and young adult housing and ensure that New Yorkers can still access gender
affirming care despite potential changes in federal policy um uh let's see fi uh the city budget
must reflect our shared values and should not be used as a tool to further one executive's apparent desire to
collude with Trump but rather should be used to invest in our families and children and protect the most vulnerable
New Yorkers um but for one issue that I really have to underline unfortunately resources for DOE and 3K in particular
continue to be among the casualties of the mayor's perennial budget gains um although the May plan includes some
additional funding for 3K and preK we estimate that more than $150 million more is needed annually in FY26 to
sustain those programs at current levels um and meanwhile in a way that I think was a surprise to everyone uh the
executive budget uh doesn't reckon with the reality uh that's the state budget has left us around child care vouchers
um it's wonderful that we have tens of thousands of families now able to access access affordable care um uh while the
state encouraged the city to increase enrollment uh it did not make clear and it is now requiring that the city is
being hit with half the bill poor planning and communication on part of both the administration and the state
have led to families facing uncertainty the state appropriated an additional 350
million for the program but for state fiscal year 2026 only and at the same
time mandatorily increased the city's minimum contribution resulting in funding needs of at least $275 million
for the program in FY26 not reflected in the executive budget and growing to 625
million in future years unless additional funding is provided uh so I
urge uh the mayor and the speaker to go back to the state uh I know they've closed their budget but they closed
their budget in a way that opened challenges for us and we either need to find them in the city budget or get the
state to help because the answer cannot be to tell thousand thousands perhaps tens of thousands of families that they
won't be able to keep having their child care new York families need and deserve city leadership that's working toward a
vision of truly accessible universal child care not pointing fingers over the
shortcomings of the existing system um although the mayor has failed to articulate a plan to overcome the
funding gap this bud budget can and must take necessary steps to ensure that no
families currently receiving subsidies lose them the executive budget prepared
by the Adams administration for FY26 as I've outlined uh lacks even the most
basic elements to guard against the risks we now face uh we urge the council
as you engage in your negotiations with them in the coming month to set aside the critical reserves necessary to
protect the essential services that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable in our city you have fought that battle
many times in the past and I know you will work hard to do it over the next month thank you
thank you controller um I want to dive right into uh the report that your office published
back in April uh taking Trump's tariff seriously um you explored three
scenarios of federal policy changes i just want to dive into a little bit um out of the three scenarios which do you
believe is the most likely for the country and which you believe is the most likely for the city um I'll say a
couple of words and then turn it over to uh Franchesco and Christa who worked on this report and obviously I mean it's
you know like we live in such an era of uncertainty even yesterday with the court rulings the tariffs are on the
tariffs are off how do you decide which is the most likely to come in here and present so what we chose to do in this
report and today is present you two scenarios mild recession and no recession um in the report we issued we
thought mild recession was most likely because the tariffs that seem likely to remain regardless uh will really have
economic impacts um uh but it just feels like a roll of the dice and that's why
we really urge putting the resources in reserves we don't know what the courts are going to rule we don't know what Trump is going to do in relationship to
China it might be a tariff scenario that causes a recession and perhaps the
tariffs won't happen he'll claim it was some kind of win and roll them back and the economy will be better we'll still
be glad we have the reserves in that scenario and I'll turn it over which taxes do you think would be most acutely
affected under either scenario i mean um I guess
I couldn't have said it better than the controller about you know um what's going to happen i think we've taken out
the the deeper recession scenario from this report um we consider that risk
lower than than than a recession it's hard to pick between you know the the
two uh you know slow growth versus mild recession at this point but uh the first
taxes that will be affected are the nonprop everything but the property tax we know that the property tax is you
know it's got internal stabilizers and and averaging so that's not the one that uh reflects current economic conditions
but all of the others PIT sales uh hotel uh business taxes would would be
affected okay i asked uh OMB the same question they didn't really have a great
answer um Standard and Poor's most recent reading of the city's general obligation bonds notes that the city has
large financial reserves of almost 11.4 billion at the end of SY24
s SNP looks at both the city reserve accounts and the surplus budget role at the end of the fiscal year uh while S&P
notes that this level is large reserves nonetheless have been declining since they peaked in FY22 uh they were at 12.7
billion at the end of FY22 12.3 billion at the end of FY23 and 11.4 billion at
the end of FY24 i think OM said they think it'd be around that same amount
this year do you agree with that or do you think I guess the question is what level of financial reserves does it look
like we'll be reaching by the end of FY25
okay there is still a little bit of disagreement regarding you know what the tax revenues are going to be for this
year so you know the ball is still rolling but based on the executive budget um the the city is uh putting in the
budget stabilization account which I I understand that standard imports count as a reserve uh one and a half billion
more or less less than it did in FY24 right uh so by that account and without
changing the other reserves the the FY25 reserves at the end of the year as
calculated by S&P should be lower by about 1 and a.5 billion
we do feel strongly though just as like a matter of budgeting you can't count something as a reserve that you are also
counting for spending next year so I mean what you're rolling into next year's budget it it isn't a reserve
because you call it one that is a role and um besides being a way to protect
city services during a downturn uh reserves may be able to help us lower the effective cost of our capital
projects and their ratings of the city's general obligation bonds moody's noted that stronger reserves including
deposits to the revenue stabilization fund would lead to a ratings increase so how much additional deposits into the
reserves do you think would be necessary to affectuate a ratings increase
you're acting as though they're you know like us as opposed to like the oracle at
Deli right um I don't think that even Moody's would be
able to tell you right i I think it's important and that's not just Moody's but Croll and other uh and all of the
rating agencies really they're saying if you have a rule if you have a policy that you know sort of tells you when
you're going to deposit and you know under what conditions you're going to withdraw and and you know and that's a
policy that is being implemented that's a credit positive right um you know as a general matter uh the
US credit is AA1 the TFA credit is A1 the geo credit is AA2 I And you know
it's um I would say that uh better reserve
policy would help i don't know to what extent the rating agencies would you know go from there to increasing the the
rating but increasing the city's bond rating would save the city in lower debt service costs right it would other other
things equal uh you know what we pay is depends on uh you know how our credit is seen and how much we issue right the you
know we've issuing we've been issuing a lot of debt right the more you the more you issue you know the the more
compensation investors are going to ask for okay I want to ask about the Manhattan class A office vacancy rate of
the many notable lagging impacts of the pandemic one area that continues to show little or no improvement is the demand
for office space uh Kushman and Wakefield reported uh 22.7% of all
Manhattan class A office space still remains vacant as of the end of FY Y25
uh Q3 we asked OM about the uh we asked OM earlier about the number of
applications that the city has received so far specifically for the office to residential conversion so are you able
to speak uh to any of the details regarding the progress on these conversions
yes so we don't have access to the accelerators data um we have done some
research we have um estimated a pipeline of about uh 44 buildings that would
conver convert to residential this is a mixture of rental and condos um that is
probably uh we estimate 15 million square ft of uh of office space of which
about 12 million could access the tax incentives in the short term um so
that's about we estimate you know if you take a look at the decline in occupancy for class B and C the ones that and and
the ones that are not Hudson Yards and the like if you look at the decline in occupancy this could um absorb about a
third of the loss so it's that Do you want to direct them to this chart in the where is this in the report this is a
secret chart oh sorry top secret chart that that will be published i see we
will be sharing this information shortly but it's not yet in your book i always have a report for that what What impacts
do you think um the the commercial to residential conversions would have on
the city's tax role um most so most of the these conversions
are going to be converted to rentals and we believe most of them are going to take advantage of the 467mm
uh tax exemptions most of the space is in Manhattan um so what what happens now
is that this buildings are being taxed as office and they're paying something and then that amount of tax is going to
drop to whatever is the 10% of the valuation that DOF um is going to put on
this building so um you know preliminarily in the secret report that soon will be uh published uh we we put
the price of this 12 million square ft in present value at about $5 billion uh
in terms of you know the the tax expenditures that that are associated with these buildings so it's more a
measure of it's more a program that stabilizes the market and puts it on an
a more even kill than generating tax revenues though you know we're going to
lose tax revenues in part because we are buying affordability and and in in substantial amounts I would say um
and in Manhattan where other programs are not able to produce um housing or
affordable housing so in a crypto event that the mayor attended in Las Vegas earlier this
week he announced to our surprise New York City would issue bit bonds has the
Did the administration give you a heads up before they announced this great idea we we were we read about it in the paper
as well and were as surprised as you perhaps more surprised since we partner with them on the issuance of bonds and
uh yes there there we will not be uh partnering in the issuing of any
bitcoinbacked bonds um in on my watch as controller and and is that because the
asset class is just renowned for chaos and fluctuation yes and it is renowned
for chaos and fluctuation and it probably does not comply with the city's
bond issuance criteria what you know there are folks around the country who do use bonds for expenses but New York
City famously does not do that got in a lot of trouble during the fiscal crisis doing it so we only use our bonds for
capital assets uh and directive 10 does not identify Bitcoin as a capital asset
and that's actually I mean a Bitcoinbacked bond has as I understand it and I'm not an expert in this but 10%
of it is used to purchase Bitcoin to purchase cryptocurrency which just on
its face would not be compliant with directive 10 and the city's rules for bond issuance so besides being a a wacky
idea so what what was our mayor thinking that's dangerous to speculate
on i mean I we asked OM and they had it wasn't like he let them know he was
going to bring this up no you know I mean yes I I think it was you know look and I this is serious you
know like we it's it's I guess it was reported that taxpayers paid for the trip to Vegas i think it's probably
worth looking at like all those expenses which ones were paid by taxpayers and which ones if any were paid by the
Bitcoin organizers of the conference either way it's highly problematic should not be taxpayer dollars spending
for him to go to Vegas but it also should not be that like Bitcoin bros are
paying for the mayor to go on a a marketing trip um so whether he had
some obligations as a result of who paid for the trip or whether he genuinely
believes it would be a good idea it is really quite unacceptable either way
okay thank you controller uh we've been joined by council members Sanchez Williams and Hudson and we've got
questions from Council Member Brewer thank you very much um as chair of oversight and investigations I'm always
trying to make sure there's enough money for oversight agencies and we asked about uh DOI and we uh asked about the
IG at the uh Department of Education which apparently is so underfunded but
never asked for funding you got CCRB you have um I'm sure that uh Council Member
Williams will talk about um uh human rights etc there's a lot of them so my question to you is do you is that
something that you look at in terms of their funding i always think that there's just not enough investigators or
attorneys in these oversight agencies well one thing I'll point to is we do
now have a really good uh tracker on our website of headcount so one thing you
can very easily see on a real time basis is what budgeted headcount agency was in
the past what it is currently and what actual headcount in those agencies is so
it's a really easy way to look at the city the commission on human rights or uh any of the others and see how much
down are they from where they used to be and also how many people do they really have because in many cases there's big
gaps even between budget headcount and actual um we've looked I'm trying to think we've looked at a few of the
agencies i don't know that we've done an oversight recently um I'll give you one example though as
an oversight agency ourselves of a place where we could use uh some resources you
know one thing that we do is settle claims against the city um and it turns
out the software we're using for that is like in cobalt it's 30 years old we
could be identifying patterns much better of harm being caused that we could actually reduce claims if we're
able to modernize so we have an RFP out right now uh for new software system for
claims adjustments we have to wait for that to come back but you know that's one more area that I think the city
could do we could be doing much more effective oversight it's about $2 billion we spent last year on claims
against the city in an area where there's just a a lot less scrutiny than we should have well that would be a
place where DOI could make a difference if it had the uh adequate staffing
agreed next is I always ask um IBO but this unpaid uh dollars the ones that
don't get collected um a few years ago when I asked IBO was 2.1 billion is that
something that you look at i always get told "Oh it can never be collected." But it's very frustrating for those of us
who do pay our taxes to see uh those that don't is that something that you look at is that something that we should
be looking at um well the 2.1 billion um has several
components right uh it's got the ECB uh u return to oath um summones um and
adjudication uh has got uh property tax um delinquencies and it had unpaid you
know uh uh speed tickets and and red light tickets right uh in part that number was affected by what happened
during the pandemic and the enforcement during the pandemic so some of those you know red light tickets of you know that
were outstanding have coming down there is a lean sales schedule for June 3rd um
at this point so part of that you know is is being addressed I mean we did an audit about the uh the red light cameras
right and and the speed cameras you know that those are still outstanding issues um the ECB debt is many of those um
entities are not in existence anymore and there is no nothing that we can go that the city can go after that and you
know the the department of finance often does well sometime at times does amnesties right and and people come
forth but it's not like they generate a huge amount of money right they generate 40 60 million right uh so that's in part
that's a reflection of the fact that you know a lot of that money is notional and it's in the books rather than being real
okay i'm going to actually say one thing that sort of builds from that that's um since this is my you know will be my uh
my last year as controller for future council oversight work and and others
potential uh future work in the controllers's office or elsewhere um no one has probably done more than
Franchesco to pay attention to the quality of our estimates for what the
city is owed and what the city owes at the end of a year and some of that is
you know things like speeding tickets but some of that is you know we've still got outstanding contracts and obviously
if we're 10 months or a year late in paying often we don't really know you know what they're going to actually
invoice us for um the same is there's similar challenges collecting on federal
contracts my goodness this year when we end the fiscal year how we estimate what
the federal government owes us and is likely to pay us is uh is going to present challenges so um I'm proud of
the work that my team has done in the Bureau of Accountancy under uh Franchesco's leadership but that is an
area that needs real attention from the next New York City controller and from
oversight sounds like oversight and investigations the city council as well
yes thank you um the other quick question is just in terms of um vacancies um I know that we're ongoing i
think what you're should say is we should just look at your data in terms of where all the how we can address the
vacancy issues it's two for one it's can't hire it's it's a whole lot of different things is there any one aspect
of that that you would think we should be focused on in terms of the number of vacancies it's going down but it still
exists yeah um so we did you know create that dashboard so you could see it and
then we periodically try to take a look at where we think an MMR indic there's a
mismatch between an MMR indicator and headcount and it doesn't look to me like
there is a process by which OM does that you can say by forcing us to slow roll
hiring here you're costing us more money because those those housing units are
vacant and the families are still in homeless shelters um but that does not seem to be um available and also you
looked at overtime do you have any recommendations on that for next year um
I mean uh you know on NYPD in particular you know we're about 1500 officers below
budgeted headcount 35,000 headcount 335 that number is going down because in 2005 there was a very big NYPD
recruitment class those folks are hitting their 20 and so I suspect that by the end of this year that number
could be two and even 3,000 officers and obviously the more you are below budgeted headcount the more you wind up
spending on overtime the commissioner has changed the academic credentials needed and that thinks she thinks
that'll help apparently it really jumped up the applications good or bad I don't know but it's helps with recruitment i
don't know if it helps with intelligence one thing that I've uh was suggested to me by the prior chief of department Ken
Corey was to look at expanding the NYPD cadet program that program is great but
it you have to right now already have 45 credits so if you're a person who's got
45 college credits you can apply for the NYPD cadet program become a cadet
they'll start paying you know a good share of your tuition while you work your way towards your BA he's
recommended opening it up to kids out of high school so you don't have to have any college credits that you could
enroll in the cadet program become a cadet they could pay we could the city could pay your tuition till you get your
associates and then you take the test and come on to the force in a more streamlined way and that I think would
address I mean obviously for a while they would be cadets and not officers but would really help with recruitment
but it has been shown over and over again that officers who do get some college education you know college
degree like anybody else just you know mature and benefit from it thank you
um I wanted to ask in your testimony you mentioned that the city needs to add 150 million for 3K and in the FY26 budget
can you elaborate on that yes we were comparing uh what the city
spent last year for 3K and preK um compared to what they currently have
budgeted for this year and next year um and then the so the shortfalls are as
mentioned um so we are assuming that the city needs at least what they spent last year they did add significant funding
but that was primarily to address um e like the special education prek seats
that they had funded for one year only they put in money to baseline those funds um and some other initiatives like
that um but they haven't addressed kind of this general underbudgeting issue um
that's coming okay
thank you all very much appreciate your testimony thank you thank
you okay we'll take a break 2:30 at 2:30 we will hear from the
Department of Finance thank you
[Music] okay good afternoon everyone welcome to
the third portion of today's uh the 13th and final day of executive budget hearings i'm Council Member Brandon i
chair the Committee on Finance welcome to Commissioner Preston Ninlack and your team thank you all for joining us today
to answer our questions uh my questions will largely focus on new needs uh lean
sale reform and business tax warrants uh just as a reminder only written testimony will be admitted for today's
hearing we're not doing any public testimony today if you wish to submit written testimony for the record you can
email it to testimony@counsel.nyc.gov anytime up to
72 hours after the conclusion of today's hearing i'm now going to turn it over to
my committee council Brian Saro to swear everyone in and we can get started uh
just noting we've been joined by council members Williams Brewer Sanchez and
Hudson good afternoon do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this
committee and to respond honestly to council member questions commissioner
Neblack yes first Deputy Sheer I do and
Deputy Commissioner James i do you may begin
okay thank you good afternoon Chair Brandon members of the committee and members of the council my name is
Preston Nibl and I'm the commissioner of the New York City Department of Finance i'm joined by First Deputy Commissioner
Jeffrey Shear and Jacqueline James our chief financial officer and deputy commissioner for administration and
planning thank you for the opportunity to testify today on our fiscal year 2026
executive budget now more than ever before the Department of Finance remains steadfast in our commitment to
administer the city's tax laws and to perform our other responsibilities fairly effectively and with our
customers New Yorkers squarely in mind at all times before discussing the AY's
executive budget for the coming year I would like to touch on a few updates including our progress on the tax lean sale the recent banking commission
meetings and the release of the city's final property assessment role
as you know we extended the deadline for owners to act to remove their properties from the lean sale by two weeks from May
19th to June 2nd to ensure that our outreach especially for class one homeowners would be
comprehensive this year's tax lean sale is the first in four years which meant that there was a larger atrisisk pool
than is typical but as part of the reforms we enacted last year together the city has engaged in the most
extensive outreach we have ever undertaken in connection with the lean sale with the help of our partners at
the Department of Environmental Protection the Mayor's Public Engagement Unit Housing Preservation and
Development and the Center for New York City Neighborhoods and their community partners we've knocked on over 6,500
doors made over 70,000 calls sent 100,000 postcards and held 57 in-person
outreach events in conjunction with 37 elected officials mostly council members
we extend our appreciation to all of you who assisted in hosting these events this Monday will be the last day for
owners to act so we urge any property owner who has not yet responded to a lean sale notice to please visit our
website nyc.gov/leansale or visit us in person at one of our five burough business
centers we appreciate the council's partnership and are here to assist your constituents
turning to the banking commission every May the banking commission meets to authorize the banking institutions that
the city of New York will use to safeguard the city's deposits and provide banking services for city
agencies although this process doesn't necessarily garner a lot of attention the security of the city's money is our
highest priority so we undertake a painstakingly thorough process to ensure the selection of banks capable of this
responsibility this year I'm pleased to report that 32 banking institutions were designated
including two new community banks Pon Bank which was formerly a community development financial institution and
Rididgewood Savings finally another annual event in the month of May is the release of the
final property assessment role which was published just this last Tuesday the role showed a solid year for real estate
in New York City with the overall market value of properties increasing by 5.39% and taxable billable assessed
value up 3.03% as usual the final assessment role was slightly lower than the tenative
role released in January down by 0.28% due to administrative reviews by DOF and
tax commission decisions owners can expect to receive their first quarter property tax bill
based on the final role in the second week of June so now let me turn to the executive
budget the DOF executive budget for fiscal year 2026 is 365.2 million our budget for the coming
year includes important strategic investments that will allow the agency to take meaningful steps forward in
accomplishing our important mission excuse me there are two pivotal
investments I'd like to specifically highlight first is an acrosstheboard adjustment in the pay scale for our city
tax auditors this measure is designed to both make us more competitive in the hiring of new entry- level auditors as
well as to improve our retention of more experienced senior auditors our tax auditors deserve a career path where
they can grow learn acquire experience and take on more complex cases and
supervisory responsibilities and be appropriately rewarded for their work all within the Department of Finance
this initiative is a big step toward making that a reality second as many of you know the
Department of Finance operates the Parking Violations Bureau which handles all 16 million parking and speed camera
violations that are issued each year in the city this operation currently relies on
a 40-year-old mainframe computer system which frankly has seen better days this is why we're investing in a
comprehensive new system that will bring our processes into the 21st century enhancements will allow us to improve
the efficiency of our hearings reduce turnaround time for decisions and allow
commercial fleet operators to electronically enroll in our fleet programs among other improvements
ultimately this investment will allow us to be more adaptive and agile to new public safety measures and to improve
the customer experience we've just kicked off the procurement for the multi-year process needed to replace the
current system we expect work to start in the early fall and to take two to three years to complete and we look
forward to keeping the council informed as we deliver this crucial upgrade in closing the Department of
Finance continues our steady yet crucial role of collecting and protecting the city's money this is my fourth year
joining you all as the commissioner for these budget hearings and I can confidently say that this is the best I
have felt as we continue to prepare for the future sadly Mr chairman this is our
last budget hearing together i've appreciated your partnership and support and that of the staff of the finance
division led by Richard Lee Emma Adv Michael Sherman and Jack Story in
particular who've all been tremendously uh uh cooperative and helpful and great to work
with thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify today and I'm
happy to take your questions thank you Commissioner um so the FY26 budget includes a million
dollars in new needs in FY25 and 6.7 million in
FY26 and increasing amounts in the outy years these new needs will fund upgrades to uh the summons tracking account
receivable system stars as well as uh a pay increase to city tax auditors and uh
the ATAS administrative tax auditors can you provide a breakdown of the improvements that will be made to stars
as well as detail the last time those systems were improved or updated
yes absolutely so from from time to time we we we make changes to the existing
SAR system to reflect uh new types or amounts of violations or other changes in the law so part of the funding is for
that for the ongoing maintenance of the current system the bulk of the funding here is for the replacement system that
I talked about which we are calling internally parking 2.0 uh and
uh the the challenge with the current system is really it's you know we lack
people who any longer who people are not trained right now in the programming language that it runs on so we have to
maintain a special uh consulting group just to work on it it's costly we were
exploring to give you one example we explored uh earlier this year uh what it
would take to write tickets against vehicle identification numbers in lie of or in addition to license plates and it
was going to cost don't quote me although I know I'm on the record here but something like $2 million and take
18 months just to make this change so that it really illustrates kind of the rigidity and the and the superanuation
of the of the current system so the bulk of the funding here is really to allow us to replace that system with a new
upgraded modern architecture and system are there are there going to be any other costs uh additional costs of
running the new system once it's fully upgraded uh you know it's going to cost some amount to operate continue to
operate uh and I don't know that we know right now what uh exactly that cost is
going to be um our goal here is to be able to lower the contract cost and to
do more of the work uh inhouse uh with our own IT staff and uh ultimately to
reduce the ongoing operating costs which right now are are very high
okay uh talk about auditors the executive budget includes uh about
$935,000 in FY25 3.7 in FY26 and the outy years uh
for the auditor paycale adjustment how much is the adjustment per auditor per year and is the pay scale adjustment
uniform across all titles well we're we're setting a new salary
schedule uh for each level so we have four we have four levels of city tax auditor one through four as well as a
group chief designation and then we have four levels of administrative tax auditor um we have setting a new scale
for every each one of those titles uh again with the goal of uh both
attracting more talent new talent as well as retaining the experienced auditors that we have um what's what's
the retention rate of auditors uh the the retention rate in in the first I
would say two years we lose something like 30 to 40% of our tax auditors and
we've become a bit of a training ground frankly for for accounting firms across the city so people come into uh the city
tax auditor positions at DOF they get some experience they become you know
valuable to other uh outside private sector firms and they get hired away at at better salaries so part of our goal
here is to make it more attractive and competitive to come to Dolphin to stay at Dolphin i wish city hall would do the
same thing for EMS and FDNY um how many applications does the DOF receive in
FY24 for the role of city tax auditor
um city tax auditor is a it's a civil service position so the process is is
that there's a list people take an exam there's a list that's established when we need to hire we have to call the list
which means we have to contact every person who's on the list and essentially invite them to a hiring hall um I'll
have to get back to you with exactly how many people showed up at the hiring hall in the past year we've hired 54 auditors
we have a new uh uh we have a sorry upcoming hiring hall in July with about
60 vacancies to fill um so you know we
have so far been successful at filling our vacancies for the most part when we've held hiring halls uh the retention
continues to be a little bit of an issue but um hopefully it's honestly slowed
down a little bit uh with the new federal administration um and we've
actually been able to hire back about a dozen or so auditors senior especially senior auditors who had left to go to
the IRS who now coming back to to the department of finance who we welcome
with open arms the office of tax enforcement that's the sheriff
no the office of tax enforcement is part of the a division of
audit excuse me division of audit and tax enforcement uh it's
essentially I it's essentially when there are audit cases that reveal evidence of criminal uh possible
criminal fraud then they get referred to the office of tax enforcement they also do their own uh investigations and
enforcement activities um more recently they have been quite involved with
operation padlock to protect as part of the sheriff's joint task force okay is that why they've gone uh over their
budgeted overtime amount by 2,000% yes the the the
the nature of the inspections on the task force has been that they are
um frequently involve overtime yes when they've been we've been sending tax enforce in addition to their regular
duties we've been sending them out uh to participate in those and often you end
up working past your normal scheduled shift if you've made an arrest or if you're in the process of processing
evidence after an inspection uh or you know things of that nature in FY24 the
Office of Tax Enforcement was budgeted at $32,586 at adoption they ended up
spending $74,72
yes okay how do we not do that again well I
think as we slow down with the uh I mean is it a headcount issue it is slight It
is partly a headcount issue it's a small staff what's the current What's the current budgeted and actual headcount
for the sheriff's department i'm going to turn well for the sheriff's department or I'm confused this is not
this is separate these guys are raiding illegal weed shops but they're not the sheriff the the office of tax
enforcement has been part of the uh the sheriff's joint compliance task force in
Operation Padlock to Protect yes okay so what what is the issue there
that they're going over their overtime by over 2,000% again I mean it it's
they're participating in the task force and the nature of the inspections uh that are conducted uh of the illicit pot
shops under operation padlock to protect is that if you are there you've you've
inspected a shop you're seizing evidence you've made an arrest etc you're going to finish the job even if it means that
you're there past your normal shift time so you're going to incur overtime given the pace of activity in the last year
especially in the first uh nine months let's say of the of the operation
padlock to protect um there was a lot of overtime incurred now as operation
padlock protect sort of winds down and we've we've closed as you know something like,400 shops um as the pace of
operations there slows down somewhat we don't necessarily expect to see those same levels of overtime going forward
i did want to if I may go back to one previous question we had uh 149
applicants candidates uh on the civil service list for city tax auditor of which we hired 54 i
think this is OT yeah the current active headcount in the office of tax
enforcement is 13 and their authorized headcount is 23 so they're they're down
in staff so that's also part of why we've
had uh some overtime how much revenue did do receive as a result of civil
forfeite following marijuana shop uh inspections in FY24 so I I'm going to
turn to uh Deputy Commissioner James to answer that question i'm sorry the civil
forfeite from the We don't we don't actually get any civil forfeite money
there's no civil for the civil forfeite program is a Mhm district Attorney uh
program who cuts the money nypd well it's it's really a district attorney program i don't know do you
So civil the civil the civil service
funding comes from the state it's a joint investigation that the sheriff
does with the district attorney they didn't have to demonstrate that they successfully got um revenues from
whatever raid that they did and then the department of the sheriff's office receives a portion of that so it's a
it's a more indepth process that happens when it comes whatever they whatever
they do get what do they do with the money have we have we receive I don't think we've received we've receive some funding and we have it in our budget and
it is used to spend on the sheriff's initiatives so currently I think we spent like
$118,000 so far on I forgot if it's radios we purchased or some other
equipments that we purchased for the sheriff's office but it has to be spent on the sheriff's initiatives
It's not it's not a huge amount of money that we've received we'll come back to you with the more complete detailed
answer okay uh in the November 23 plan DOF had
a peg for increased tax audit revenue which was projected to provide $24
million in additional revenue for FY24 and 48.7 in FY25 in the out years
this would be accomplished through the hiring of 45 additional staff um can you
provide us with an update on the uh impact of that peg if it worked it has i
think we've hired uh we we have currently of those positions filled we have 45 staff uh that was allocated to
us um and we have 31 of those currently filled um we have increased our audit
target since the beginning of the year and just most recently in the executive plan uh we recognized roughly about
deputy commissioner shift for $50 million 50 roughly $50 million in
additional audit revenue and it's now baked in that that increase is now baked into our baseline
audit projection okay uh the November 23 plan DOF had a
peg for increased tax revenue due to the removal of ineligible co-op and condo
abatement uh recipients this peg projected 7.5 million in additional tax
revenue could you tell us about that yes how much tax revenue was collected
as a result of that peg we've been um excuse me uh meeting our additional
revenue targets there in fact last year we collected uh I believe $10 million i
guess 7.5 i'm sorry Jack i'll let Jack answer this question so for our revenue target for fiscal 23 our target for 23
was 1.2 million we collected $1.3 million in tax audit revenues in fiscal
24 our target is $968 million and so far we are I'm sorry
our target is 747 million and so far we're on target for 968 that was 24 in fiscal 25 our
target is 8.25 and we've already collected $710 million how many more
ineligible apartment abatement recipients do you think there are
is there is there a burrow or a neighborhood that has higher than average rates i think Bay Ridge is really
um I don't I mean part of the we did the our tax policy group did a
review and they sort of categorized uh people at sort of levels of likelihood so for example somebody who
was receiving a co-op and condo abatement an address in the city but who was filing their tax return for the last
two years from another address outside of the city you know those people overwhelmingly
uh did not respond or actually fessed up and said "Yeah I don't actually live there." So they're uh abments were
revoked um the sort of now we're we're kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel a
little bit more and a little bit lower likelihood uh people but we continue to
do this exercise and review this uh regularly every year or every other year
to ensure that we're sort of capturing on a regular ongoing basis uh the
universe of people who may not be eligible for uh the abatement so we
heard from some constituents that they only had like a week to reply to a removal
do you want to answer that one sure okay what happens if a correction comes in after the deadline yes so we give
unit owners 30 days to respond so so not a week if um you have specific
complaints um please refer them to us so that we can review Um if mistakes were
made by us in processing we will fix them right um including if they were
made after the deadline okay um let's talk about the lean sale uh the
initial list of properties that were at risk of having their leans sold totals nearly 1.6 billion uh since then the
most recent data that we received at the council shows that amount has shrunk to about 675 million it's a change of
slightly more than $900 million of that 900 million how much in tax revenue was
actually collected so far so as you know there's a combination when when leans are removed from the
from the initial 90-day list before the sale was for a combination of reasons uh
it could include people come in and pay uh people enter a payment plan or they
turn out not to be uh they shouldn't have been on the list because they received an exemption or they they filed
an easy exit application or they you know there was some other uh error or reason why they shouldn't have been on
the list so I don't we don't have solid numbers yet we will know better numbers
by the middle of June a couple weeks after we after the final date um and I'm
more than happy to supply and update it uh for you as soon as we have those numbers so and since this is the first
lean sale in years and there's a lot more properties than we typically see um
and we've thankfully had additional funds to do greater outreach it's inevitable that some properties that
some owners will fall through the cracks so what does DOF what will DOF do if we find out after a lean is sold that a
property had deed fraud or uh tangled title issues uh any any property
that even once the lean is sold if they come to us and they say "Hey I'm in probate hey there's a dispute over the
ownership etc." We will defect that lean and we'll take the lean out okay
um I want to ask I'm asking everybody today um if you were notified about the
bit bonds before the mayor announced it in Las Vegas yes I heard about it but
you didn't he didn't tell you about it before he did i spoke with him about it before and what do you think of the idea
you know we're we're it's it's a as I said to the mayor at the time it's on the edge of sort of our experience here
and so it deserves a very thorough study um and I know that this is really OM's
world along with the controller uh so it's really on uh on those two
entities now to review this proposal and try and understand exactly what it is
that the benefits that we would get from it um and proceed obviously we have a
pretty rigorous uh framework in which we operate for issuing bonds and we have a excellent
you know credit and we don't want to harm that at all and I'm sure that there will be 100% due diligence done to
ensure that that's protected the controller mentioned that he didn't think that bit bonds would comply with
directive 10 he's he's better positioned to know that than I am so okay we I mean we believe
that crypto and bitcoins and all this nonsense is the asset class is
just infamous for chaos and uncertainty and uh you know volatility we we don't
believe that the city should be have anything to do with Bitcoin or crypto i watched earlier and I I registered
your opinion on that okay uh we have questions now from council member Williams followed by Brewer thank you
thank you hello budget equity is really important to me um not just how we spend money but also how we generate money as
a city and property taxes I know is like a thing and it's been a thing for a very
long time before I even got here um and in conversations with the state they say the city the city is supposed to tell
them what they're supposed to do upwards of speaker hasty in conversations with the city the conversation isn't always
clear um I'm sure you're watching the litigation happening with the lawsuit
with the Tenny Group um and just wondering um has your office uh done any
assessments or thought of new methodologies to make the property tax
system a little bit more equitable in New York City so as you know thank you for that
question as you know we uh the not we but the previous administration uh Mayor
Delasio and Speaker Johnson put together a advisory commission who made
recommendations uh we worked on legislation that would uh essentially
translate those into re you know deep reforms to the property tax system the
the problem with an overhaul that was that sweeping is there was a lot of disruption to taxpayers and there were
taxpayers who would have seen their bills double or triple and there were taxpayers who would have benefited but
it was a lot of change so you know we're looking now at sort taking a step back
but our goals remain the same which is to move us in the direction of greater equity to sort of to get rid of the
sources of the complaint really in the in the lawsuit uh and also to introduce
uh benefits income based benefits broadly that don't exist now i mean you
can certainly get a senior citizen home homeowner exemption or disabled homeowner exemption but if you're a
family raising if you're raising a young family and you're you know trying to buy a home the property taxes uh you don't
get any benefit right now we'd like to be able to change that and ensure that people get some benefit uh for low and
moderate income households so that they can stay in their homes or buy homes so that's the thrust of you know our
reforms uh that we're looking at
do you agree with them that New York City has the power and jurisdiction to
reform the property taxes without state intervention no uh the the basic
framework for the property tax system is set in the real property state real
property tax law so there's you know that absolutely requires the legislature to act there are very limited um powers
that we have locally uh so you know you the city council obviously can set the rates every year we uh at the department
of finance can set the assessment ratio but there's no you know there's very limited uh scope that we have for uh
making any kind of changes uh more substantively thank you um and the last question which
is very broad but I'm going to go for it um your office assesses fines for
different types of things um do you ever assess whether or not you are um finding
certain communities over other ones so in general I'm I'm going to draw a
distinction we don't ass we don't issue violations or fines uh for I mean we
will for non-payment of taxes or that kind of thing but in terms of other ECB
type violations or whatever that parking ticket etc we don't uh issue the
violations we are just in charge of collecting um I am very mindful of uh
efforts uh our collection efforts and how they are focused um we don't you
know for example in our audit process we're not interested in going after small taxpayers we're interested in going after larger taxpayers who may you
know be um not fully complying with the law uh
uh at a scale that's actually you know makes some sense for us to pursue i'm not going after someone who you know
made a small error and underpaid by $100 um as I say I think you know we're
in the property tax realm we're very constrained by state law and we really would like to we think it the best
approach here would be to change the state law in order to provide uh more tax relief to low and moderate income
homeowners um so there again it's like that's that's not fully within our hands
to change unilaterally it's not at all within our hands to change unilaterally but we want to uh work with the legislature and with you all to enact
reforms that would be beneficial we think to communities that have historically may have been overt taxed
thank you and yes I appreciate that distinction but on your end do you get
the data around where these fines are occurring and you did mention auditing so do you audit for
that so like a parking ticket like No okay no we I mean we we have information
because I know it's an enforcement side and there's probably a conversation to be had with the UIPD as an example but
you you are also kind of collecting the money yep and so wondering if you do do
any audits to determine whether or not these fines are equitably dispersed
amongst all New Yorkers i I think we have information regarding parking
tickets uh at the uh council district level let me let uh first deputy
commissioner we have information on on parking tickets at the police precinct
level oh okay um we don't have information since it is
parking tickets um we don't know the income of the motorists for example um
who have received the tickets we don't um but you know the community right so
would you and do you do you ever make those type of assessments when you have the data do you ever look and say like
"Oh I see that in council member Brewer's district we
collected x amount of dollars and in I don't know council member Steven's
district we collected x amount of dollars." Like do you look at that and
say do you make any assessments do you look at that data uh we don't routinely
do that um no we don't routinely do that mostly because it's it
It's actually the data is somewhat hard to collect that way for us so it's a bit of an effort uh but we have you know we
have the ability to do that to some extent and I can come back to you with you know some thoughts do that if I'll also say that I
know I live in council member Brewer's district and a lot more tickets could be written there i would love I would love
if we could continue this conversation because I do think it's important as a city again we want to spend our money in
equitable fashion across the burrows across communities across different demographics but I think it's also
equally important to look at how we are collecting money as well understood thank you
you mentioned um you're working on another version of uh the property tax
reform do you have a timeline of when you'd share that with the council well our goal immediately was to we we
were seeking to introduce legislation after the budget was finalized which obviously took five weeks longer than it
was supposed to um the uh our goal right now is to see if we can get a a bill
introduced this session in order to sort of put a marker down here that we are uh
pursuing reform that is going to be the beginning of a conversation whatever we put forward we know is not what's going to
get passed so our our goal here is once we get the legislation introduced then
we intend to start shopping around much more seriously and having much more
serious conversations with people about the content of the legislation um I'm not sure it's worth the effort if the
bill's never introduced at this point but you know we're happy to talk to you about it uh whatever whatever happens in Alb
we're happy to talk to you about it council member Brewer thank you first of all as I always say thank you Rita Jen
for coming to the office to talk about scree and dre it makes a huge difference i really appreciate it um along those
lines there's I don't think it's happened in Albany yet but there are some changes hopefully with CPI screed
is that something that the administration supports in Albany or you haven't taken a position i would defer
to OMB on that okay number two is I should know this but the new red light cameras speed cameras does that
information go to finance as to how many tickets are collected or does it just go the money just go to OM for red light
camera violations yes yeah it's all recorded in stars we know that okay and is it working in other words are you
getting more funding for it and are the numbers up uh you know we published a
report every year about this which I don't have in front of me what I I think I recall is that in fact red light
camera violations worked in the sense that the number of violations has started to go
down that's a good thing yeah uh but I don't have the numbers in front of me but I'll send you speed also speed um
the other thing of the ghost plates it's not just ghost plates people order plates online people from Virginia seem
to have lots of plates and people who live here uh move from another state and never get their New York state license
plate so is that's how are we addressing any of that i know it's not just you it's PD but the money we're losing
millions I would assume even just telling people maybe that's the Department of Motor Vehicles you live
here you're supposed to have a New York State license but again when they go through the cameras everywhere and get
the tickets they're not paying yeah how are we addressing that if at all very difficult honestly to address the ghost
plates particularly because again they they may not we may not have anybody on you know was associated with that issue
a ticket to right we we encounter increasingly we have encountered the
problem of people who um somebody somebody stole the plate
somebody defaced the plate so that it looks like a different plate somebody didn't take the registration sticker off
correct when they sold their car so the license the violation gets issued to the wrong owner we set up a program in the
office of the parking summons advocate where if you get five or more violations
like that that are dismissed by an ALJ then we will actually you can sign a form and we will dispute those tickets
for you as they come in so that you don't have to be dealing with them because there are cases where we've had
dozens even hundreds of tickets issued uh to a vehicle that didn't belong anymore to the owner so you know there's
uh there is definitely an issue with you know how are we recording with the DMV
correct ownership but a lot of this you know especially with def defaced or
ghost plates is very difficult to really tackle all right but I'm just All right
so we're kind of like chalking it up to can't do anything about it i I don't I
wouldn't say that because the mayor has been very uh the mayor and the and the police commissioner and the deputy mayor
for public safety have all been very much um attentive to this problem and the mayor has pushed me and others hard
on sort of what we can do here uh if I may make one public service announcement and this I will say that uh it's very
important that people remember when they sell their car to scrape the sticker take the registration sticker off okay
i'm just saying that actually bigger than ghost plates we've been looking at it with the investigation staff of
oversight and investigations and it's you know selling the license plate out of the back of the car from Virginia and
then all the people who live here who are not from New York uh weren't from New York and they don't change their
license plate it is Virginia i don't know why but I think it's Virginia anyway long story short and I don't see
any public service announcement as you suggest from the state I guess would be or even from you move here you got to
change your license but they don't because those aren't those folks aren't getting there's no reciprocal agreement
so they're not paying either i think we'd be actually happy if you're doing work on this in the in your committee uh
council member we'd be happy to like get together and talk to you about what you're finding and and see if we uh you know brainstorm some thoughts about how
to address this because it's a definitely a a difficult problem to solve okay then I might you know 2.1
billion uh taxes in our paid i know that the controller went through some you
know it's definitely a problem is there anything new about how we can collect some of this 2.1 billion is that
something that is it's everything it's fines it's oath it's these taxes that I these plates I just mentioned
etc i I think one of the biggest challenges here is that
when especially if it's issued against a business uh the business goes out of business or
the business dissolves and reinccorporates in another form it's very hard for us to track down ownership
in that case so I think that's one of the largest reasons why we are unable to
collect on a certain percentage of outstanding business taxes or ECB debt
or other you know or also property based charges like sanitation charges etc um
so that's you know we have a very robust uh collections process i like to say
every now and then that our collections staff brings in more per capita than our audit staff does every year uh they
bring in last year $600 million in collections of outstanding business taxes parking tickets ECB debt so uh you
know we are constantly they're very good they're very managed very well by
assistant commissioner Pam Parker CHO they uh are always innovating and trying
to find programs and and methods to uh help increase our collection rate so do
you hire um consultants to do collection or are you doing it in-house we have outside we have uh I don't remember the
exact number we have nine outside consultant contracts um one for each type of debt
business ECB and parking and we have three uh three agencies for each type
and so for example we'll refer we refer each uh
outstanding debt to the first collection agency and then they have it for six
months then it goes to the second collection agency and then it goes to the third collection agency so you know
we added a third collection agency just last year or two years ago and that uh
has improved our collection rate so so they're making you're making money more
than what you're paying them I assume in terms of collection absolutely all right thank you
okay thank you all very much thank you
okay we will hear from IBO starting at 3:30
okay good afternoon and welcome to the final portion of FY26 budget hearings
day 13 council member Brandon I chair the committee on finance welcome to Director Chaffy and your team thank you
for joining us today uh from the independent New York City independent budget office my questions will largely
focus on IBO's analysis of our uh employment growth the home healthcare
employment federal tax changes business tax forecasts our reserves and state budget risks uh just a reminder we're
only accepting written testimony today after IBO testifies and we ask questions
we will be concluding this hearing so if you wish to submit written testimony for the record you can email it to
testimony@counsel.nyc.gov and you could do that anytime up to 72 hours after the conclusion of today's hearing i'm now
going to turn and we joined still by council members Brewer and Williams thank you for hanging in there with us
we'll now turn it over to committee council Brian Saro to swear you in and we can get started
good afternoon uh do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this committee and
to respond honestly to council member questions director Chaffy I do and
officer Subraman subraman yes Subraman i do thank you
okay you me again thank you thank you uh good afternoon um uh Council Finance
Committee Chair Brennan and members of the committee i hope you are enjoying your cookies i'm Louisa Chaffy director
of the Independent Budget Office and I'm joined here today by my colleague Serita Sub Romanian the senior research and
strategy officer we appreciate the opportunity to testify um so we'd like to talk about
the context ibo issued its report on the executive budget and the accompanying
financial plan on May 20th under unusual circumstances which included turmoil at
the federal level including cuts in spending layoffs of uh including cuts in
spending layoffs of staff erratic implementation of tariffs and draconian
immigration issues to name a few and this was further complicated by the
mayor's silence around these and many other issues the absence of a state
enacted budget which caused the city's executive budget to include only placeholder dollar amounts the continued
budget dance by the Adams administration including simultaneous reinstatement of
funding reductions from prior years recognition of the end of co 19 aid and
more under and over budgeting in various categories and all of this is occurring
in a competitive election year our basic findings so ibo's forecast of tax
revenues which is 79.7 billion in 25 and 81 billion in 26
do not vary significantly from OM's forecast in those two years of the financial plan but ibo BO's estimates
savings on the expenditure side of 1.9 billion in 2025 in all these adjustments
net an additional surplus in 25 of 1.7 billion and larger gaps in the rest of
the financial plan window 7.2 billion in 27 7.9 billion in 28 and 7.1 billion in
29 those gaps are on average 7% of city tax revenues this is larger than the
gaps the city has closed in recent years which were around four to six% of city
tax revenues um as you uh the city council
or talk about next steps in negotiating the adop adopted budget IBO suggests
that the city council and the Adams administration weigh how to allocate the current year surplus across two options
one is to use funds to prepay next year's expenses and the second is
placing funds into reserves while prepayment may offer short-term flexibility and offset existing costs it
does not address the root cause of those costs placing funds into reserves
provides more ability to address future shocks and requires the city to address cost overruns in the out years ibo has
identified surplus funds in 2025 meaning that funds could be added to reserves
without decreasing planned spending in the executive budget further exercise of
fiscal discipline with respect to near-term expenses like uniformed overtime could free up additional funds
which could be placed into reserves so we appreciate you keeping in mind that
federal dollars compromise 10.5 billion or 9% of the city's 119 billion bud
dollar budget this year and 7.4 billion or 6% of the budget for
2026 state dollars compromise two 20.7 billion of the city's 2025 budget which
is about 17% and again those amounts are subject to change because the do numbers
were placeholders um in addition to the federal amounts and the state federal
amounts in our budget we also would like to remind you of health and hospitals and the New York City Housing Authority
which are overwhelmingly federally funding dependent new York State's fiscal year 2025 enacted budget of 252
billion included 87 billion in federal funding that's 35% of their total state
budget and the majority of that is Medicaid at about 58% some of the federal funds that are
part of the 17% allocated by the state to the city um are those funds that
support our health and human services now as the US Senate takes up the Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by
the House IBO is paying particular attention to proposed cuts in areas such
as Medicaid supplemental nutrition assistance program and temporary assistance for needy families beyond
impacted programs let's talk about New Yorkers according to the Census Bureau 30% 7% of New York City residents are
foreign born based on the state controllers data close to four million New Yorkers in the city utilize Medicaid
and over 1.6 have health insurance through the essential plan both programs
that are centrally targeted for reduction in January 2025 1.8 million
New Yorkers statewide received benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program totaling over $423
million for that month alone and that's money that kept people fed and supported
New York businesses these are a few examples of people facing potentially
major changes in in the in their central existence food and healthcare due to
federal changes assuming federal legislation
dramatically reduces funding to the state the city will need to convene a special session to account for those
reductions in federal dollars and increased hardship for millions of New
Yorkers this in turn would require the city to consider how to spend how to continue to provide essential services
to vulnerable New Yorkers with that with less funding while maintaining a balanced budget as required by law so
back to our report given this situation IBO emphasizes three takeaways the first
is given the scale of federal funding cuts combined with decisions to slash academic funding implement severe
limitations on immigration and impose huge and erratic tariffs the time to
increase the city's reserve fund is now
two the New York State's policy choices have passed fiscal pressure to the city
only 328 million for child care vouchers was funded approximately 1th3 of the 1
billion requested by the administration in addition New York State's foundation
aid formula resulted in smaller increases for the New York City Department of Education so in addition
to needing to find city funds to accommodate those state choices the time
to increase the city's reserve funds is now lastly this the administration
continues budget practices that increase internal risks these take the form of
underbudgeting whether it be for unifor uniformed overtime which is at 658
million addition in 2026 or the Department of Education's due process cases formerly known as Carter cases for
258 million additional or shelter provision rental and cash assistance
which are collectively at 1.4 four billion in 2026 andor overbudgeting uh
where under the two for one hiring policy the city has quote achieved savings both directly on personnel
924 million25 but also by reducing capacity to spend on other programmatic
funds a continued dependence on prepayment to offset next year's
expenditures and remember the proportion of prepayment continues to shrink yet
each year making this mechanism less and less effective further
um delays in payments on to the nonprofit providers the city controllers estimate um um anticipates over 1
billion currently in unpaid invoices so that's providers under contract without
their bills being paid so again the time to increase the city's reserve funds is
now given these three areas of uncertainty it's hard to describe this
executive budget as the best budget ever thank you for the opportunity to testify
and we are happy to answer any questions thank you very much
um as stated in the your analysis of the financial plan uh IBO expects weaker
employment growth in the city compared to OM's projection so while OM forecasts
about 58,000 more jobs in 2025 fourth quarter to fourth quarter IBO expects an
anemic 32,000 uh more jobs um OMB forecasts
79,000 more jobs in 2026 while IBO expects only 52,000 um your office
explains its weaker employment forecast is partially based on recent data showing a sharp uh decline in tourism
especially international are there any other factors that would suggest weaker job growth than what's uh been projected
by OM well it's it's the last hearing of the
day and we're trying to not be too giddy i'm sure you're feeling the same way but we do we have internally considered
whether there might not be an element of election year optimism involved in some of those numbers sure and I would I
would add that um in general I think the projections for job growth are um you
know slowing substantially across all sectors so um but in particular I think
that's one area where uh our projection differs from what the administration is assuming
so I asked OMB earlier about uh the home healthcare employment and the what the changes to CD CDPAP management will mean
for uh the city's home healthcare job growth does Owen does uh IBO have a
position on that uh yes so we do anticipate um some nearterm growth to
continue although not quite at the pace that it has been historically uh but we do anticipate uh longer term um less
growth for home healthcare because of this CDPAP transition
okay um in your recently released port report you touched on the potential
impact of the proposed uh federal tax changes on city tax revenues and and our
residents uh the report mentions the proposal to limit states use of a pass through entity tax by restricting
certain pass through businesses ability to fully deduct their PTA payments um while the proposed limitation on PET
would not have any impact on city uh state and city personal income tax collection it would raise federal tax
liabilities for city residents who utilize uh PTE are you concerned about
how this proposed limitation would change taxpayer behavior if it were to pass
yes have you done any analysis that that quantifies the potential impact on the
city economy we have not yet uh we will once we have data that's dependent for
let's say 48 hours um okay the business tax forecast ibo is
projecting weaker business tax revenues in the administration about $190 million less this year and 275 million less in
the upcoming fiscal year your report mentions that your forecast is based on April 2025 indicators uh however
economic conditions have certainly shifted since April um with this tariff chaos and uh so-called trade deals and
tax changes um how different would your forecast look if you were to use current economic indicators as we head into June
um I would say that based on the um indicators that have been released since our forecast um we feel um relatively
comfortable with where we're at right now which is that um growth would slow
uh pretty substantially although uh we did not um forecast a recession and so I
would say that likely would be um where we would um forecast if we were to
repeat it now but that is something that we're um continuing to look at and obviously you know as Louisa said news
changes hour to hour so uh we will factor all that in can you summarize the
areas where IBO has identified additional surplus FY24 resources that
that could be used for reserves or prepayment uh yeah so we mentioned as Louisa
mentioned in the testimony um in particular personnel uh costs and so uh
we estimate uh over 900 million there um we also are projecting lower costs for
asylum seekers uh we project uh we because a lot of the population is now
in DHS as opposed to um health and hospitals we are projecting um slower
costs uh or decreased costs um to align more closely with um DHS shelter costs
for those asylum seekers so those are two areas um that we noted in the report
i would say another area that we have thought about um are other than personnel service costs um and that's an
area that uh you know is largely uh if it's not spent by this time in the year
um is an area where the city could look to um you know get additional savings
without um direct service uh in interference so there's often a fair
amount of cushion built into basic things like paper and supplies and chairs etc and this is the quarter where
that kind of money could be um in effect redeployed without great impact to any
level of operations uh I asked OM if they could give us an
estimate of what they think the hiring freeze had quote unquote saved us do do you have any analysis on
that m okay no no not not currently and
lastly what areas within the state budget do you does IBO see as the big the biggest risks to our budget
well we outlined the childcare vouchers and the foundation aid um yeah I would
say those uh as well as you know Medicaid um as Louisa mentioned is one
that we um are looking to see in particular um assuming that the approval
to the transition from um the indigent care um pricing to uh the direct uh
directed payment um it will not be approved uh we're looking to see what actions uh the state might take in terms
of uh going back to session to um allow for ICP to be to continue um and then
obviously the um the announcement about the um the waiver um you know being
taken back and that also being implemented on a pace that's um a lot faster than what would traditionally
happen um and that you know normally I think uh the federal government in those circumstances would give states you know
longer of time frame to adjust and it sounds like that'll be about 6 months for the state so
what do you guys think of the mayor's bit bond idea oh we're so glad you asked um we surprisingly IBO was not consulted
in advance do you think the city of New York should have have anything to do with investing
in crypto or Bitcoin uh so we would defer to the controllers's advice in that circumstance okay my colleagues
have any questions council member Brewer thank you um I know I always ask the same question but um I know you did an
analysis a while ago of those taxes and parking fines and so on that could not be collected i just didn't know there
was any update i've asked others about it and it's I think everybody's trying and the finance has got I think nine
collection agencies and staff trying but I just didn't know if you've done any updated on that topic uh we have not yet
done an updated analysis okay and the other question I have is with the um
when you you did such a great analysis here of the state and federal u and the
exact numbers as to what is or is not there um I know this is a hard question
but how do you think or when do you think when would it be appropriate for the city to make some decisions about
this obviously between now and the end of June I assume you might say but how are we going to how do you look at this
federal cut um so we suggest to add money to the reserves in advance of what
we believe to be severe federal cuts but we also recognize that the new acronym
Taco may apply on some level and uh that there may be far less but then
better to have reserves and be able to deploy them in future years and other ways um if this process goes through as
anticipated as outlined in the testimony we would expect um the state shortly
after the Senate finishes to have to go into special session and that the city
quite quickly after that would then also need to um adjust its um anticipated
expenditures so that probably by November decisions will have been made and that's when the feds will know more
too that they're what we're doing with Um in terms of education um is there anything that you could add because of
your expertise there in terms of education either from what the state did or didn't give us or from um you know
what could happen in in Washington and we're obviously concerned about the two billion we're concerned in my situation
about the migrants um I would love them to stay in the Department of Education i
feel so strongly about that i just was wondering if there's anything you want to add about education uh yeah so I
would um agree with you on um particularly funds for um immigrant
students so title three um is something that we're paying close attention to um
in terms of the uh you know the additional costs we project for education i think class size uh remains
to be the one cost um that we anticipate especially in 27 and out years um I know
I know the department has added some funds and we're um working to update our estimate of that uh as well um but I I
think actually what's uh unique about our analysis this time is that um you
know the the challenges in ACS with the child care vouchers are trumping a lot of the um additional education um costs
that we're estimating so I would say childcare vouchers is a really critical area right obviously the state put in
money it's not clear even though we heard earlier that it's there it's not completely clear what the city's putting
in terms of uh vouchers for the uh housing
yeah that came up in the sense that we have X dollars uh I think that the DSS
commissioner indicated that she uh is you know feels we'll save $11 million
but there's a concern that people um have to pay more for their voucher and
so they may end up going back to shelter that's what the nonprofits think is that
something that you've looked at in terms of what the future could be for those with housing vouchers uh we did not
factor that into um our estimate um so but that is something that would
certainly um make uh an impact in terms of uh the number of vouchers that are
issued right okay thank you Council Member Williams thank you um I
know I've spoken to you about this already but budget equity and I look forward to figuring out how um we could
look into this from your office and I know you were here when Department of
Finance testified around the parking tickets so from your vantage point do
you believe there are ways to assess how we are both generating revenue and
spending money based off of um different demographics and geographical locations
in New York City and does Ibo in their work look at this in any of their
assessments or reports um so to date we have not looked at a
geographic spread or um the geographic v variation of collections of fees and
fines although as councilwoman Brewer um referred to we have been looking really closely at the total and where they're
coming from and and what has and has not been collected um but we would be happy to investigate this area further thank
you yes I look forward to us doing that i have a lots of ideas um Department of Sanitation is another place and our
deputy speaker has been mentioning that a lot in the hearings around not being able to assess or understand how
Department of Sanitation chooses to allocate said funds to different garages
um so yes I look forward to talking to you more about this the other question I have because you were very clear that
this is a great time to put money into the reserves I'm glad you understood And again I'm sure you were listening to
OMB's hearing earlier and um Jacques said something very interesting he said
two things that I thought was interesting one thing he said was um essentially they don't want to tip the
city's hand right they don't want to give off this this impression that you know we have the money and we can deal
with cuts um and then he also kind of alluded to this idea that it kind of
doesn't matter if we put things in reserve funds because there's no way that the city could um cover any type of
potential federal loss so how do you kind of explain uh and further double down on the need
to put away money in the reserve funds because I think he was again clear on two things like one this idea of like we
don't want to um create this narrative that could be used against us but then
this other thing that I kind of took from it was like it doesn't really matter because we don't have enough
money anyway to be able to fill in the gap
um uh uh as nobody knows what the gap is um it would be very hard to pretend that
we have enough money to fill in the gap so our recommendation to add money to
reserves is simply to have money to lessen the blows when they come uh we
are not under the impression that the Trump administration is perusing the city's reserve funds as they make
decisions about uh immigration policy or cuts to human services or changes to
academic funding in New York City which then resolve in lesser tax collections
and the many other policy changes that are being made perhaps director Xiha has more insight as to what the Trump is
administration is considering as they make their policy changes i would also add that uh you know I
think one thing we point out is that um our estimates for example um you know
uniformed overtime do assume the same level of expenditure year-over-year and
that's one area that we've identified could be you know if if better management practices were put in place
those costs uh would be lower and that would um reduce the the gap in the
future so um and again with some of these areas of um additional savings
that we highlighted um could also affect uh or bring down that gap right and I'm
actually going to build on what my colleague just said so um as Serita mentioned one thing that is unusual in
many of the federal changes right now is that they are being enacted immediately or close to
immediately generally they're stepdowns in time and when a a government is
making reduction choices it recognizes that for example uh partners like in the
nonprofit community providing services who are obliged to lessen need to have
time to meaningfully reduce those services so that the employees and the clients can be as best taken care of so
money in reserves could lessen how much is reduced andor allow for a time for a
reasonable close down as opposed to doing it in say 30 days which is what city contracts basically allow thank you
and what do you feel is the appropriate size for the reserve fund
um well what a wonderful question uh so we have debated this question amply
internally um and we are quite sure that more is better um we don't really know
we don't feel that there's a general number and the reality is there's no number that the city could set aside that would genuinely compensate for what
might be cut but I'm going to give a couple different um ideas uh best
practices of household management financial management and the city's budget is not a household but just a a
vague equivalent is to have about six months um of general sa spending on in
savings now as um Councilman Brandon knows because of the request of what does it cost to operate the city for a
day you basically take the city budget divide it by 365 and there's each day's cost uh so that is significantly more
money than we believe could be found to be put into reserves another Do you have
a dollar amount of that cuz we have six months how much would it cost us to run
the city for six months half of 119 billion yeah like 50 billion okay yeah
so another another thing to think about is that six months of the city's payroll
is about 25 billion um right now we have give or take 2 to 8 billion in reserves
so you know just we're just we don't have an answer but we're trying to think about generally what might be a better
target and when do you think it's appropriate to draw down from the reserve fund
when it's raining really hard thank you
thank you very much Ibo appreciate all you guys do thank you thank you
okay with that FY26 executive budget hearings is done thank you very much
everybody
