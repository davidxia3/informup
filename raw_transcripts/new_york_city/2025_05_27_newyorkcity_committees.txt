to be joined for the first portion of this hearing by my colleague Council Member Sandy Nurse who chairs the
committee on criminal justice we've been joined so far this morning by council members Sanchez Lewis Carr and Moya uh
welcome to First Deputy Commissioner Francis Torres um and your team thank
you for joining us today to answer our
questions financial plan for FY26 to 29 with a
prop 26 budget of 115.1 billion doc's
proposed FY26 budget of 1.21 billion represents less than 1% of the
administration's proposed budget in the executive plan this is
$869,000 less or 0.1% from the amount originally budgeted in the preliminary
plan back in January the decrease is attributed to staffing transfers a
decrease in the heat light and power budget and motor fuel the executive plan also includes an additional baselining
for collective bargaining and the lightning law discovery sharing platform
as of March 2025 DOC had uh a little over 1500 vacancies relative to its FY25
budgeted headcount my questions today will largely focused on on DOC staffing levels the large increase in overtime
the capital budget vacancy rates agency program funding and general budget
changes but I now want to turn over to my co-chair for this hearing Council Member Nurse for her opening statement
good morning everyone thank you chair Brandon uh thank you to all the DOC
leadership who have joined us today please give our regards to the commissioner hope she's feeling well um
today I plan to focus on how the mayor's executive budget for the department of correction supports the overall plan to
close Rikers and transition to the burough bailbased jail system as well as
how holistic criminal justice reform policies provide appropriate resources to ensure proper programming is provided
and divert people away from the criminal justice system in the fiscal 2026 executive plan
DOC has a total budget of 1.21 21 billion which supports 8,85 budgeted
positions the plan includes several changes including funding for overtime adjustments virtual visitation platforms
and federal funding for opioid and substance abuse programs among among other important topics which I plan to
explore today in my line of questions the mayor's Office of Criminal Justice recently released an update to the 2019
points of agreement which is a list of commitments that must be met in order to be able to properly and safely close
Riker's Island i intend to ask about the DOC's involvement and clarify many of
the updates that are directly impacted by the policies and actions of the department i want to thank our committee

good morning Chair Nurse Chair Brandon and members of the committees on
criminal justice and finance i am Francis Torres first deputy commissioner
of the New York City Department of Correction my colleagues and I are here to discuss the department's executive
budget for fiscal year 2026 and what lies ahead for the agency in the coming
year when Lenel McGin Liiti was appointed commissioner she committed herself to
leading this agency under the guiding principles of service compassion and
respect so that both staff and people in custody have their voices uplifted and
feel safe in our jails she has made it clear to staff on all
levels that she expects the same from them and they have delivered no matter
the challenges we are facing most recently the department has
experienced an unexpected increase in the census driven in large part by the
New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision temporarily
suspending intake of state ready individuals due to the wildcat strike
today we have over 7,600 individuals in custody compared to
approximately 6,300 this time last year in contrast we
have approximately 5,900 uniform members of service to manage the jails and other
critical operations compared to over 6,200 last year
despite this dedicated staff across all divisions have risen to the call and
throughout this challenge we have ensured that all people coming into our
care have a bed and can be safely housed during this period important
violence indicators have continued to trend downward we continue to
collaborate with partners throughout the criminal justice system to ensure people in custody are moving expeditiously
through the court process and are not lingering in our custody longer than
they should our commissioner has said it before and I will say it on her behalf
this morning heroes work here at the New York City Department of Correction
we remain laser focused on recruiting and supporting staff to do this
challenging and important work in March of this year over 100 new recruits
graduated from the DOC Academy and became part of the Boldest
family and we have a new class starting at the end of this week last week we
held an exam for correction captains and hope to promote dedicated members of
service into critical frontline leadership positions where they will
support and mentor correction officers and help shape the culture of our
agency our commissioner has stated repeatedly that leadership
matters all promotional classes for supervisors have several leadership
development components built leadership focus as a foundation
for all leadership development within the agency
it's incredibly important that we foster the next generation of correctional leaders to carry the important work of
reform forward for decades to come at the beginning of this month we
celebrated National Correctional Officers and Employees Week as part of
the celebrations and in furtherance of our efforts to support our staff we
opened four additional wellness centers to promote more opportunities for them
to focus on their well-being recharge and show up as their best selves
it is imperative that we uplift and honor the dedicated public servants who
give so much of themselves to keep our city safe not just for one week but each
and every day finally before turning to the budget
we would like to highlight several exciting initiatives that are coming to fruition in the next fiscal year
we have been working diligently to meaningfully expand programs and
services in critical areas which were chosen based on a number of factors but
most importantly input from people in custody and our staff providers have
been selected and we anticipate an announcement soon with services
beginning in the coming weeks we're also looking forward to rolling out Lightning Law discovery sharing
platform lightning Law will allow the efficient and confidential sharing of
records between clients and their attorneys through electronic devices
we are hopeful that this technological innovation will support speedier case
processing and better justice outcomes which benefits
everybody we are procuring a new virtual visitation platform aimed at improving
the visit process for attorneys and those visiting their loved ones in jail
this new platform will allow attorneys to more easily schedule virtual meetings
with incarcerated clients and discuss case updates these measures will help
modernize our jails provide better access to critical services and
ultimately improve outcomes for those who are in our care
now we will briefly turn to the fisc year 2026 executive budget as of the
fisc year 2026 financial plan the department's budget is
1.3 billion the vast majority of this
87% is allocated for personal services and 13% for other than personnel
services the fiscal year 2026 executive budget
increased by 288 million compared to fiscal year
2025 adopted budget of 1.0 billion
some of the increases of the budget of the executive budget include a federal
grant funding for the Bureau of Justice Assistance Comprehensive Opioid Stimulant and
Substance Use Sitebased Program with allowances of 10,000 in fiscal year
2025 an additional 586,000 in fiscal year 2026 6 and
340,000 in fiscal year 2027 respectively this grant will help expand
substance misuse services for department's high-risk high needs
population through the addition of five substance misuse counselors
we receive an additional 1 million baseline funding beginning in fiscal
year 2026 for Lightning Law also in fiscal year 2026 we received
$1.4 million for the virtual visitation webbased platform that will
improve virtual visits the fiscal year 2025
executive capital commitment plan totals 14.6 billion which covers fiscal years
2025 through 2035 as of the fiscal year 2026
executive financial plan most of the capital funding is tied to the
borrowbased jail program which totals 13.9 billion over the 10-year plan and
is allocated as follows brooklyn facility 2.3 billion
manhattan facility 4.1 billion bronx facility 3.1 billion Queens facility
four billion we continue to work diligently
to attract and retain both civilian and uniform staff the total authorized
headcount is 8,810 which includes
7,60 uniform positions and 1,750 civilian positions our actual
uniform staffing levels remain well below our authorized headcount and the
department plans to use the new needs approved for recruitment and advertisement in the preliminary budget
to aggressively advertise and utilize marketing strategies to promote
recruitment we continue to welcome the council's support promoting job
opportunities within their networks as we look at the year ahead we
celebrate the heroes that work at the department when we think of a hero we
think of someone who is courageous and selfless someone who puts others needs
before their own that's what a hero does that's who
correction officers are they are the backbone of our collective
achievements over the past 130 years and they will continue to be a
powerful force for hope and transformation in the years to
come over the past fiscal year we have made progress in spite of many
challenges because that's what the boldest do the work we do is difficult
and yet crucial it is vital to this city
commissioner Mcini Liri our team and I and all the heroes that work alongside
us remain committed to this important work thank you for the opportunity to
testify today my colleagues and I are available to answer your questions
thank you Commissioner uh quickly we've been joined by council members Powers Norcis and Ayala uh I want to dive right
into staffing and overtime so last year uh DOC's adopted budget included uh
132.7 million for overtime at the end of the fiscal year the department's
overtime spending was approximately 281 million uh in the executive plan the
department has increased their personnel budget uh by 192 million which DOC has
stated is currently around 95% overtime funding so how much of this additional
funding has been allocated for overtime good morning Chair Brandon good morning
if you allow me I would like our assistant commissioner assigned to finance assistant commissioner Zabir to
go into the specifics sure good morning thank you for the question faison Zubar assistant commissioner of
financial operations and budget administration uh we have approximately 180 million uh
allocated towards overtime funding with the new needs that we received not new needs but uh additional overtime funding
okay and then at the end of the fiscal year your overtime spending was around
281 million is that right
that is correct okay so that's a hund00 million less than this 180 do you think you're going to blow past that
uh our expected projection by the end of the fiscal year is approximately 337 so
yes we do anticipate that
okay so wait explain that $337 million number is what uh is our anticipated
fiscal year 25 overtime expenditures and was the department's annual pattern
of actual overtime spending doubling the budgeted amount the main reason for the increase
I'm sorry can you repeat the question can you was DOC's annual pattern of actual overtime spending doubling the
budgeted amount the reason for that increase
um I'm not 100% It might be i'm not I'm not 100% sure
i'm sorry i mean is it still a priority for this administration to lower overtime spending chair if I may you're
absolutely correct every effort is being made by our department to ensure compliance with mayoral directive
2024 to explain to you what initiatives we've established within our department
to reduce the overtime i would like to introduce you to Bureau Chief Chief of Staff Rembert who will speak to our
efforts good morning thank you for the question
i am Sher Rembert uh the Bill Chief Chief of Staff New York City Department Correction as you know um sir we are
currently facing a staffing crisis uh uh the city hold of
um hiring for for years expecting a population increase but it has only grown our agency operates the entire
system not just for facilities um housing areas and or course of hospital
we rely on all personnel for operation efficiency in calendar year of 2024 634
uniform members of service are treated that's out of that is 578 correction officers 44 captains as
of April of 2025 212 correction officers
are eligible to retire however in also in 2025 up until
today,4 did retire by the end of calendar year of 25 a total of 419
additional correction officers will be eligible to retire by the end of calendar year 2026 a total of
716 additional correction officer will be eligible to retire with saying all of
that we continue to do everything possible to reduce the overtime by
keeping in mind it's paramount to have a safe jail and ensuring our staff have a quality of life and working diligently
in a balancing safety security for our persons in custody as well as our staff
we are using a multi-prong approach working hand in hand to reduce overtime
implement measures to optimize our staff coverage enhance operational efficiency
and maintain fiscal discipline so we begin by reinforcing controls on overtime usage which is
tracked by the office of administration we assigned a dedicated administrative personnel tasked specifically with
oversight and management of of our of our AW walls and personal emergency we
are developing an approval a process for an unauthorized post um the SEOC did help us out and
collaborate with us and they conducted a um post analysis one of our facilities
we are waiting and standing by for approval for that we also restrategized
our redeployments efforts um we enforce our bi-weekly
redeployment assignment for personnels for ancillary post such as the hospitals
um housing areas um schedule scheduled medical appointments as well as mandated
services we increase our redeployment frequency from one week weekly to two
twice a week for our temporary duty assignment officers also we
um we stagger the temporary duty officers on the weekends one one day a
week and one day on the weekends so that we have coverage on the weekends which would that that would increase
our that will increase our um housing area uh staffing ratio
we collaborated with our MAPS teams which is the office of management analysis and planning to advance our
automated systems so that we get a dashboard so that we see real time where we see what where our staff are doing
triples to reduce the unstaffed post and make sure triples and overtime is managed
effectively um this dashboard actively assists commands and reducing triple
tours by identifying excess excessive hours promptly uh we it also provides
commanding uh leadership with immediate visibility into leadership and excuse me
into staffing patterns for facilitating proactive uh response and intervention
we also have pre-approvals for overtime for staff members that are uh restricted for overtime so before they go do
overtime um they have to get pre-approval by the office of administration the office of
administration is do conducting audits to ensure that um all the um affformention mentioned is um in
compliance okay um back in the preliminary budget hearing you were asked if the department um had conducted
an analysis of how many uniform positions could be safely performed by civilians i think you told us at the
time that you'd have the numbers soon do you have uh the results of that analysis what did it find
so we have worked with SEOC to do the staffing analysis for the uniform
members when it comes to our um civilian we have civilian lines we have
established a committee that continues to do that analysis we have in fact
transitioned some uniform members already back into the jails to assume what we call significant um PIC facing
posts this the committee continues to work the deputy commissioners or leaders
to each of the divisions have until the end of this month meaning until the end
of this week to basically do what they need in order for us to then look into
closely how it is that we're able to remove uniform members but in removing
uniform members we need to ensure that we have civilian lines that they can
actually utilize to replace those uniform members so it is ongoing chair
Brennan when we are in a better place we'll be more than happy to share with you and the rest of the committee okay
so as of March we can see that there were around 244 vacant civilian positions is that
number still accurate or or have any of those been filed as you well know the vacancies in civilians are very fluid
you always have on boarding of civilian staff and those that retired or also
moved to other agencies we still have approximately 250 vacancies however you have more than
you had in March yes because of people either moving to different agencies or
retiring the good thing is and I put I would like to put that positive spin as
we come to you this morning is that currently we have over
152 different persons that are being onboarded by our department and so they
are in different stages of the hiring process meaning some of them are still
being vetted by our agency while others are being approved by OM okay so the
preliminary plan included over $4 million in baseline funds for uh
recruitment advertising for corrections officers will there be any recruitment funding uh or any of that money used for
civilian positions we are still concentrating on the
largest of forces that are departing our agency which which area do you have the
highest which area do you have the highest vacancy the highest vacancy that we have is the uniform members sir okay
and and what about the civilian vacancy rates what what area so there are three
specific areas that have a large one that's facility ma uh maintenance
because of the different labor trades that we have in place the other one
happens to be the division of programs and community partnerships but the deputy commissioner has been actively
doing the job postings doing the hiring pools as well as conducting interviews
and submitting the recommendations for hire and then followed by health affairs
health affairs the challenge there is a little different that's more concentrating on cooks that are part of
our nutritional services unit okay i want to talk a little bit about
capital funding then I'm going to turn over to the chair nurse um so DOC repeatedly responds that major
renovations and capital repairs are not possible due to the impending closure of Rikers within the 5-year lifespan uh
requirement are you aware is DOC aware that the department can apply for a waiver from the controllers's office to
wave the 5-year lifespan provision thank you for the question uh we do we
are aware and wherever we can we do uh uh seek a waiver have you applied for
that waiver we have applied to waivers not to the controllers's office but to Dcast instead that's that's
usually where we reach out to for for our 5year span waivers um
so are you are you saying you're not eligible for capital funds in general we we're not in general we have capital
funding to uh further capital projects and improvements if we need to however
on average whenever we uh seek uh additional capital funding or approval
for the ones the capital projects that we have uh our waiverss are not sufficient because of um the impending
uh closure of Rikers okay because I believe that under
directive 10 you can apply for a waiver to the controllers's office and wave the 5-year lifespan provision for capital
projects do you do you not agree with that that assessment we we were not
aware of that but we could look into it
okay um we've been joined by council members Marte Wrestler and Brooks Powers i'm going to turn over to chair nurse
thank you thanks chair um before I
uh ask a few questions on behalf of the speaker I just want to clarify so what can you give uh for the record the types
of capital projects that you've applied for a waiver to Dcast about and just so we can understand the the size of them
uh so uh we generally get waiverss for every kind of capital project going forward uh have you won any of them i'm
sorry have you been able to move forward with any of them uh in the past we have but recently for for instance we'll take
fencing for example when we request waiver waivers for fencing uh we are told that because of the impending
closure of Rikers those waivers despite receiving them uh they're not eligible anymore and they're not perimeter
fencing I'm sorry for what type of fencing in the outside exterior or interior i believe it's perimeter
fencing okay um what other types of large capital that you've you've been rejected for um right now it's just been
that and it's been recently but I I would have to look into it further to be able to it would be great if in the followup uh can you give us u maybe like
the last two years of things that you've applied for waiverss on of course we could we get that big and small thank
you um questions uh on behalf of the
speaker um we all are aware of the points of agreement i won't go into the preamble on it um we just got a
wonderful Friday afternoon update from Mach on the status update on those most of those some of them
um are in the direct jurisdiction of DOC and I'd like to ask um did you assist in
providing updates for your department to that uh update that Mockj gave us
we're going to have Assistant Commissioner Maldonado address your question thank you
good morning um my name is Alex Maldonado and I oversee the buroughbased jail program on behalf of the department
but I also participate um in uh providing updates to the points of agreement uh with our partners at Mark J
okay so you did Yes yes in fact you did insist in providing updates for the department for the one that came on
Friday yes ma'am okay um there's a question here on are people
in custody and Rikers receiving five errors five hours of programming every day as per BOC's minimum standards
i would um I yes they are and I would turn it over to our deputy commissioner for programming uh Nell McCarti if you'd
like further detail
hello my name is Nell McCarti i'm the deputy commissioner for the division of programs and community partnerships uh
so thank you for your question and uh yes people in custody are afforded access to 5 hours of programming but
it's important to note that while afforded um they have the opportunity to
decline um engagement in certain programs so on any given day uh based on
what a person is opting in to engage in it may not look like they are engaging in 5 hours of prayer okay i no thank you
for that um clarification we just ask every time because we know that we've heard that not everyone is getting
access we've we ask this pretty much every single time before it had been questions of staffing and capacity so
for everybody who wants to opt into 5 hours of programming um is that
available to them there are various mechanisms of programs that are available to them okay thank you um has
the RFP for the new in custody programming contracts been posted yet yes i think you mentioned some of that
in your testimony yes actually we're very happy and I'll have Deputy Commissioner Mccardi elaborate what we
thought was going to be a very speedy process going through the challengebased
procurement has demonstrated that it took a little longer but DC Marti will give you the very good news yes so uh
they were posted in January 6th of 2025 uh the um the deadline for the RFP was
February 21st of 2025 we have identified and selected vendors for each of the
RFPs they have all been made aware that they have been selected as the vendors and we're working with them closely on
ensuring um that we are closing the gap on anything with their budget some of them actually had proposed budgets as an
example less than the actual amount that they were awarded so we're working with them to make sure that they are using all of the funds towards the RFP and
right now the stage that we're at is finalizing the master agreements um which are currently we're working in
collaboration with the mayor's office of contracting services or MOX uh to ensure that those are finalized so we get them
registered as quickly as possible uh and that has just again taken a little bit more time um because of the
challengebased vehicle um this being the first of its kind procurement for human services in New York City uh but that
being said we are really excited to get these off the ground rolling um in early fiscal year 2026 so what's the value of
of the services the monetary volume of all the services that are going to be provided in total it's approximately $14
million uh which again we we plan um for fiscal year 26 and that's about what 3
to four million short of what was cut like a couple years ago um from the programming that was
provided so what is the gap uh what have you eliminated in programming that
addresses that gap while this funding um is not a replacement of the $17 million of the PEG that was applied to the
division of programs budget um it is you know it was 17 million that was the PEG uh so this is 14 million so that's
approximately 3 million of the difference um but we would really like to highlight that the programs that were
offered through the PEG um for the targeted jailbased services contract were insourced with our department's
counseling services no I remember we had a we had lengthy conversations here about that um disagree with the the way
you're describing it but sure it's a decrease um and we've talked about the
decrease in programming and and the value we understand all of the insourcing and why it couldn't be done
effectively and that's why we're back here um so I was just wondering if there was a difference in the type of
programming that accounts for that that gap there well um not that accounts for
the gap but I would say the programming is generally different from the targeted jailbased services contract so it's targeting four core areas supplemental
education which is something that we've never pursued before in such a large contract it's also targeting trauma-informed care substance misuse
programming and transitional planning and transportation um so all of those are new uh or maybe transition planning
is the closest that you could get to what was the targeted jailbased services contract okay um for the April and May
updates provided for the category develop new training for correction officers program staff and healthc care
staff uh states that doc and CHS developed a situational awareness training module in 2020 has this
training been updated since
just a yes or no we don't need a whole description of it just a
Hi thank you for that question deputy Commissioner James Saunders um specifically to that question I'm going
to have to say no but I know that there has been other uh training that has been offered i think crisis intervention
deescalation and CIT training that uh that has been provided but we will have to get back to you about that yeah if
you could send a a write up of what that training is that is um kind of complementing or supplanting that um and
then for PACE units um there was a commitment to double the number of PACE units in DOC by the end
of 2020 how many PACE units are in Rikers today so from 2020 to today I
think in 2020 we had five and as of today we currently have 10 and how are we for staffing do we have adequate
staffing for the PACE units so staffing is a combination of uh uniform staff and
CHS staff so I will have to let CHS staff discuss the clinical side and with
respect to operations I'll let the operations folks discuss that but um
with respect to uniform there was a higher number of uniform staff in that type of setting so Okay okay thank you
um in terms of the formation of a culture change committee of the justice
implementation task force it said it was still in progress as of April what is the status of this
committee i think the um the original imagining of the culture change committee um kind of
um stalled uh with the with COVID and sort of the staffing crisis that emerged afterwards but we are working with
Commissioner McInley Litty and and our partners at the administration as well as Mockj to reimagine what that looks
like um understanding that moving into the new burrow-based jails will require a shift um for both our staff and our
individuals in custody and so we're committed to um finding a way to work together better um in the new facilities
so um before the reimagining it so just there's been no there's been no
committee form there's been no meeting there were prior to my um appointment um
there were the the talks had stalled but we are re reinvigorating that now so no
there's been no committee meeting ever not that I'm aware of okay okay um just a few more
questions regarding ICE on Rikers um we've asked every single time
have there been any further discussions since our last hearing regarding ICE opening or setting up operations on
Riker's Island chair as a council aware we're in current litigation regarding that um so we can't
comment on negotiations but right now there's a stay to that um there's no negotiations happening so just to
confirm there have been no further discussions since our last hearing uh well since the last hearing there was
right because that was before the executive order was signed well that was my question so can you tell us when that
was well that was on the just preceding I forget the exact date when the
executive order was signed i have it somewhere but um preceding that we had conversations with the administration
and then um obviously the executive order was signed and now we're in a litigation posture so who would be
present for that conversation who was present for that conversation present I was involved in conversations and who
else who were the who were the staff members from DOC present in that discussion i think really just myself
and the commissioner but I don't think together there was not present through these please can you confirm that in the
follow-up yeah as long as as well as the date um one more question about the
federal monitor and then I'll pass it back to the chair um Chief District Judge Laura
Taylor Swain has ruled that an independent remediation manager will be appointed to work with the department to
develop a phase action plan to create for reform within the jails as you know we'll have to pay the city's going to
have to pay for the remediation manager have you accounted for that in uh or had a conversation with OM for
that in in upcoming budgets there have been no conversations regarding that obviously you know that's that's also in
what will be active litigation is active litigation so we can't comment on that
okay okay i I'll ask other questions after but turning it back over to chair thank you chair okay we've also been
joined by majority leader Faras and council members Kaban and Abrau and
we're now going to turn to questions council member Lewis followed by Narcissis
thank you chairs and good morning first deputy commissioner and your team um three quick questions um I wanted to
know what is the current gender breakdown of the uniform DOC workforce and how does the department project that
will change in FY26 compared to FY25 um in addition to that a follow-up
question to that is what is the FY26 budget allocation for
um sorry the first one is in regards to the breakdown in gender but the second one is in regards to um how will the the
one-time 50,000 increase and federal funding for the prison rape elimination
program be distributed across services such as education facility audits and uh
survivor support and my last question is in regards to burrow-based jails i wanted to know uh what investments are
being made to ensure that the facility meets the demands for more humane environment including mental health
services family visitation and re-entry programming in alignment with community feedback
board member I may have to ask you during the conversation to repeat your question in order for us to ensure that
we address the first points so I'm going to have um Bureau Chief Chief Rembert
give you the specifics of the breakdown on gender by our staff okay
good morning again uh the gender breakdown for males is
3,026 the female breakdown is 2538 on the male gender breakdown is
54.39% on the female is 45.61% 61%
and how will that change in FY26 you mentioned uniform officers they're eligible for about 716 are eligible for
retirement so how does that look for FY26 so keep in mind that that is very
fluid i wish that we could actually project um who will retire we do have
numbers on who is scheduled but keep in mind that there are some members that
decide to stay with us rather than just go that venue we'll be more than happy
to share with you as we see the attrition rate right but do know um
board member Lewis that as a department we are committed to ensuring that we
recruit and that we on board new staff members significantly new recruits it is
something that we are investing in terms of in-person recruitment by our
recruitment unit as well as investments in market marketing such as
announcements in television radio um using social media to bring in um fresh
members right and um which could be a bit more enticing because I've seen them myself and I'm happy that you all are
investing the funds to do that but it could be more enticing but my last two questions and I'll just try to reiterate
them because my time is up how will the onetime $50,000 increase in federal funding for the prison rape elimination
program be distributed across uh services education facility um and
survivor support and the last one is regarding burrow-based jails the investments to make sure that we have everything we need for a humane
environment assistant Commissioner Zuber will respond to the allocation of the
funds while Commissioner um Assistant Commissioner Maldonado will talk to you about the BBJS thanks thank you Council
Member Lewis uh the the one-time increase in $50,000 will be used to procure services for a trauma expert who
uh and the vendor will um de train one staff member and develop a train the
trainer course it is still preliminary um and we just received the funding so
we haven't done anything yet in terms of procuring or It would be good if you could have conversations with the chair
about this just so that we could make sure whoever this trauma expert is is actually meeting the criteria last one's
on buroughbased jails i know council member wrestler is here he's one of the uh members of the committee i know he'll
have a lot of questions about that but just wanted to ask that really quickly thank you chairs
okay we have questions from council member narcissis followed by wrestler
good morning and thank you chairs um what measures are being taken on this
budget to ensure that incarcerated individuals particularly those with
mental health needs have access to adequate mental health services and care
uh their plans to expand access to mental health professionals and crisis
intervention teams within our correctional facilities and second how does this budget address
the recruitment and retention of correctional officers and what is being
done to ensure that staff receive the necessary training to handle complex
issues like mental health crisis deescalation and trauma informed
care thank you for your question um Council Member Narciz Deputy
Commissioner Saunders will open up with remarks and responses relevant to mental health um crisis and crisis intervention
thank you so and can you make it short for me specifically because I have a few others yes sure so as you know you know
our colleagues at CHS operate you know the the clinical side and they have
different specialized housing areas one mental observation caps and pace so you
have uh mental health needs being addressed through through that vehicle in addition there's training provided at
the academy and ongoing training and crisis intervention and deescalation mental health first aid
training and um and including um CPR and
other types of training
i think I had I'm keeping it brief i had a second part i don't think I hear it the budget uh how does this budget
address the recruitment and retention of correctional officers and what being done to ensure the staff receiving the
or the necessary part you said
thank you so much for that question since Commissioner McGinly Liti's
appointment um as commissioner we have been committed to ensuring the wellness
of our staff when it comes to recruitment and retention that is something that we're focusing on in fact
late last year we developed a retention um team consisting of officers and
supported by the deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners from our training academy those retention
officers are the ones that conduct followups with our newly assigned
officers to ensure that they are well
supported by any of us or by them as they go through the new challenges that
they face in this new position but what we have done in um in addition to that
is the office of mental health has awarded our department with a grant that
we have made great strides in we have indeed onboarded new training to support
our staff members such as resiliency and peer tutoring and peer support it is
crucial that as we do that we also continue to invest in development or the
development of wellness centers throughout our department we are happy
to share with you that earlier this month we opened up four wellness centers
we are in total now have six wellness centers that allowed our staff members
to actually be able to go into those areas to assume or have time to process
anything that has transpired i don't have much time but I want to know how many actually using the wellness i was
going to have some question about wellness i'll be more than happy to do a followup and share with you that
specific and one more thing do you have enough staff to escort um PIC's to
medical appointments because last time we were here we're talking about budget do you have budget and are we do we have
enough production of medical um appointments or PIC's to medical appointments continue to be paramount to
us and so it is prioritized on a daily basis oh since my time is short so I
want to say thank you thank you you've been joined by council member Stevens and now we have questions from council
member Wrestler great thank you very much uh thank you to the chairs and to the department of
corrections for joining us today uh I wanted to first ask about the therapeutic beds so we've had 104 beds
completed at Belleview the work is all done ready waiting mothalled because the Department of Corrections refuses to
staff the facility when will the Department of Corrections be opening this facility date please good morning
sir we don't have a date right now we are still working towards uh state commissioning with the state comm uh commission of correction you're waiting
on SEOC approval we are working with the state to gain approval so that we can commission this as a jail facility so
we've the work has been completed for many months um we've been waiting and waiting years delayed to get this open
uh correctional health services is pointing the finger squarely at you all
why has this not gotten done there has been some I think misunderstanding and miscommunication
about this issue we reached substantial completion resulting in the temporary certificate of occupancy however the
SEOC State Commission of Correction requires final completion in order for individuals in custody to be housed
safely in this facility you know why you haven't gone through that process and secured the necessary approvals for a
facility that's been completed that's years behind schedule mayor Adams has the hoodba to talk about wanting to you
know change the burrowbased jail plan and convert a jail into a mental health facility or into a healthcare facility
we have 104 empty beds that are ready to be open but the Department of Corrections won't do its job you have no
date no timeline none right i mean like you continue to have literally just no
information whatsoever for when the site is going to come online the facility is not yet ready to occupy and is not safe
for individuals in custody and you're not prepared to give any frame of time for when it's going to open as soon as
we have a date we will provide it to you okay years of delay and obstinence and obstruction from the Department of
Corrections and we are still at a point where there is no timeline for when you're moving forward let's shift to the
other two new therapeutic bed facilities that are supposed to also open that the Department of Correction has been wholly
uncooperative in moving forward wood Hull and North Central Bronx when are these sites going to open uh sir the
department has been fully uh cooperative in working with uh CHS and our partners at H&H only people who describe you as
cooperative or yourselves in order in order to review and approve the the
design documents for we're years behind schedule early last year we got the deputy mayor for health and human
services when we had people working over there to approve this project uh Deputy Mayor Williams is gave it got a green
light to move these sites forward again after they had been stalled and we've heard no final design has been approved
we are working to approve those designs sir we are working months and years delay right years and years delay you
could be moving the people out of the Department of Corrections who have the most severe health needs but you're not
doing any of the work to actually make it happen in fact you're obstructing every step of the way and you're saying you're moving forward and you're working
cooperatively with no timelines no accountability and no actual milestones
to demonstrate progress i think my staff who work tirelessly on both the burrowbased jail program and the OTHU
program would argue that they are dedicated to this program and to the OTHU program if you don't come before us
with a timeline for when you're going to actually get anything accomplished then there's no accountability sir we can't
we can't account for the SEOC and the timeline that it takes we are working towards those milestones any other
agency that comes before us with capital funding for a project has been in the budget for five years this capital
funding would say these are the dates and the times that we're going to have design completed we're going to have procurement completed we're going to
have construction completed the Department of Correction though just operates in fair in fantasy land and just does whatever it wants whenever it
wants and I don't understand it i like don't understand why you should all have the ability to come before us and give
no information no timeline no accountability it's not how this is supposed to work our job is to ask
questions and get answers and yet every time you come before us we get nothing so I I this was just one topic i could
have done 10 topics but the answers would have all been the same no information no substance no accountability that is the hallmark for
the Department of Corrections under Eric Adams
thank you Council Member uh I have one or two questions i'm going to turn it back to Chair Nurse uh in the
preliminary plan um DOC received a almost a $4.5 million increase for
nutritional services yet at the border of corrections meeting on uh May 13 of
this year there were multiple complaints about the food including allegations that there were not enough food for
everyone and that people were not receiving food per their dietary or religious uh restrictions so what's
being done to address those complaints
thank you for the question turn your mic hi Deputy Commissioner James Saunders thank you for the question so I can tell
you that we have approximately 7,500 PIC persons in in custody as of today the
nutritional services division prepares over 20,000 meals daily within that
number are a number of specialized meals for individuals who declare themselves
to be of a certain religion and we have plenty of specialized meals for
individuals who request a uh a kosher meal um we also have specialized meals
for individuals who have a therapeutic need so if there's a specific complaint
I'd be happy to take it back to the team and address it i mean I'm I I guess we're talking about in this meeting on
May 13th there were multiple complaints made at the border correction meeting including allegations that there was not
enough food and that people who have dietary or religious
uh restrictions were not getting that food you're not aware of that so Chair
Brandon any complaint that is brought to our attention is immediately addressed by the area that is supposed to be
responsible for nutritional services would have been addressed by Deputy
Commissioner Saunders and his entire team okay but he just said he's not aware of
the complaint we're not brought to us directly brought
to us directly with a name of a person that complains in order for us to just
not look at the complaint of the person but how that complaint has impacted an
entire area is something that we would have addressed okay back in March um DOC
said they were looking to hire an assistant commissioner to oversee nutritional services has that position
been filled the interview process has been conducted and the name of the candidate has been
um submitted for vetting okay um do you have enough staff to escort
all the people in custody to medical appointments
so there's no magic number to to give you right now to say that there is you
know we need 300 individuals to escort i can tell you that out of the 640 or so
thousand scheduled appointments for an average daily population of 6,900 there are enough staff the vast majority of of
nonp production is due to individuals not wanting to go to their clinic
appointment um and less than 1% of clinic non-production relates to there
not having an escort available and in the case where there is no escort
available we work very closely with CHS to have the individual rescheduled for
later in the day or for the following day
all right I'm going to turn it back to chair nurse thanks thanks i just wanted to follow up on the
therapeutic units sorry to bring you back up
um can you tell me about the the nature of working with the state commission like when was the last time you all had
a meeting together or you wait like what's outstanding just so that we have a little bit more sense
of what you're dealing with sure um they uh visit the site at Belleview at least
once a month and I believe our last walkthrough was approximately two weeks ago um and uh following those meetings
and we meet we discuss the transition and they also walk the site following those meetings they send a letter to our
commissioner uh detailing the the the expectations that they would need to meet commissioning and sort of the
progress therein um so there are some some significant construction items that are still outstanding um that our team
DC Dohy and his team will have to uh complete um there are also Can you talk
can you elaborate just a little bit more on some of those on the construction items sure just to understand how
significant they are some of the um design uh fixtures uh that were in place
are behavioral health fixtures and so we are remedying those to be uh correctional grade um fixtures because
this is a detention grade facility and under the state commission those are required what kind of fixtures are just
exit signs okay um staff stations there's glazing on the staff stations okay for example um there's also some
trim that's utilized that's metal trim for example um that we wouldn't put in a in a detention facility so those things
are being remedied by our team um we also have uh policies that we've submitted to the SEOC for review and
approval um we received feedback recently so we're in in a sort of a an editing process with them uh we also
have training our training academy is working with our team and CHS as well in order to develop training
multidisciplinary training for everybody who will be assigned to this facility so that's ongoing the SEOC will have to
approve those um but the biggest obstacle in true transparency is our staffing issue um as has been described
here today staffing uh is a problem uh for for the department currently and um
this is a staffing rich model um the efficiencies are not maximized in this particular facility so we are working
again with the state to identify which posts are mandatory in order to provide a safe and secure environment for both
sta staff and people in custody okay so it one it would be great to get that out if you could provide in the follow-up
that outstanding list i think that would help um members understand why you know what's going on so we don't assume
nothing's going on and then two um in terms of staffing you so you've
submitted a staffing plan and the state has rejected it or you haven't developed a sting a staffing plan and you're in
process with that can you just I mean how many people are you needing my understanding is CHS will be managing
the the staffing um and budget for that am I corre correct in that um I'm not
sure they will certainly be handling their own uh staffing and and their assignments uh for the medical services
and mental health services however the department will oversee the depart uh the facility as a whole and will manage
its own staffing um in terms of budget those staff members come out of our lines of of budget um we do we did have
a we submitted a draft staffing plan to the state commission of correction um it was approximately 280 staff members when
was that when did you submit that was it in this year it was this Okay forgive me i don't remember the dates but at our
last I believe at our last couple hearings we discussed that it was about approximately 280 staff members needed
that's including staff members for all three tours all of the posts as well as um coverage factors right for people who
are out or what have you um and so those that was 200 approximately 280 needed to
be assigned um the state came back uh with its post analysis and they
described 99 posts that would be needed um to to manage this facility however
that does not take into account local regulations as well as that does not take into account some of our collective
bargaining agreements so we are currently in the process of working with the state to figure out what that number really is when you take into account all
of these other factors the state says you need 99 cos posts posts I'm sorry
and then you're accounting for you know the tours and backup in case people call
do all of that other work um so it's still over approximately over 200 and those pieces are part of collective
bargaining or are those separate pieces some of those pieces are part of collective bargaining um that require a
certain number of posts for depending on what the um the uniform rank is so again we're kind of working through those
details and certainly welcome an opportunity to talk offline when do you when do you anticipate sending something
back to the state in short order within like a couple months oh certainly
within a couple of months i mean we're in regular communication with them and this staffing plan would be required for
commissioning and when's their next uh visit or when's your next scheduled meeting with them i believe it's next
month um they come down for for both the Belleview project as well as the Burbase jail project okay
[Music] um ask question oh uh Council Member Althia do you want to ask a question
hello good morning i just have a question um I I have a a colleague and and friend
who's has a sibling who's in jail and they have an issue around we need to
know how many lockdowns and nonmovements that's happening in the JRVC building
because um they got word that they have been locked down for a number of days and just trying to see how often these
lockdowns are taking place um what are the cause of some of these lockdowns um because we have some serious concerns
And this was like apparently like a week or two ago to give you a general overview on
lockdowns I'll have senior deputy commissioner Fra
good morning man sc FRA in reference to the lockdowns of GRVC or any other facility on um on Riker's Island those
are generally based on acts of violence or uh the locks on appointments that
occur in those facilities so as for instance this weekend there were three acts of violence in one facility which
means we'd have to lock the facility down to make sure all the PE persons in custody are safe and before we open back
up to search for possible weapons and things of that nature uh this week so do you have like an average on how how
often these lockdowns are taking place i don't have an average in front of me right now but I can provide that to you
uh after this meeting in your future and so um like so obviously how long does
the the lockdown typically take place cuz what I'm hearing it was for a couple weeks and um we she doesn't know the
building that the unit he's in she just knows it's JRVC the building and she
doesn't know what um house he's in there is no couple weeks of lockdown
it's a day several days depending on the circumstance and how many happen in that facility and the time it takes for us to
have enough staff to search and to make sure that it's render how of how long does it typically take your staff to
search if there is an active violence or something like that if there's only one active violence usually they activate uh
some of the units to go up there instantaneous when it happens if it's overnight they're locked down until we can get the personnel sometimes the
facilities we we ask security staff to start doing the searches on their own but it varies i can't give you specifics
on the exact timing on how long each takes but it's based on the severity of the circumstances and the situation and
it's a fluid situation if we have a situation where there's you know 10 or so people in in reference to violence
and three or four going to the hospital that puts a strain on us to manage the facility also so those are all the
considerations that take place i can give you more information at a later date exactly how many we've had the past
month and where where we rectified them oh yeah definitely um if you could follow up offline and definitely give me
um how many has taken place in the last month how long and the the length that they were um and I'll also try to get
the exact house that we had got these reports from that they were on lockdown for a number of of weeks um and just try
to get an understanding of what's happening thank you receive
m I said I can give you some information on for instance November 2024 EMTC had
32 all the way to May of 2025 so for the month of uh from November 2024 to May of
25 EMTC had 32 lockin situations grvc uh
the facility from the month of November 2024 to May 2025 they had 75 so all of
that day so you're specifically in resident GRVC so those are the numbers for the GRVC i'm sorry say that again
i'm sorry those are the numbers for GRBC it's 75 they had 75 lockdowns between November and and till May until May i
can't tell you the length but those are the exact numbers for those instances okay and just in general council members
uh the last go-to really is to lock down a house it really does depend on a situation we have tried to strive not to
lock down an entire facility and prefer if there's a specific concentrated situation in the housing area to just
open up the entire facility and just keep that specific housing area on lockdown so it really is a case-byase
basis but yes if you can certainly get us the housing area that would be super helpful for us to give you that feedback
no no listen I understand that there there's a line and we have to make sure that we're keeping everyone safe but
from what we were hearing that they there was a number of weeks where they were locked down and and folks couldn't get in touch with them and it was
causing a lot of issues and so I'll definitely follow up um offline to get you the exact house cuz I think she's
working on that now but um 75 is a lot and so thinking about what are we doing to mitigate the violence so that we can
have less violent outbreaks and things like that and so I think all of those things um need to be considered because
if there was 75 between November and May um is locking down is that working cuz
you know for me it's always thinking about are there other solutions and what are other ways for us to think about but
um I will get that information i'll follow up thank you Councilwoman Stevens um the lockins uh there's a process so
you could do a 1-hour lock in if there you suspect an incident that's going to occur then we have a housing area lock
in a facility lock in and also we could have uh a partial lock in where two of
the persons in custody must locked in for their own safety concern so we could bring them out so when we talk about
lock in emergency lock in there's there's a there there are steps and levels to it it's not just we lock it in
it depends on what it is now when um SEC uh FRAJ spoke about 75 for GRBC we have
to determine was a housing area locked in was it a departmental lock in was it
a uh facility lock in or was a h a partial lock in and was it just an hour
lock in with the assistant deputy water can lock in they were saying specifically it was a lockdown and
nonmovement and this was going on for several weeks so um that that's the bulk of the information I had so I know
obviously they're going to be different circumstances and things like that and so um I just you know like I said it's
more asking like what's the process and obviously it's different circumstances different levels yes ma'am different
levels different stages so you definitely give us that information we check and get back with you yeah and also again like just thinking about like
what are if and I know the tools are limited um I don't want to pretend like we don't have limited tools but thinking
about is are there other things that we could be doing too so but I'll I will follow up with you guys offline just to
get you some more information um because we were trying to come to facility but our schedule's in the line but there was
there was quite some um there was some concerns because she we couldn't get in touch with her
brother for quite some time so thank you yes ma'am
okay um thank you council member i wanted to touch on the um Cisco virtual
visitation platform um wanted to know will this platform be available on the personal tablets
uh something we can certainly explore we're still working with the vendor and we're currently in the procurement
process but we do know that Cisco application would help kind of streamline the current virtual visit
platform and kind of reduce our reliance on Microsoft Teams for both family visits virtual visits as well as
attorney virtual visits um if not on personal tablets how are you all envisioning this the setup to be first
tapping into our existing um kind of apparatuses and platforms throughout the facilities and then kind of exploring if
we need to either expand it in other places so people can have access we'll obviously have a conversation about
tablets as well as scheduling uh a scheduling platform for scheduling inerson visits which I think recently
passed okay um and the Lightning Law Discovery Sharing
Platform can you uh just for the record I don't think we've talked about it here at this hearing uh or in this committee
for um before maybe we did i'm sorry but can you just for the record explain how
the platform will work we're going to have our deputy um
general counsel yeah i so I'm I'm not incredibly versed on the technical
aspects of it but essentially what it does it allows an attorney to share all
types of discovery directly with the client so it it would encompass records
i believe video is part of that as well so anybody want camera type things it's something that is direct from the
attorney to the client they could review the discovery um I I think there's an element of a communication the kind of a
messaging back and forth but um we we envision it and and as do the defense bar to be something that really helps to
facilitate um an advanced review of the discovery before they meet with them
because what ends up happening is if you have to do it all at one time it becomes protracted visits and I think they want
to accelerate this so that when they have the appearances it's kind of taken care of before the court appearances and
so this will be kind of set up similar to the the uh visitation area no
actually I think this is going to be on the tablets oh this is on the table yes the lightning law will be on the tablets and um kiosks in the law library the um
the virtual visits is going to be for now in kiosks got
it okay um in terms of the uh opioid opioid stimulant and substance program
um you we've got money for hiring five addiction counselors to provide persons in custody with individual plans
counseling connection to community based organizations when do you all anticipate filling these positions
hello Mccertie again uh so we have interviewed for the five um positions we
have actually submitted for them as well so we are considering them in the pipeline we're waiting for them to uh
get their final vetting to be able to onboard them okay great we are also posting for a supervisor um so that
should be going up shortly okay and we see that the funding stops after fiscal year uh 27 um is there any reason for
that that you're aware of that was the length of the grant um so this is a grant-f funed uh position and so the
length of the grant is is for those few years and we we hope to be able to bring those folks on um full-time with our own
lines okay uh I wanted to ask a question well while you're up here we have um
just one more programming question um you had 34 vacancies in the division of
programming um which credited for the lack of staff to your inability to meet the mandatory
5 hours how many of those positions have been filled and how many are still vacant i think you answered this earlier
but just Yeah so when we last um spoke and we came up with uh or we spoke about
that number we reduced that number down to 12 vacancies um with the addition of a few actually new needs that came in we
currently have 20 vacancies but those weren't accounted for when we were speaking at the preliminary budget hearing so I just want to flag that and
those actually include like the five lines for the substance misuse counselors that we're trying to to bring
in in the pipeline um so right now it's 20 uh that we have as true you know
vacancies okay um transitioning to cell
doors uh the preliminary plan included a baseline 2.5 million increase for cell
doors um just a question on how many doors have been replaced so far using these funds
morning thank you for the question uh Kevin Dhy deputy commissioner facility maintenance repair
division for fiscal year 25 are you speaking for the 2.5 allocated for
fiscal year 25 or let me see how it's written here is not
it's not Yeah look it just says um how how much did you spend in FY25 on doors
actually let me start there so for fiscal year 25 not accounting for
the 2.5 that was allocated in as of March yes we have installed 177 doors
okay do you provide do you purchase doors from the same provider
every time we we allocate we go through our jocks
contractor and we provide spec very specific uh requirements for the doors
uh for the doors that we have allocated currently they are they do come from uh
one specific vendor one specific vendor right there's like I'm sure there's not like that many jail door builders out
there correct okay so um
uh the funding specifically to purchase new doors um that's put in the plan is
that to cover the cost for new parts or whole new doors or does it also cover
personnel costs associated with that so for the for the $2.5 million that was
baselined from fiscal year 25 till 29 that is for the full and complete
installation of doors so that comes with door frame door itself locking
mechanisms door hinges removal cost installation cost as well as manpower
cost and is the uh who does the labor for that contractor outside okay
is it generally the same contractor every time so for the 177 doors prior to
the 2.5 allocated this year that was done by in-house trades okay uh and
we specifically did it in areas of the
higher classification okay so previously doors were done by
in-house trades moving forward it will be outsourced through contractors
correct okay
okay uh I'm going to ch transition to a conversation about the state prison
facilities um well the clos the closure of three additional state prison
facilities um and wondering what have been the nature of the conversations between you
all and state corrections on how to get folks who are sentenced and waiting to
to move upstate off of Rikers so thank you very much for that question our
conversations with the state are ongoing our commissioner continues to have those
conversations on a weekly basis our custody management unit also has those
conversations on a daily basis the challenge for the state right now is
that as it opened its intake it's not just taking persons from our our own
jurisdiction but rather the entire state and so the conversations are ongoing
it's not a secret that we are and have been managing a bed capacity um
challenge our staff and our members of very specific divisions and you and
units have really done an incredible job in basically ensuring that we have all
the necessary cells all the necessary housing areas that we have a bed for
every person that remains in our care as well as those that are coming in but the
conversations chair are ongoing ongoing I imagine has the state provided a date in which any date or any timeline in
which they'll resume upstate transfers so they have already opened up as of May 5th the numbers that they're taking for
us are not ideal because they need to basically take from every county i think
that we they have taken so far um approximately 87 persons that are state
ready but the number and the challenge that we have is that those who are
deemed state ready right now are a large number for us what's the number
it exceeds 900 as of today is 900 um 12 state ready
okay okay um for people who are nearing
uh their parole eligibility date have you discussed the possibility of facilitating parole board hearings at
Rikers i I've had conversations with with Docs
and um their council um well not directly with their council assistant commissioners about that i I mean I
think we really have to look at exactly what you're talking about and I've mentioned this you know because as we go along people are credited with the time
that they were in our custody to begin with so I think there's a circumstance where they're approaching a lot of those
um you know those end of sentence or parole eligible type dates uh they've
committed to do that again unfortunately because of of what the first deputy commissioner said that they're doing it
statewide you know they haven't been able to dedicate anyone to us directly yet but but that's our hope because I
think it's it's a really important thing that they need to look at okay uh just a couple more
questions uh and actually General Counsel I'll stick with you um with
regards to the DOI uh deadlocking investigation are there any updates that you can share no that's ongoing and as a
matter of fact we just had a communication with them this morning um where we're facilitating some uh transfer of discovery for them okay
there we I believe we heard that there was a internal memo that was distributed to staff about uh about deadlocking to
discourage this practice that That's correct that happened that's right it was back when this first was raised at
the board of correction meeting we did circulate it at that time is it possible for you to share that with the council sure yeah we can follow up with that
yeah okay um and one other question similarly um
under the investigation investigations uh around uh Charisma Jones um they
found that she was repeatedly denied medical care even after being transferred to the infirmary with staff
claiming that she was on medlock um and officers stopped medical staff from entering her cell multiple times to
check her vitals as you know she was later rushed to the hospital pronounced dead from mult multiorgan failure um can
you clarify uh what being on medlock means and under what conditions someone
would be put on medlock so so medlock is um it's not something that we find in in
our operational directives it's more something that's colloquial term it's um
medical um lock in so in that facility particular Rose M Singer um there is no
communicable disease unit so that is what would be used at that time uh it's
just something where there is a a condition where they can't be otherwise in the dorm areas or um you know in
other facilities that they're they're sent there um it's also sometimes used in circumstances when uh a person newly
in intake has not been medically cleared so where they won't consent to search procedures or otherwise so that's that's
what that area is specifically so who makes those determinations in a in a
facility um it's it's done by in certain circumstances CHS would make that
determination and others it's again on the security front when they've not been cleared i think it's done by our intake
um and that's communicated outward to uh wardens on the floor your deputy wardens
on the floor like how does that trickle down for someone to know that this this uh young woman was on the colloially
termed medlock i think it specifically has to yes I think it has to go to the the facility leadership though again I I
don't know the exact processes and and the dissemination of information but the wardens in those facilities would know who's supposed to be assigned to those
areas would you mind providing the protocol for that so we can understand how that is determined under what
conditions and how that gets commun how it's supposed to be communicated out yeah as I mentioned that's that's a colloquial term that's kind of used for
that i know that but if someone is being put aside for some kind of quarantine or
something or u medical staff are being denied to go check up on someone there
must be a there i imagine there's a protocol with that and if not that's we have a serious problem so if there is
one we'd like to have it we certainly will thank you
i believe those are all Oh oh final question um how many people have been released
via 6A year to date in 2025
hello uh so for 6A year to date is 34 people so this is January to date 34 as
in 34 34 okay 34 people and how many people are working reviewing and working
on those types of cases yes thank you for that question uh so we have an assistant commissioner assigned to our
reintegration unit uh underneath that assistant commissioner is an executive director of reintegration as well as a
director of reintegration uh last year for example at this time we had one person part-time reviewing individuals
for 6A at this time we have three people uh reviewing individuals or um
candidates for 6A three people so three people assigned to just review cases is that what they
do fully it they have other responsibilities but this is part of their responsibility so three people
okay okay those are our question my questions i'll turn it back over to
Chair Brandon okay thank you all very much for your testimony and we look forward to working with you going
forward thank you thank you thank you we're going to take a I'm sorry um Coun
chairs um this is Council Member Kat i'm so sorry i I just I passed along a couple of questions to the chairs i
don't know if it's possible to ask them on my own oh we just Yeah we just got Yep yep yep we just got them now we'll
ask sorry I just got Thank you we don't We don't have quarums so Council Member Kaban can't ask her questions but we're
going to ask them for her um it's related to the 6A program actually um in March you testified that
498 people serving city sentences were eligible for early release through the 6A program in this month's board of
correction meeting your staff called the current situation in the jails with the sharp rise in the jail population
unprecedented and board members urge you to respond to this crisis by using 6A as widely as the department did in March
2020 when over 300 people were released in one month have you considered applying the same criteria that was
applied in March 2020 to uh expand 6A releases no um chair nurse if I may
clarify the number that was quoted earlier is the number of sentenced
individuals that were assigned to our custody only sentenced individuals can
be considered for 6A when we talk about 6A we talk about doing an internal
analysis of the entire history of that sentenced individual that could be
potentially considered there are very specific criteria of um charges that
will not allow that person to be considered for 6A um but just because we
have x amount of sentenced doesn't mean that all of those sentences individuals
can be released into 6A and so the team member that deputy commissioner McCarti
has described to you it is their responsibility to actually look at every
single sentence individual to determine if they are eligible for the 6A program
what's the what's the a I mean well what you've testified is that you don't actually have full-time like a full-time
staffer just dedicated to reviewing cases you have three people who have other responsibilities but also work on
this so I think that's an issue given the potential eligibility of 498 people
um and I guess I'm wondering um what's the average length that a review process
is that's a great question so um and just to also highlight we are looking at
making a full-time staff person um that literally this is their sole responsibility but right now we've just
divided it between three people um but the average length really varies and so based on what um the initial review
might take for one person you know a day or a few days um for that initial let's
check on their charges let's see if they have um you know any open cases things
that might be easier to stream through um but then it can take up to two weeks for us to go and review their full
folder uh which is paperbased like reviewing of any additional forms anything that could be literally a
judge's order for them not to be considered um for early release or rather not even early release um for a
program such as 6A and what would you say the percentage of time per each of those three staff people is spent on
case review i mean I can verify for one of them it's it's multiple hours of their day okay so
I I think the the point um a point the council member would like
to make if she was able to speak for herself um in March 2020
um there was about 300 people released only nine were rearrested for any charge
less than 1% which is only two people were rearrested for a violent felony um
and so this is clearly a a program and a pathway that would work and it I think
it would be really great to get that full staff member on um in any other capacity that would be needed given the the situation with upstate inability to
transfer the mental health blockage upstate as well and then what we have um
the over you know the census population growing so council member just to add we happy we're happy to look into possibly
expanding what the team looks like that review these 6A applications but also just to put it on the record like March
2020 looks very different than May 2025 and so did our population so to the FDC's point the people who are sentenced
now the makeup of their offenses look very different than the people who were in our in our population in March of
2020 and just to underscore like March 2020 that was COVID right so people were released and most of them probably
sheltered in place right and these were people who had lower offenses but we are definitely and we've had conversation
and committed to looking into possibly figuring out how we can expand the unit to create a more systematic review of
those applications but I know it's something that has definitely been a priority for the FDC and DC Marty as well as the commissioner yeah it would
be great if you could provide that statistical data to back up what you're saying in terms of what the top charge
of folks were that were released because what we're seeing is you know only two people rearrested and it's not even
clear if there was a conviction on any val uh violent top charge okay that was it thank you great
thank you all very much all right so we're going to take a break we will reconvene at around noon and
we'll hear from the mayor's office of immigrant affairs

We're ready to begin thank you Sergeant good afternoon
and welcome to second portion of today's executive budget hearings we're going to hear uh today this afternoon from the um
Commissioner Castro and the mayor's office of immigrant affairs i'm Council Member Brandon i chair the committee on
finance and I'm pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague Council Member Alexis Avilis who chairs the committee
on immigration we've been joined this afternoon by Council Member Salam Lewis Hanife and Moya uh welcome Commissioner
Castro and your team thank you for joining us today to answer our questions on May 1st 2025 the administration
released the executive financial plan for FY26 to 29 with her proposed FY26
budget of $115.1 billion moya's projected FY26
budget of 781,962 represents less than 1% of the
administration's uh proposed budget in the executive plan and it remains unchanged from the amount budgeted for
Moya in the administration's preliminary plan back in January
my questions today will largely focus on Moya's priorities as well as capacity legal support services and language
access for various city agencies but I now want to turn to my co-chair for this hearing council member Ailles for her
her opening statement thank you so much chair um good good
afternoon i'm council member Alexa chair of the committee on immigration thank you all for joining us at this fiscal
2026 executive budget hearing for the mayor's office of immigrant affairs otherwise known as Moya i would like to
thank my fellow council member Chair Brandon for joining me at this joint hearing and also would like to thank
Commissioner Castro and other members of the administration who are with us today uh I want to take a moment to
acknowledge uh the precious and ongoing contributions that immigrant New Yorkers make to our city every single day
culturally and economically immigrants are the heartbeat of our neighborhoods and a vital part of the fabric of not
only New York City but the country as a whole and yet daily we've seen our federal government threaten the safety
and vitality of our immigrant New Yorkers just this weekend a high school student in the Bronx was detained after
showing up to what he thought was a routine uh court date and ever since has
been prevented from see receiving desperate medical care or service from
his legal counsel stories like this will only become more common in our city
under this Trump administration particularly if we are not funding the organizations that provide the direct
services and/or education to immigrant communities i would also like to recognize that the
work the city has undertaken to support immigrants health particularly in expanding access to care through
initiatives like New York City care and providing emergency health services along with disease prevention uh
prevention care to those who most cannot who cannot afford it regardless of their
immigration status these are critical steps to ensure that our new neighbors
remain healthy and we commend the city agencies and community partners working tirelessly to meet the needs of our
diverse communities our city government is the last line of defense in providing
crucial services to our most vulnerable communities that being said we must also
be honest about the gaps that remain and how the proposed fiscal 2026 executive
budget misses the mark of further supporting the enormous work that
community-based organizations are doing on the ground prioritizing and adequately funding legal services again
adequately funding legal services and language access should not be negotiable
these are essential components to a just and equitable city and when these supports fall short it impacts the lives
and livelihoods leaving our new neighbors and old neighbors vulnerable
at every moment they need for stability and protection further compounding this
challenge is the federal house approved budget reconciliation bill which proposes new penalties for states that
offer healthcare to undocumented immigrants this is deeply troubling development that threatens New York's
ability to continue using state funds to support essential care it risks widening
existing disparities and could undermine our longstanding commitment to being a
city that welcomes and cares for all we cannot claim to be a sanctuary city while simultaneously scaling back the
very support that makes that vision real this administration has had both the
time and the resources to build a comprehensive and compassionate response unfortunately we've seen much of
reactive decisions underinvestment and and very much missed opportunities new
York City has long been a safe haven for immigrant communities including the growing number of unaccompanied minors
who arrive here seeking safety and stability this young population faces
tremendous challenges navigating immigration court alone and the executive budget lacks any dedicated
funding to address the ad to address this unique need cancelled contracts
also has meant loss of hundreds of jobs in New York City as well this
administration and the council has a responsibility to ensure that our city budget reflects our values and
acknowledges the truth of this time and yet throughout the budget exercise we
see the administration acting like nothing is quite happening in the broader context and it would much rather
waste taxpayer dollars in advancing Trump's agenda than harnessing everything in our city's power to
protect immigrants it is unconscionable highly alarming and profoundly harmful
to immigrant communities before we hear from Moy I would like to thank committee staff Karolina Gil Florentine Kabore
Nicole Kata Rebecca Barila as well as my dedicated staff Edward Cerna and
Christina Bautego for their unwaving commitment and hard work with that thank
you chair thank you chair going to turn it over to the committee council Brian Saro to swear you in and we can begin
good afternoon do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this committee and to
respond honestly to council member questions commissioner Commissioner Castro Deputy Commissioner Sanchez
I do deputy Commissioner Lucero I do you may begin thank you Chair Az and Chair
Brennan and the Committee on Immigration and the Committee on Finance for holding this budget hearing my name is Manuel
Castro and I serve as the commissioner of the mayor's office of immigrant affairs i'm joined today by Jasnia
Sanchez deputy commissioner of administration and strategic initiatives and Lorena Lucero deputy commissioner of
programs and policy in my testimony I will discuss fiscal year 2026
uh budget and our priorities but before I begin I want to speak directly to New
York City's immigrant communities

health hospitals
quentones
now in English I know this is a difficult time i know many are feeling
fear fear of being separated from their loved ones fear of having to leave their
place the place that they have now call their home or even fear simply being
seen i felt that fear i crossed the border when I was just 5 years old and
grew up undocumented in this very city i know that it what it's like to try to build a life while carrying uncertainty
every single day so I want to take this moment to say this to you clearly and directly our immigrant communities as
you've heard from the mayor and from our city's leadership keep accessing all city services without fear as you've
heard directly from the school's chancellor continue to send your children to school from the police
commissioner if you witness or experience a crime call 911 from the
president of our health and hospital system and the commissioner of the department of health and mental hygiene
seek care at our public hospitals and city administered health programs when
you need them and I can go on and on because this city has people public servants educators healthcare workers
your neighbors who care deeply about your safety and your future these are
not only city services they are your rights and they are here for you but
most importantly don't lose faith don't lose hope continue to live your life and
don't let fear win now let me begin with a brief overview of where we stand i'm
glad to share that all of Moya's funding is preserved in the executive budget for fiscal year 2026 and we are entering the
new fiscal year with a proposed budget of approximately 29.6 million the
largest budget since the office was created this budget allows to continue strengthening MOYA's programs and
infrastructure across key pillars immigration legal and support services English language learning language
access community engagement and communications to our immigrant communities we will build on three and a
half years of sustained missiondriven work during which Moya has delivered more services than at any other time in
the office history while responding to multiple crisis impacting immigrant communities during this time we've
significantly expanded access to immigration legal and support services English classes language support and
more we've also managed a record number of contracts with immigrants serving
nonprofits ensuring our efforts remain deeply rooted in the community moya aims
to use its funding in the most strategic way to meet the emerging needs of immigrant communities on immigration
legal services in fiscal year 26 we are working to a establish our new MOYA
immigration legal support centers and b extend contracts to existing legal
providers we are on track to launching the Moya immigration legal support
centers initiative for fiscal year 26 by July 1st this initiative is a 6.4 4
million annually funded program that will support 25 immigrant serving
nonprofit contractors contractors to provide culturally and linguistic responsive immigration legal services in
immigrant dense neighborhoods in addition we are extending existing contracts with immigration legal service
providers through fiscal year 26 and incorporating them into our MOYA centers
model this new model represents an evolution of ActionNYC and past
approaches it incorporates changes that meet the current and emerging needs of
New York City's immigrant communities and places services directly in immigrant neighborhoods we will also
continue to operate the Moya immigration legal hotline in partnership with Catholic Charities in 2024 alone the
hotline received over 64,000 calls connecting immigrant New Yorkers to
consultations and trusted referrals amongst our providers another cornerstone of our work is English
language instruction our MOYA English learning program run in partnership with
New York City's three public library systems currently offers English classes at nearly 60 branches and community
centers across the city during my tenure we developed a comprehensive beginner level curriculum that had been widely
requested by both advocates and learners and was missing from the curriculum now
the curriculum is available at all levels of proficiency not only and it not only teaches English but connects
immigrants to city resources and services helping our communities navigate life in New York City with
greater confidence and independence as with previous years language access remains a key priority for Moya over the
last several years we've worked hard to build an in-house team of experts that now provide translation and
interpretation services for mayoral offices and technical assistance to over 45 city agencies helping them comply
with local authority and meaningful meaningfully expand language access across city government in April we
launched the I Speak campaign as part of our immigrant heritage week encouraging all New Yorkers to request services in
the language they're most comfortable with and reminding agencies of their obligations to provide it community
engagement remains at the heart of our work as we seek to be an office deeply rooted in community in 2025 alone Moya's
external affairs and outreach team has made more than 10,000 direct touch points with immigrant New Yorkers
through resource fairs tablely know your rights presentations days of action canvasing and through our Axmoya email
and hotline we also launched the New York rights for immigrant New Yorkers campaign across more than 4,000 digital
screens across New York City ensuring that accurate multi multilingual information is reached by communities
citywide in a time of uncertainty uncertainty and misinformation Moya's communications efforts help ensure
immigrant New Yorkers received information from trusted messengers in their own language for example in recent
months we partnered with the department of health and mental hygiene for multilingual media roundt on healthc
care access and and collaborated with the department of housing preservation and development the communi commission
on human rights and the mayor's public engagement union for a press briefing on housing rights these events drew over 46
ethnic and community media outlets with coverage in Chinese Udu Korean Arabic
Spanish Bangla and more combined these stories received over 1 million impressions directly reaching immigrant
audiences with timely and accurate information lastly I want to thank the
many public servants across city agencies and offices who continue to show up for immigrant New Yorkers and to
our team at the mayor's office of immigrant affairs for their commitment and for continuing to show up for all
immigrant communities i am proud of what we've accomplished together and I remain committed to ensuring New York City
remains a national model for immigrant services and opportunity thank you again
for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your questions thank you Commissioner also been joined by Council
Member Dear Rosa um a couple of questions for me and then I want to really turn it over to the chair um
during the preliminary budget hearing uh you stated that the immigrant rights collaborative was planning an additional
know your rights uh workshops in schools and and was had a goal of completing 240
workshops could you tell us if if we've met that goal or or uh how we're looking
yes um we have not met that goal but we are on our way um we currently have
about 80 trainings left okay and could you give us an idea of how the the burrow equity shakes out
there how many are happening in each burrow are you trying to do an equal amount in each burrow um so I don't have
the burough breakdown but I can tell you that um the way that it was designed it was to prioritize uh folks who were in
shelter schools um and faith-based institutions and I do have the breakdown
there if you want that uh yeah that'd be great so in shelters um uh we've done
about 52 trainings so far in schools we've done 47
um and then um 14 have been at faith-based institutions
and has the the cruelty and chaos coming from Washington impacted attendance at
these workshops better or worse or
I think there's been several things that have impacted attendance um but I I can
say that there has been um when we first started the workshops there were more people coming um because of that we had
to pivot um so instead of doing in person we had to move to doing them online to meet uh the low decline in
numbers so there's no additional funding added in FY26 for the immigrant rights
collaborative do we assume that the program will be discontinued beyond FY25
um if I can add um thank you for the question um so the immigrant right uh
collaborative was uh an emergency um uh push uh as part of our office to
increase the number of uh know your rights uh workshops uh so that was uh something that we did for uh for the
second half of uh FY25 in FY26 the immigrant drives workshops program
itself continues and is fully funded u so we will continue to fund uh the 17 uh
community based organizations that have been contracted yearly uh to continue that work did you ask the administration
for more funding considering everything that's going on right now uh we have been in close communications with uh
with our partners at OMB to assess uh the the needs of our programs
okay uh during the preliminary budget hearings you stated that Moya uh were developing an intranet for all city
agencies to better access Moya's resources could you give us the status update of that and and when do you
anticipate it might go live yes we're working uh with our multiple
city agency partners uh to develop this intra uh internet and we'll be launching
uh very soon um we're hoping to be launched uh by the next fiscal year what's the budget for the project uh we
are using existing funds for uh this project you're they're making you use your own MOYA funding they're not the
funding is not housed in a different uh agency uh no we're working closely with uh our partners at our OTI to develop
this website existing using existing funds
and h how does Moya utilize ethnic media to keep New York and in general and immigrants uh in particular informed
yes we hold um um ethnic and immigrant meeting roundts on a regular basis we
aim to have at least one per month uh if not per quarter uh as I mentioned in my
testimony we held recently two very successful immigrant media ethnic
roundts one to highlight access to health care and another to uh highlight
immigrant rights and housing uh this is incredibly important work that we prioritize uh because we know that uh
over a third of uh New Yorkers access uh media or news through their language
community uh outlets the We Speak NYC um
and the MOYA English learning and support centers i see the executive plan includes um just about
$620,000 but that's compared to 1.1 million last year why was the budget for
we speaken NYC reduced um so for next fiscal year in FOY 26 um
we have uh secured in the executive plan about 600K as you mentioned we continue
to be in close collaboration uh in communication with uh OM uh to uh
continue to assess uh the needs uh and um and funding uh that is uh that will
be needed for but why was it reduced so much um again um the fiscal in fiscal 25
we were um happy to receive that additional funding from our partners at OM and we continue those conversations
with them uh as we get closer to the adopted plan i just think it's crazy that OM would be reducing your funding
at a moment like this
blink twice if you agree uh I what I will add is that the the funding that
you currently see reflected is the baseline funding for the program and uh
and we'll continue to work with our partners at OM but I mean do you think the the program is going to be
negatively impacted by that funding cut
uh we're in communications also with our partners uh we will be continuing our partnership with uh with the libraries
um and you know again uh with uh with OMB we hope to uh you know uh to to
continue those conversations for additional funding do you do you have a sense of how many participants attended the we speak NYC classes last year
um yes about 1,434 individuals and was there a
contingency plan or or for the folks that you served um who are attending
classes at shelters that might now be closed um and sorry uh chair I actually misspoke so and um because you said last
year so in 2024 about 5,152 individuals attended the classes
during our current uh calendar year from so from January through uh March 31st
2025 about 1434 individuals
so what about the folks who attended classes at shelters that that are now closed
can you repeat the question i'm sorry I missed that sure what was the backup plan to continue serving those who were
attending classes at shelters that are now closed migrant shelters so the so this so the classes that are being held
at shelters are run by our uh colleagues over at AASO um the focus of the classes
that they were providing were intermediate level um folks who have completed those classes are open to join
an intermediate level class at any uh NY uh New York public library site that's
participating in a program so a referral pathway is existing the beautiful thing about we speak is also that um
individuals have the ability to take classes on their own um and use the material that's existing on our website
which is also available to all the learners and chair if I can uh just to give you more sort of awareness about
the program about two years ago we decided to fund the New York City public library branches so that they can
provide these English classes across their their system so that we can connect newly arrived immigrants both in
the shelter system and in our immigrant communities with access to these classes prior to that classes were provided by
community- based organization on a voluntary basis and we thought that this would be a good way for us to spread
across uh better spread across these classes now uh you know with the
available funding we will continue this partnership with the New York Public Libraries and we hope to continue to add
resources to that um we'll talk a little bit about the
city's collaboration with the state the the state FY26 enacted budget includes a
little over $80 million for different immigrant related programs does MOYA ever collaborate with the state's office
of new Americans yes we're in in constant communication with our office of new American the state office of new
Americans in fact uh you know we we fund we contract with many of the same
providers including Catholic Charities that also uh oversees their hotline so
we have regular calls and we speak on a regular basis um you know again you know
um this is work that's important to both offices and we uh and we work very
closely with them okay
all right i'm going to turn it over to Chair Abilis uh chair if I may just to add to our uh your question on the
immigrant and ethnic media um work we've held eight roundts in the last uh fiscal
year in 2025 and our next round table will be on worker rights and immigrant communities
which uh will uh be looking to highlight the important rights that immigrants regardless of their immigration status
have uh and what to do as if they have been victims of workplace exploitation
thank you commissioner Chair Wilson been joined by Council Member Hudson
okay all right um so let's let's start with uh by talking about um the legal
support centers um so in fiscal 26 executive budget for Moya's legal support center includes 12.2 million for
action NYC aka legal support centers um 5
million for asylum seeker legal assistance network and 2.8 million for
the asylum seeker resource navigation center can you clarify what portion of
the 12.2 million for Action NYC is new funding versus baseline funding from the
previous fiscal
years so um the baseline funding for uh legal services is uh around
7.9 uh million dollars and uh the difference is uh digestional funding
that we're receiving in FY26 so the remaining
um six six mill and some is additional
onetime funding um well that's for um action um you know
for the uh for legal services uh at MOYA uh that's uh 7 7.9 so that um that's
that's the uh the number that that includes um the in terms of the the $12
million dollar that you're um asking about um in terms of legal services we
also uh got an additional um I think you're referring to the additional
funding that's reflected in 4.3 yeah I had to do the math now yes it's the four
uh yeah that that we got added uh in the exec plan that's that's one time funding
yes and that's coming from where omb uh is that coming from the AASO money
i would defer it to our colleagues um at OMB but that but that was added to our
You don't know where the money came from you're just happy to have it my Yes exactly but my understanding is that
it's it's not coming from the state funding that OASO received for this work
okay so of the of the 12.2 million how much is being distributed directly to
providers um so in FY26
um we have the the legal support centers
uh hold on give me one sec i can turn to my
chart um so in total for legal services
I think this will make a bit more sense uh for to talk about this
um for FY20 here we go
fy26 um the new 25 Moya legal support
centers will get uh 6 uh $6.3 million
about um that's what we have been
um budgeted for on top of that as the commissioner mentioned we will be
extending contracts for um some of the current
um legal providers under the former formerly known as action noy contracts
um and that will be about uh same $11.9
million i think um there's a bit of um um sort of to flesh out your numbers the
$12 million that you're talking about is what's added in the exec plan right um
so some of that funding that funding is a one-time uh funding that we have
gotten that includes um the 4.4 million that we received uh from from the
administration um the uh the formerly known as ASL uh which is fi the five uh
the $5 million uh in the uh for the in the funding for uh the program formerly
known as um as the navigation center i think that's what you were referring to
chair I'm sorry for the confusion no that's okay i'm I I have a couple different numbers floating around my
head so in terms of uh in terms of the legal support centers so
essentially despite all the changes in the contracts well it's the same amount of
money for the contract more or less from last year just a lot more organizations
right i mean it's more actually so you you said 6.3 million is going in fiscal
26 i have here fiscal 25 was 6.4 million correct so so it's going to be more uh
right so uh in FY26 uh MOYA is um is uh
consolidating programs right uh under uh the the Moya immigration centers right
uh and all available um you know and receive funding in FY26
uh will be added to that effort still through the baseline funding that we
have right can let me stop you for just a quick second i'm sorry i just want to make sure I'm
understanding because I I I feel like I keep hearing different things so of the
of the 12.2 million uh 6.3 million has been awarded for
fiscal 26 so I think let me go back a little i
think we were talking about So the 12 um the 12 million that you're talking about
that's that's the funding that has been added right in FY26 in the executive
plan that is not baseline funding that's additional funding that we have uh
received um as part of uh you know the executive plan so that's um you know
that's a one time um added funding that we've uh that we've received so you're
saying the 12.2 million is in addition to the 7.9 correct apologies for the
confusion okay so in still even then back to how much was um is going to be
distributed to providers so you noted 6.3 million for fiscal 26 which is less
than fiscal 25 so that's for the current uh contracts
for the I mean I'm sorry for the new contracts starting July 1st so that those are the new centers that will be
established uh on top of that uh we are extending um 13 of the current um legal
services contracts formerly known as as action NYC okay for one additional uh
fiscal year uh then that that will be about $12 million
for 13 uh of for 13 contracts so you're
going to extend 13 contracts for an additional year and then you're going to award an
additional 6.3 million for the new contracts uh that that and the new
contracts will start when July 1st
and can you provide the council with a list of providers and their funding allocations for this fiscal 20 uh 26
allocation that you've already made sure we can share that great thank you chair if I may add we're working towards as of
today uh having starting July 1st uh or
or in July 38 uh Moya legal support centers across New York City in um
neighborhoods where immigrant communities live
thank you Commissioner just um just for the record we want to make sure the 12.2 million that we were talking
about includes the 5 million from the Asylum Seeker Legal Assistance Network
and the 2.8 million from the Asylum Seeker Navigation Center correct okay
thank you okay right so starting in fiscal 26 programs like the Asylum
Seeker Legal Assistance Network and the resource we got to find shorter names
and the resource navigation center are inclusive of the legal support center um
why were these programs funding consolidated into a single budget and
will they still be run by the same providers so I guess it's an overlap of the last question
in part to address uh your last point uh to limit confusion as to where
immigrants can access services we want to provide the resources so that these centers house the nonprofits can provide
legal services and other services we're prioritizing of course legal services because that is what is in high demand
um Jess do you want to add to that um I'll start and then I'll pass it on to
uh my colleague Loren as well uh yes it's part of uh consolidating uh the
work um the work that has been done through the asylum seeker um assistance
network known as ASLAN um has been uh legal services that um that will be uh
folded into um the the services that are being provided by the these current
contracts um so it's uh you know and um we're also ensuring that uh we increase
the number of access points for immigration legal services for all immigrants right uh whether they're
recent arrivals or uh you know their um you know um have been here in the city
for many years or are also uh you know perhaps hold some sort of uh temporary
status but I'll pass it on to Lorena more yeah the only point I'll add is that um during the preliminary budget
hearing um over half of the public testimony focused on increasing legal services um so in a response but also in
a response to the need that we're seeing from folks from around uh we thought it this was the best approach to fold in to
to create additional touch points for legal services
yeah especially since we filed uh tens of thousands of asylum
applications to an office that is now closed with no information on what to do for those
folks so yeah we need it pretty bad um so in terms of the um how will MOYAY
ensure coordination and efficient utilization of resources to avoid duplication and services across uh the
legal support center NYC
so we of course work uh very collaboratively with the other agencies
that house immigration legal service uh programs like DSS HA OCJ in fact our
immigration legal hotline refers um u individuals to these services um and
we'll continue to work with them um individually and as part of our immigrant inter uh immigrant task force
that we coordinate inter agency task force that we coordinate got it and I'd like to recognize council member Brewer
and council member Botcha joined us um will will the ASLAN legal support
recipients contracts um end and are they being notified
um all of our contractors of our legal service contractors have received notification as of last week we are
scheduling follow-up calls with them um the idea here is to fold services um um
and we're we're going to be working with them in the next couple of weeks to figure that out with them together
when you say fold services can can you explain that um uh based on the last
statement you said in order for us to not duplicate services and to sort of streamline uh that's what I meant by
that got it thank you in terms of so the official start date for the new
contracts under the new legal support action
center i just totally merged the two names um that's what's happening in my
brain right now uh you you're going to give us were they all notified of their contracts or has
those determinations been made so all um current all current and uh new uh
vendors that will start July 1st have been notified with regards to the uh new
vendors that are starting on July 1st they're um they are working um closely
with our partners at DSS and they're they're working through their contracts um but more to come
and were there any uh providers that were previously funded under Action NYC
that did not receive contract renewals under this new model
uh in terms of um contract uh renewal uh extensions or renewals right there's the
extension and then there's the new model uh under for with regards to the
extension uh we had uh conversations with all uh current uh providers uh to
uh propose uh what that you know if they were interested in that extension uh all
but two um providers uh do not submit um
submit uh proposals uh so in terms of the current um pro illegal providers um
really just two of them didn't will not be extended for another year because
they were not interested in submitting that uh you know uh proposal um regards
to the new contracts um you know um again because we're still in the process
of these contracts being set up uh I can't go into uh you know list out uh
the current um selections but that will come uh in in the next couple of weeks
but are you aware so in terms of the extensions too that were not interested are you aware why they were not
interested uh we held uh you know multiple uh you
know uh reached out um we just uh do not do not hear back uh other than saying
that they were not interested at this at that point in time to submit uh extension uh an extension so they did
not inform Moya why they were not interested they ghosted you specific not ghosted us but they didn't go into
specifics okay um in terms of uh the renewals I so sorry in terms of the new
contracts um obviously there was an expansion in the numbers of um providers I think
commissioner you mentioned up to 25 in this new provider list uh essentially
the money hasn't increased in that pool are those contracts significantly smaller
so to clarify on the numbers of the baseline funding we'll establish 25
let's call them moya centers in the next fiscal year starting July 1st uh
together with the extension of contracts we'll have another 13 which amounts to
38 moya centers across New York City once we have that full list we'll be
publishing that online we'll make sure council members have that full list and
we'll let you know if any of these centers are located in your district so you're aware of services uh available
there so there's no overlap between the extensions and the providers the new
providers under the new contract there's no overlap there uh there will be some
overlap um and we will be sharing that uh in the next couple of weeks again so because some of these contracts are
still in the beginning in the process right that there will be some overlap i I I would imagine unless unless you
secretly grew providers overnight there has to be overlap there so that's what
we're we're interested in understanding um in terms of the
uh what were some of and I know we've discussed this before but certainly as
the new contract will take hold can you remind us for the record what some of
the primary reasons for changing into this new contract model was
partly is um to a um uh establish legal c moya
centers or providers within immigrant communities uh so that
uh residents can access these services in their own neighborhoods
um through providers that are most uh I think adequately
um established in these communities to provide culturally and linguistically
sensitive uh services
um yeah um I briefly add uh to that uh is you know um it's also to ensure that
um these uh new providers right um are also encouraged right to and we have we
will be working with them uh to build uh those uh connections and relationships
with uh other public institutions within those uh within their neighborhoods like schools libraries
uh as well uh to be able to uh to grow to grow their uh their network as well
but I'll let Lorena also add a bit more yeah and I'll add that um aside from the
language um excuse me the legal support centers there's also a legal technical mentorship component to it which was
meant um to very intentionally create a way uh to find support for legal
services for very niche matters um to some of these smaller uh nonprofits uh
but I just want to emphasize what the commissioner said um I think the idea here was to create a very hyperlocal
focus where uh legal service providers had brick and mortars that that folks could go to um
immigrant New Yorkers could go to within the five burrows
so are you saying under the last contract that that did not exist i'm I'm still trying to understand
what the differences are besides more providers
i'll I'll I'll let the commissioner expand but um I think the idea here is um that to create more um more touch
points really um in in ways that individuals from different neighborhoods
could come and and provide services i'll also say that needs have changed so the
types of legal service providers um who were needed to provide and respond to some of these changes was super
important in addition to that uh the idea really again to that mentorship program is capacity building like you
you mentioned sort of jokingly but re truthfully um you um the idea is to
create more um more legal service providers that can support um different ethnic enclaves and um sort of the idea
here is to build the capacity within within some of those new legal support centers that might have that capacity to
do so [Music] yeah I'd love I'd love to definitely
hear more about the the technical assistance component but certainly the needs once 100% have changed at least
people need full representation they don't need just a light proay anymore and you know with the changes in the
federal policies that existing cases are now much more complex
so just without changing much of anything the complexities that are needed within legal service provision
have significantly increased across the board without addressing even additional
new needs so so 100% and I just don't I guess I'd like to dive in later on about
like is is there real capacity building there because from what we're understanding what's happening on the
ground now is uh everybody is completely underwater and because of decreased
resources supervision structures are weakening people have too much case load
um and those have been and the service the amount of money that the city is offering to nonprofits is not sufficient
by any stretch of the imagination so it's still we still have this um real significant challenge in terms of how
many people and what demographic does the new model proposed to serve
so I I'll let um uh DC Sanchez or DC Lucero weigh in on
that but just wanted to add to the to the model what differentiates uh the
work of MOYA and uh the programs that are housed in other agencies is that the
this model increases the number of let's say touch points of immigrant communities to uh city funded programs
which is why we've decided to establish these 38 uh centers in immigrant
communities so that people know where to go to uh if they were to need uh
immigration legal services or other services i think that's been an effective model for us to be very much
rooted in community and districts and neighborhoods where immigrants live and
from there we'll connect them to city services available to them and to other providers
um and I think that's what we are doubling down in this new model and not
to say that we will uh cease to work with existing providers which again we
said we will be extending contracts for this next fiscal year u sorry chair can you repeat your
question at the top yeah we were somewhere else um what what um how many people does the
new model propose to serve um we're determining that number now um
because we're beginning the conversations with our contracted providers and I think the other part of
your question was demographic um also we'll circle back
and wondering if there is any distinction there uh from the prior model
once we finalize conversations and and um um finalize agreements with uh the
selected providers we'll be able to better assess that but our goal is to again spread the services across
immigrant neighborhoods in New York City uh and to pro provide as much linguistic
and cultural diversity amongst these providers yeah so so how does it look
for our home community what's the change that Sunset Park is going to see from
the old model versus the new model
um with we're again with um I can't really share the uh the list of
providers but there will be an overlap uh in terms of the services uh we are
looking to ensure that um you know we continue to have full coverage in all
five burrows espec especially in neighborhoods like uh like Sunset Park right uh where we have a large immigrant
community uh that we have uh centers uh either uh you know uh really close by
and or uh directly in uh in these neighborhoods so that uh folks can uh
can get these services with regards to uh the linguistic and cultural um uh
sensitivities right uh we were very intentional in this uh in this procurement to ensure that we continue
to prioritize that uh so you will see that also reflected in the in the providers and I I will just really uh
quickly add with regards to um to the new contracts of Saturday July
1 uh you know while there's overlap we also uh will see new um new v uh new
vendors right and this is part of building that capacity uh you know of uh
smaller CBOS and uh in being uh in community rooted organizations that are
providing this work as well in collaboration with uh with the new contract also that will be starting July
1st for legal technical mentorship for these uh new contracts so the ratio for
the new for the new um CBOS that you're trying to build capacity in what's
what's the staffing ratio we can share that uh in the coming weeks
as we're it's in the RFP wasn't it in the RFP the staffing ratios uh I don't
recall that from the top of my head but uh I think it was I just don't remember i think Yeah all so all of of course all
of the selected uh you know vendors um have met that right um So one of the
problems I don't know if you were able to solve this or you took it into account was that the staffing ratio was
inadequate for what the contract was hoping to achieve did you change at all the the
contract i know this has been a long long process was that ever addressed in the
contract was the staffing ratio improved because it from the former contract had
diminished quite a lot which goes against uh actually what needs to happen
so did you change the staffing ratios um in this final round if I can I'll
step in while Jess pulls that up um we did make significant amendments based on
feedback we received from you know uh the first uh versions of the RFX
and these amendments were made to you know uh make sure that there was
maximum flexibility for providers in including allowing them to and and Jess
can can weigh in allowing them to decide how they would staff their programs at
the amounts we we had um put the RFX out for which is
$250,000 per year for three years again
our preference is for our providers to be able to um decide how to best uh
staff their programs to meet those deliverables
got it and so currently do you does Moya have enough staffing capacity to to
manage the roll out of the programs or do you need additional staff lines to support these programmatic roles
we've of course always welcome additional staff we're you know we've made a number of adjustments within our
team to be able to best manage the roll out of these programs and provide
adequate oversight
i'm not even gonna do it um how many team members are currently dedicated to
policy work uh to immigrant services and what are their main priorities under the new
model uh for policy work we currently have uh three individuals focused on
that work will will they be working as part of the
new RFP model two of them will i'm sorry two two of the three two of the three
and what are their priorities under the model um well one will be working closely with
uh the legal service uh contractors providers um to to field and uh provide
support with the legal uh mentorship the technical component of it so we can pro
uh close work closely but also provide timely updates to our legal support
centers um and the other will be supporting with the legal support centers got it and has the uh has the
RFP made any accommodation for the increased complexity of existing cases
i'm going to say uh yes um the the contracts as they are provide more flexibility
um so folks can meet deliverables based on the needs that are emerging but again more to come as we finalize got it have
you requested additional headcount to expand Moya's team in in the near future to meet the demands of the legal support
center again we work closely with OM to determine this um you know we have an
existing uh headcount 63 staff we have how many
vacancies 13 vacancies 13 vacancies we're working to fill those up
um I think part of uh the reason we've established the technical assistance and
mentorship program was so that they can also provide adequate assistance uh uh
to the nonprofits that we're contracting uh which is why this this program is
essential to the work that we do
so you haven't you haven't requested additional staff from OMB you've you you're working on filling the 13
vacancies okay um so with the news of the nationwide blitz where ICE agents
are entering courouses to arrest immigrants and undermine due process now
um as we've seen in the Bronx what long-term strategy is Moya pursuing to
secure the resources that will be needed um in the years ahead to shore up and expand capacity
a lot of our work is focused on our inter agency coordination working across
uh agencies and offices so that we're in u close coordination and communications
um for instance um we understand that
our school system uh is um concerned about this weekend's
incident and uh one of our providers as was reported in the news stepped in to
support the individual and the family and we'll be working closely with the public school system and other agencies
in in in such a way so that we can um understand the needs on the ground in
the community as they occur so Commissioner um we saw just last week
many many ICE agents in the courts what what has Moya done in response to
this again it's essential for our immigrant communities uh to be well
informed of their rights uh and of the available uh services available to them
uh which is why we've doubled down on our communications efforts and wherever possible we are uh communicating
directly to them about about these rights and services uh that they should
know of uh as uh has Moya gone to the courts to offer that service or
direction to people who quite literally are being detained when they think they're getting a check-in or going for
any other court issue not the courts no yeah um okay um I'd like to acknowledge C
we've been joined by Council Member Hudson and Joseph sorry thank you um in
terms of uh the rapid re legal um the rapid response legal collaborative uh we
know that this program offers legal supports to individuals who are detained or at immediate risk of detention and
deportation particularly those who have not had uh or do not have the opportunity to appear before an
immigration judge um or are subject to expedited removals which we are seeing
happening quite uh a lot the executive plan includes 500,000 in fiscal year 26
for this program and the funding remains unchanged compared to last year's adoption in fiscal 25 the council
allocated an additional 1.2 million to three providers for this program can you
tell us um how many people this program served in fiscal 25
so before before Lorena answers this question you see Lucto answer this
question and just to clarify while Moya has not shown up to the courts or any of
the other sites our providers the nonprofits that we contract to work directly with the
immigrant community are in constant communication with their clients about
um any risk risks that they might uh face as they show up to court or to
their check-ins and so forth which is essential to do this work prior to uh
any instance that that they may be able that they may face non-local law
enforcement and possible action so yeah no the providers are underwater that's why we requested such an a significant
expansion of legal services support because the city is expecting the providers to do everything and then some
without sufficient support um so yes they are there but I would like to know
as a city agency who provides uh counsel and guidance to other city agencies how
are you engaged with court personnel if we see this continuing
um harm that is being done in the court system here so I was asking specifically
how Moya is engaging uh with the courts around this issue
um so can we get back to how many people the program served the rapid response
legal collaborative and FY25 um there were 88 screenings
and are there any weight lists for this program
i'm going to say yes yes do you know how many people are on weight list i don't but I can try to get that before the
hearing's up um when when the rapid response program
first launched uh it was shared as priority for city and state has the state continued to fund this program or
is it just fully funded with city dollars it's fully funded by city dollars
okay so given the flow of deportation cases has Moya formally requested
additional funding for the rapid response legal collaborative from OM
uh we continue to be in close conversations with them uh but did you ask them for additional funding for this
program in particular not in particular uh legal services
okay so in terms of um we're going to switch to unaccompanied minors uh the
number of accomp unaccompanied minors continues to increase um the absence of
clear sustained investment raises concern about the city's preparedness and long-term strategy for supporting
this vulnerable population is there any funding in fiscal 2026 budget to address
the needs of unaccompanied minors arriving in New York City or those who are facing immigration
courts um so I I don't have the number but I know that um I can say that we are
uh working with um IARE the coalition that supports um some of this population
to figure out a need um I also uh don't have the latest but I know that I care's
uh house at Department of Social Services i just don't have the number with me
so the the program was defunded I'm sure you're aware at $14 million
um several thousand children is Is the administration going to add any funding
for unaccompanied minors the cases haven't disappeared
they still sit with the providers with no money
so this is work that our colleagues at ACS oversee uh we're working closely with them and providers to see what if
the city can do with with um respect to this population we again we're also very
concerned about uh about the children that are left without services
did Moya ask OM specifically for funding for this program
moya didn't for unaccompanied minors moya did not ask for this as as uh for
this program as it's overseen by ACS uh I defer to them to answer this question
so you defer to ACS to do advocacy for unaccompanied minors no uh we've raised concern of
course about the um impact of providers and the children that are left without
uh legal services but again I defer to ACS to answer uh questions on their
program and how is how how is Moya then coordinating uh between the the agencies
in particular to support um the holistic well-being of unaccompanied minors are you gathering
ACS uh education housing are you doing any inter agency gathering specifically for
this vulnerable community that has been defunded by the federal government i know services uh with respect to youth
children families it's part of our ongoing conversations through our immigrant inter agency task force
um and again you know the programs that are specifically overseen by SCS and
other agencies uh they they request the funding or uh can say more about their
needs right Commissioner but but Moya's role
right is remind me what the role of Moya is for city agencies
yes again it's it's to help them uh help convene and coordinate across programs
but again I care is something that the office of civil justice overseas and uh
in collaboration with ACS and I defer to these agencies to to weigh in on their budgets okay so so have you convened and
coordinated on AC on unaccompanied minors and the situation we're currently in
um so Samoya has um spoken to both the Department of Social Services and ACS in
regards to some of the cuts that we were seeing federally in addition to also
speaking directly with uh folks from the IARE coalition
okay first of all I'm trying to get a sense of what is this action that is happening is it is are there meetings
are there actual requests for funding are what what is the level of action that is happening when we have seen a
straight defunding of some of the most vulnerable folks in immigrant
communities right children in particular so I I'm sorry I keep asking the question but I just want a very specific
answer either you didn't or you don't do it or you're in the process of it and this is what it looks like this is what
we're recommending or not recommending um so has the administration uh again
considered long-term strategies for unaccompanied minors who especially those who are aging out of use services
but still require support again you know this is an
ongoing issue uh and we're working uh uh with impacted agencies and providers to
figure out um what might come next
again the the gap left by the the funding of this program by the federal
government is is is vast and no one city can you know close the gap okay i'm
going to ask one more question and then I'm going to turn it over to colleagues i know you have places to go thank you for being here um uh really quickly so
in fiscal 26 we see that the funding for AASO was zeroed out um at the last well
I don't know if it's the last hearing um we understand that there were 27 positions that supported that office um
with funding considering um can you tell us what is happening
with all those 27 positions and resources
i can't speak to all of the 27 positions i know that some individuals have gone on to other agencies uh and offices we
are in ongoing conversation about if any will come to Moya but nothing concrete
yet
so you don't you don't know if any will be redeployed to Moya
we're in ongoing conversation but no we we don't know concretely
do you know what happens with all the case work that that was started on the OASO the f tens of thousands of cases
that they opened up for new arrivals
it with respect to legal services the uh the services provided were on a prosay
basis uh will be supporting uh those
individuals that need continued uh assistance through our our immigration
legal service programs and uh other programs across the city and how will
you provide that support we're referring individuals to uh
contact our hotline or uh any of our existing providers you know again this
is a an ongoing situation as the application help center winds down we'll
be getting information to to them as so that they can refer clients to us
will Moya be receiving all of the cent's infrastructure
no the application help center will be closing uh and um we as of now don't plan to subsume
any of those resources so just um um just for clarity sake I
did an application through the help center i'm now living somewhere helps
help center closes i'm supposed to know where to go
to open or check on my application or to get further support because I'm calling
the MOYA helpline that's that's the understanding with the tens of thousands of cases will find their way to Moya
they'll have our hotline available in existing services
um if they were to call the hotline they'll know you know that not not the
hotline the uh application help sell center that it is no longer active uh
and again when they were provided with those services uh the understanding was that
it was on a prosay basis not for ongoing legal support right the they folks did
understand that the city seem to have a problem with understanding the implications of that in the long term um
so we've learned through recent reporting that New York City plans to end case management uh that helps new
arrivals exit uh migrants shelters we understand that since 2023 approximately
100,000 folks were serviced through this case management program um services that
include finding legal aid jobs English classes with approximately 38,000
migrants still in our care uh can you tell us how many of them will um be
impacted by this cut in case management services
so to clarify both with with the services that you've mentioned and the application help center these these were
all funded by state resources which were not allocated for the next fiscal year
this is uh why those no longer will continue um and again many of these
programs were temporary as long as we had the resources to manage them uh
we'll continue to support uh people uh through our existing programs that we
fund uh as a city and uh just to note that those under our care are largely
individuals that arrived not recently so they would need a different set of uh
services right but there's still a significant amount uh with no real new dollars to
support the providers that are going to have to support this case load of work
right now okay um so next I'd like to call um
Oh sorry thanks thank you Chair we have questions now from Council Member Lewis
thank you chairs and good afternoon Commissioner Castro and to your whole team um had a lot of uh challenging
conversations with some of the groups in my district and parts of Brooklyn and uh hosted some mediations amongst them
because they feel that there's some contractual provisions that were unfair from your agency so I will ask you some
questions about that in hopes that we could get some clarity and further conversation so how is MoyÃ¡ ensuring
equity in the distribution of Haitian relief initiative and immigration legal service funding particularly as smaller
providers and CBOs have raised concerns that much of the funding is going to larger organizations like Catholic
Charities or with organizations with stronger ties with Moya like Life of Hope my second question is how is Moya
preparing to support Haitian TPS holders and West African migrants that are now
in portions of Brooklyn uh given the high risk of similar revocations and how
would the 1.7 million Haitian relief initiative baseline funding from H's
budget be coordinated to support humanitarian uh crisis support and my last one is in regards to uh your
testimony you mentioned that Moyer will be launching uh Moyer immigration legal support
centers about 25 of them and the numbers were all over the place regarding the 6.3 million but I wanted to know who are
the nonprofits that you all will be contracting with to provide this legal support um and what the what are the
metrics that you will utilize to identify those contractors those three questions
uh thank you council member um DC Sanchez will answer some of the
contract questions um but I'm happy that the Haitian response initiative in this
executive budget for fiscal year 26 will be baseline which allows us to then
discuss how the process to allocate the funds as a baseline project will look
like um I'll let uh DC Sanchez talk about the some of the other contractual
issues but again the the Moya centers that I
mentioned some of them are are funded through our baseline funds which will be 25 centers others will be funded uh
through one-year uh contracts that's what's going to get you to the 38 that's going to get us to 38 and will you
provide those locations and have conversations with us before that process starts and before the launch
happens well we'll provide the the list of um locations and the providers uh
very soon uh and have uh and make sure to let council members know if any of
them are located in their districts um because it's they're ongoing
contractual conversations uh I think uh DC Sanchez can can talk more about some
of the limitations to do with that but certainly we want to make sure to work closely with council members on this
thank you thank you so much for the question um so with regards to the new
uh Moya immigration lingo centers that will start in July um I'll start with
that um so that that process was through an RFX uh that was started nearly uh a
year ago so there's uh you know a process in place um what was the metrics that you used for that so there there's
a procurement process uh that is in place um like an RFP there's an RF yes
the it's an RFP that that went out uh this uh this whole process is currently
overseen by uh in collaboration with the department of social services where it'll be good to see what that looks
like what how the metrics is made up for the criteria for the RFP and because my
time is up I would like to know what support are you using for Haitian relief
and for the West Africans if all is that if all that is being bunched in together to support these two populations in the
midst of what we're going through in the midst of this crisis what does that look Like so uh really quickly um so all of
our um uh centers my immigration legal service uh centers are open to all
immigrants uh we do have folks that speak multiple languages and we do have
uh you know the centers do have uh language line available as well to support um and then with regards to the
Haitian response initiative this was uh an initiative that um that started back
in FY23 it has been year-to-year funding right uh this was uh a rapid response
that had to be put together um you know uh and it has been uh we have been
advocating for for this funding to be baseline right uh to be able to plan uh
to best plan long-term um you know thankfully uh as of next fiscal year FY26
uh that has been baseline for the outer year so now Moya is in a better position to plan uh to plan what the future of
that uh response initiative uh looks like right uh and to address some of the
concerns that have been uh brought up to you uh because so you actually understand the concerns instead instead
of internally trying to manage that on your own it's not an equitable process with who you have in place right now and
I was part of that movement that came together to make sure that this uh initiative was pushed through but it's
still not equitable till this day so it'd be good to have a conversation and meet with more than one member to have a
thorough conversation thank you chairs okay now we have questions from Council Member Hudson followed by Brewer
thank you so much i have um broader questions and then some specific to my
district but since January 2025 ICE has steadily increased its activity in our
city and providers continue to receive an uptick in reports of ICE arrests or attempted arrests in New York City we
know that ICE has picked up people at routine areas like near schools places of worship and many more what is the
administration messaging to those who fear deportation and no longer want followup with their doctor's appointments or are even willing to miss
school yeah I think it's important to communicate clearly with our immigrant
communities that um they're entitled to these services um as I did in my
testimony I made sure to communicate directly with immigrant communities i do so through immigrant and ethnic media on
a regular basis uh that said that there's a lot of confusion so it's important to to continue to repeat this
message and how does the administration propose to deliver services to detained and non-detained immigrants facing
deportation is there a continuation of of services
yes uh there will be continuation of services the services provided are
through our of course nonprofit contractors and they're allowable the
their contracts allow for this to occur the contracts allow for them to deliver services to both those who are detained
and non-detained immigrants facing deportation just to be clear yes okay
what need is there for additional resources and how much of an expansion do you think would adequately meet the
needs for immigration legal services as I shared in the last hearing the the
demand uh the demand for immigration legal services uh exceeds the need in our
communities especially as more communities uh need legal screenings and
support such as legal permanent residents so we're very much aware of that is there a number uh I said in the
last hearing we're we're we're speaking about over a million non-citizens that could use some type of immigration legal
service um over a million non-citizens but is there a a a financial number an
equivalent to that that would be useful to support those needs um advocates have
put this number at hundreds of millions of dollars again you know we we have uh
programs not just at MOYA but at other agencies that look to meet the needs of
the highest vulnerable populations but again uh as things change at the federal level more communities are of course
impacted okay thank you and then um three years ago the Hall Street complex opened in my district with almost no
advanced notice from this administration housing roughly 3,500 migrants with minimal support my office immediately
stepped up to serve both our new neighbors and longtime Clinton Hill residents we hosted a major town hall
with elected officials to address shelter capacity organized two May I continue chairs yes thank you organized
two resource fairs offering legal aid food and clothing we ran donation drives and delivered supplies directly to
families in need and we partnered with schools to enroll newly arrived children all without much help from the
administration looking ahead how does the Office of Immigrant Affairs plan to use its budget to better support both
the short and long-term needs of migrants coming to our city and do you believe there should be dedicated
funding and resources for migrant and refugee resettlement
well first of all thank you council member for the support you've provided to our immigrant communities um at Hol
Street and in your district this is one of the reasons one of the major reasons
why we've made changes to our model so that Moya centers are located in immigrant dense communities uh so that
we have better coordination uh in communication directly in the districts uh where immigrants live or where we've
uh you know temporarily housed them uh we're making uh we're learning from the
last several years and making adjustments uh again in terms of uh
resettlement programs it's hard to say um we provide
case management assistance for people to find their own housing within within New York City neighborhoods um but of course
affordability is is is a crisis that all New Yorkers have experienced right but I
just want to be clear do you believe there should be dedicated funding and resources for migrant and refugee
resettlement i want to be careful in how I answer
this question i I think you know um New York City should limit
um so migrant resettlement has been a
um an effort uh conducted by the federal government uh and immigrants should have
the choice to resettle or settle wherever they they think uh is appropriate um I'll leave it at there
okay thank you thank you chairs okay questions from Council Member Brewer followed by Joseph
thank you um my first question is I think for your workshops the ones that
are most successful in Manhattan are the ones at the restaurants are you doing those are those some of your restaurants
that get are the restaurants getting workshops the workers and the restaurants
so the priorities have been um and but also welcome an opportunity because we
have some pending workshops that are still available um through our immigrant rights collaborative our priority were
herks so phys at the physical herks um libraries as well as schools so as of
now we might have uh trained workers who work at restaurants but not physically at a restaurant okay but so you would be
open to doing workshops in restaurants that's where folks are so yes you would
be working to do that yes to to to fill the gap I need more than happy to
support uh workers okay we need that second I'm very um familiar with many of
the African young men because they're in my house and they're in my neighborhood and I'm up to here with them and my
question is health care so they all have NYC care they have no idea what to do with it some of their friends got
Medicaid a while ago not now obviously so I guess as my question is just
generally that's just a group I mean they don't know who they don't know who Taylor Swift is they're like in another
world and so my question is how do you communicate with them about these issues I can I'm doing the best I can but they
don't know where the to get health care they don't know they know to go to school they sort of know to get on the
bike and do the deliveries it's another world fani I'm learning fani i'm pretty good at it right now so my question is
how do you communicate with a group like this and how do you tell them how to get health care etc who does that
well thank you council member for for your work uh this is why our work with uh community based organizations is
important that said to get to scale we have to work with health and hospitals
and in our health care system overall which is why we held the immigrant media roundt couple of months ago uh so that
we can get this information out through uh news outlets uh that they read uh in
their own languages again it's it's challenging uh because a lot of these
languages are what we term languages of limited diffusion so we have to find every which way to get to them okay and
then the other question I have is just in terms of those that leave the shelters obviously the row and the
Roosevelt in terms of those families are closing in June so is that the responsibility of H&H case workers or
your case workers how does that information get transferred as to where they're going what their questions are
etc there are a lot of families in both of those hotels yeah I know case workers
at H&H are working very hard in the next several weeks to make sure that people
get information that they need those who are transferring to the department of uh homeless services uh should also get
information through that agency okay so you think that that's enough that they'll be able to handle that and then
what happens you don't know to the H&H case workers do they go to health and do they go to DHS or they have contracts
that end or we don't know yes uh their contracts are ending uh they've been
informed many of them are uh transferring to other agencies or other work it would seem to me that they would
be helpful because they're so knowledgeable about some of these cases is that something that somebody's paying attention to
yes they would be uh great additions to any team because they know the work on
the ground with these communities okay um just finally also we work a lot every
day with CUNI in terms of their support is that an organization that you fund or do they get their funding elsewhere
cutuney citizenship yes we fund uh Kuni citizenship now okay and they are um
funded to do the actual uh case work for people getting asylum or immigration or
green card etc is that correct uh correct they partly uh have funding from
us but also uh other uh funders okay do you have some senses generally how much
federal dollars totally when we had the cultural groups here they actually gave a number um from cultural affairs of 23
million as to what was cut from the cultural groups do you have some sense of what has been cut for immigration
from the god awful federal people um as was mentioned earlier it's in the tens
of millions i mean it it's an ongoing situation so it it's it's quite significant okay is that something down
the line you could give us a number we can make an analysis yes okay that would be helpful thank you have questions from
council member Joseph followed by Salam thank you chairs um a couple of
questions commissioner how are you um about that New York City student that they detained in ICE what kind of
support are you providing for the family and um when young people are going to court and that's what the chair was
referencing unaccompanied minors as well but unc accompanied minors as well what kind of support is Moya providing for
young people uh thank you thank you u council member um because of the
sensitivity of uh particular individual cases we don't often share specifics but
as was reported um in in through the media one of our
providers Nyl stepped in and is supporting uh the individual in the family we're very proud of the work that
our providers do in this respect generally speaking uh if if any individual or family uh need support um
they can call our hotline or reach out to any of our providers to see how we
can help and then often we we also get informed on our end is those pro is those um providers listed somewhere that
families know where to go to are they also provided to New York City public school students or families or immigrant
centers because I know this is one of our very case but from this case we can learn how to better support New York
City public school students who will face ICE yes we have a list of our existing providers which again you know
that will grow and we're working to to roll out a new version of that list as as more as Moya centers are added but
yes all of our agencies uh have this list available to them we also have an
extensive directory on our website that uh people can can use it's a mix of uh
organizations that we contract with and and and don't but that's available to them as well thank you um wanted to
circle back to and talk about we speak NYC i know that's a that's a program I used widely when I was teaching is that
in partnership with D79
no this is this is a um a program that is run uh solely by Moya solely by Moya
but in the executive plan you only have 617,000 compared to the 1.1 million that
was added last year so why was the budget reduced by 615 in the fiscal 2026
compared to 2025 in the adopted bud budget is it due to the closures of the
herk centers as well does that play a role in that uh no that that's an independent program
uh you know we still are in uh close conversations with OM about uh the the
opportunity and potential to add additional funding to this program uh in next fiscal year uh the the uh
$617,000 that you see uh reflected in FY26 as the baseline funding and uh
we'll continue to work with OM to If you need to expand you will chair can I And if I may add council member to your
question regarding D79 we do work with them to um encourage them to send students to one of our many um um sites
within the library system was that um funding the 630 was that repurposed to
immigrant rights collaborative in FY25 since the program will not continue was not continued in fiscal 2026 how were
those funds reallocated or absorbed um so that funding for um that was in
FY25 um you know due to the um high need that we saw uh in you know at the end of uh
2024 uh leading up to um you know uh to inauguration uh there was a high demand
uh with regards to know your rights right uh so given uh the limited funding
that we had uh we uh made a decision to pivot that funding and uh and fund
additional know your rights uh workshops with uh current providers as well as uh
you know uh do a large print of materials um uh that have been developed by our
office in our uh uh public uh in our website uh to be able to print those out for uh contracted Moya vendors and uh
and also for uh council offices as well do you have a number of how many folks attended this um we speak NYC classes
last year yes in um uh calendar year 2024 uh about uh the numbers the exact
number is 5,152 um and currently from January 1st 2025
through March 31st 2025 1,434
why the drop in numbers it's mostly because we haven't completed the calendar year so it's only until March
okay do you have a breakdown of locations burrow sites and um and why is
the Bronx the most underserved in the six locations that you have i do have a breakdown so currently um
for FY25 there's a total of 179 classes
72 were in Brooklyn 69 in Queens 10 in the Bronx 26 in Manhattan and uh two in
Staten Island um the makeup um is really determined in collaboration with the library systems um so that's sort of the
reason but we'll be more than happy to sort of look into that as well that would be great um and we speaks NYC is
still successful in terms of attracting new participant what are the criterias you use to measure success and that
would be all chairs what do you use to measure success
well I think for us um as you know with this this is really the entry point to
just languish services period so for example like my mom who might be shy to speak English in front of people this is
sort of the place where you get the very beginning fundamentals so for us um
metrics wise is the number of classes that you're attending um but also um the
ways that we are capturing some of the information so that's part of it but again for us it's really um encouraging
learners to continue their their journey with inter intermediate level classes and so forth is there an exit um survey
that folks take in order to say how well this is working or it's not yes I'm going to say yes um I just don't
have the number handy but but overall anecdotally folks have said that it's been helpful in encouraging them to
continue their their adult learning classes thank you chairs and can I if if I can council member just to clarify so
uh we have baseline funding for for this program and then throughout the year we often get additional funds added uh to
Moya's budget which we then invest in in these various programs not ideal for our
providers and we hear them you know but we are very committed to working closely with them so that they know right that
this may come thank you commissioner thank you chairs questions from council
member Salam thank you and good afternoon um I have a
question [Music] um about the immigration legal services
and the federal funding cuts fiscal year 26 executive budget includes only $4.4
million for immigration and legal services which falls far short of the $190 million requested by the city
council how does Moya plan to sustain critical legal programs given this shortfall especially in light of the
recent $200 million in federal cuts that have already disrupted services for over
1,000 open cases in New York City
thank you for the question council member um the the funds available to
Moya for immigration legal services are are not the only funds available for this work uh other agencies also um have
available funds uh for for these needs um do you have the total number Jess
um yes um I can uh also add that uh on top of the 4.4 4 million that you see in
the executive budget uh there were a couple of other items added um
$165 million for the Haitian response initiative um $5 million uh for the
program formerly known as ASL and $2.8 million uh for the program formerly
known as navigation centers um in uh in the executive plan for the total
the entire sorry and for the entire um city budget
we have I believe hold me one sec to pull up the number
uh for the city budget um the total immigration legal services investment
citywide is $42.6 6 million and what is Moya's contingency plan for
the 200 plus impacted legal service staff and pending minor asylum cases if
additional city support is not secured
i'm sorry council member could could you repeat the question sure what is Moyer's contingency plan
for the 200 plus impacted legal service staff and pending minor asylum cases if
city support is not secured additional city support oh I see the um
the application help center you know again you know the we've expressed our
disappointment that the state funding is not available to continue those services and the application help center will be
uh closed by the end of the fiscal year uh as I stated before um clients will be
connected or potential clients will be connected to our existing programs including Moyes uh and staff are um are
finding um new employment at at other agencies and within our nonprofit
sector and chairs i just have one last followup dealing with mental health
services for immigrants and asylum seekers immigrant communities particularly asylum seekers face unique
mental health challenges yet the executive budget lacks dedicated traumainformed mental health funding
what steps will the will Moya take to address this gap and expand culturally
competent mental health support and has Moya coordinated with
DOMH and or H&H to develop a joint strategy to deliver mental health
services tailored to undocumented and recently arrived populations as I've been working closely
with the commissioner of the department of uh health and mental hygiene um in
recent months uh we're planning to launch uh an outreach campaign for this summer specifically for these reasons uh
both the commissioner and I will be uh deploying staff and ourselves going into
immigrant communities to uh ensure that that immigrant uh uh New Yorkers know of
our existing resources we're also working closely with the uh mayor's office of community mental health uh to
continue to inform um our residents it's it's a priority for us which is why the
commissioner and I will be working on this joint pro project this summer thank you
thanks chair so in in in the vein of uh mental health
and just healthc care services in general are there any new specific investments that are being made in
fiscal 26 i'd have to defer to DOH and the mayor's
office of committee mental health uh on on questions related to the budget i
don't know honestly of any new investments uh but we we uh do play a
role in ensuring immigrants know about existing resources including their
hotlines and again this is this is uh going to be a priority of ours this summer as we launch this outreach
campaign
in terms of um in terms of the federal the federal government right now um in
this reconciliation bill we see provisions to penalize states that use
state only funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants by cutting their federal Medicaid funding how do
you see this potentially affecting New York City and New York State's healthc care initiatives to undocumented
communities yes it's it's something that I know that is of concern to our our health and
hospitals and the OMH uh leadership uh
we're looking at uh potential uh impacts on our communities and um again we can't
speculate about what may or may not happen but we'll we'll be ready to respond uh when the time comes
in terms of um given that New York State has historically taken steps to expand
access to health care for all residents regardless of immigration status do you foresee the proposed
um federal penalties forcing the state and city to roll back any of these
programs uh we frankly don't know though the city
um has been strong advocates of of expanding health care to all its
residents uh in that you know we have the adequate resources to be able to meet those needs
and in terms of how does uh Moya's plan to advocate at the state or federal
level against these policies um could harm immigrant access to health
care such as the provision in the budget reconciliation bill i'm sorry if that didn't make any sense but how do you
plan to advocate at the state or federal level against these policies yes we're
in close contact with our colleagues at the OMH again you know working very closely with the uh interimm uh
commissioner there to uh to bring our our teams together and think about these things uh as as we hear of any changes
uh or any impact we'll be uh able to respond together have you have you made
any public statements about about how harmful this reconciliation bill will be
to immigrant communities uh we have not but uh both or our three offices
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Health and Hospitals and Moya put out a letter uh com directly communicating to
our immigrant communities about our existing our ongoing commitment to our communities regardless of their status
i'm sorry did you say you wrote a letter to immigrant community members about the harms they're experiencing no we wrote a
letter um emphasizing our commitment to their care and emphasizing that they can
continue to access city services regardless of their status got it and then well in terms of if you haven't
made any public statements have you made private statements to state to our state
partners about the harm of this have you made any statements to to our federal
part who's left as federal partners about the harm of this uh we have not
that is uh up to our intergovernmental affairs office although we did put out
uh with the department of health and mental hygiene an oped um emphasizing
the importance of healthc care programs to our immigrant communities
has Moya explored partnerships with ethnic media to ensure that critical messages are reaching immigrant New
Yorkers in their native language particularly about the harms that are being proposed in this bill
specifically about this about this bill no although as I said earlier um our
partnership with immigrant and ethnic media is is very important which is why we hold these ongoing roundts
um about a month and a half ago we held one dedicated to healthc care and we'll
continue to hold these uh moving
forward in fiscal 20 the how does the fiscal 26 executive budget ensure
continued or expanded access to health care for undocumented and un and
uninsured immigrants in New York City i don't have specific uh details on the
on the budget um question i'll have to defer to my colleagues at the OMH and
H&H for that have you recommended any specific
funding levels to ensure uh health care for undocumented and or uninsured
immigrants in New York City to your colleagues again we have ongoing
conversations with our colleagues we uh defer any funding requests to them as as
they oversee the but have you made any recommendations is my question specifically moya no
okay so does the executive uh fiscal 2026 executive plan include any
resources for improving language access in health related services for immigrants who speak limited English or
indigenous languages for health specific language access not
sure if we have that information in front of us although we do uh coordinate language access across the city and we
have ongoing conversations with all of agencies including the OMH and H&H on
this matter in in has Moya engaged with the NYPD on
their recent policy change given um uh bicycle riders criminal citations
no is Moya aware of the policy of NYPD
giving uh bicycle riders and ebike um folks who violate traffic violations
criminal summones we're aware but have not engaged no
do you think it would be helpful for Moya to provide recommendations to the NYPD around the immigrant
implications of providing criminal summones for traffic violations rather than civil summones which is what they
did before much of these conversations will occur as we hold conversations through our
immigrant inter agency task force so when Moya is when did Moya become
aware of this policy change
i don't have the the exact date uh chair
perhaps when it was in the newspaper when we all became aware of it is quite
possibly but I guess now that you know that it is happening has Moya affirmatively reached out to the NYPD to
say this is bad for immigrant community members who rely on this mode of transportation to single them out and
unfairly provide a a criminal summon which could trigger federal immigration detention and
deportation knowing that this policy passed has Moya affirmatively reached out to say this is wrong thing to do
this is not a specific conversation we've had with the NYPD does Moya think it should have this
conversation with the NYPD these topics are often uh issues that
come up during our inter agency task force
meetings also um has Moya been keeping track of um I
think to her earlier point in the courts has Mullya been keeping track of ICE
engagement in the courts at all as as much as others you
know um you know as much as you know we uh
hear of reports again there's little ways we can know about these uh
instances ourself because we're not in any way co coordinating with with uh
non-local law enforcement right but Moya is Moya keeping track of any ICE engagement across the city at all
yes but again we uh it's hard for us to keep track because we don't know of this
information and we can't verify this information um just like most people who
are tracking this has Moya ever considered the potential
of being a place where you should track that kind of activity that could help
with both providers and residents engaged it would be very difficult for us to to
do that
okay okay just I I think we've um we've certainly belabored the point but um as
as you are aware um the council requested uh $ 109
million increase for the immigration legal services um enhancement and was
only granted $4.4 million do you think 4.4 4 million addition is sufficient to address the
current need uh like I I shared earlier the demand
um ex exceeds the need um in DC Sanchez described the total amount that the city
allocated for this again it's not just toya but other agencies as well if DC
you want to add to that uh no uh the only thing that I will add
uh that in the executive plan uh there was a a total of $42.6 million um added
to the city's um uh executive plan for uh immigration legal services
and tell give me the breakdown of where that's going to the 42.6 six that uh I
will have to get back to you i don't have that specific breakdown other than just just Moya's uh portion uh which is
the 12.2 million that we discussed earlier
great okay we're almost wrapping up here in terms of um budget and staffing um
you mentioned earlier that you currently have 13 uh vacancies um when we last met
you mentioned you had 11 11 vacancies so you have increased are you having
challenges uh getting lines
hired um well currently unfortunately uh since the last time that uh that we were
here uh we had a couple of attritions added uh so that's why uh we have now
more vacancies uh now we also have um now five candidates that are in the
pipeline um that are still uh that are moving through the uh approval uh and uh
on boarding process uh last time it was for um so that's that's sort of what uh
we're currently um are at and we're continue to work with uh you know OM for
uh to get those uh to get those approvals um and yeah and we're also uh
posting um some of these uh some of these vacancies uh currently two
positions are posted and a few more um will come online in the next couple of weeks so the five candidates you have
are for the two posted positions or they're for other positions for other positions okay and how long is it taking
how long have those candidates been in the pipeline for um it varies um some of
them have been there for almost uh a little over a month uh the re uh
recently uh others have been there um you know between uh you know uh six or
or more or six to eight months at at the very least wow that is a lot um so have
you experienced to your awareness um candidates that have withdrawn because
of that lengthy hiring six to eight months to get hired is enormously long
time um currently uh we're very uh thankful and lucky that uh all of the uh
candidates are still very interested holding on uh holding on again um you
know this is on a case-byase basis uh and you know in terms of the onboarding
process um and again we continue to work very closely with our partners at OMB and and uh you know to be able to get
those approvals do you know why it's taking so long six to eight months
or waiting they're still waiting it could take effectively longer than that you have any awareness what that what
that what's contributing to that length i do not have specifics unfortunately
is this typical have you seen this before is this kind of what it is
it it depends right uh I mean to to be on boarded to the city on average uh you
know it takes a few months uh so um yeah but yeah we continue to work with OM and
other folks to uh to get these folks on board as soon as possible
right so um currently Moya staffing structure is you have five in your in your agency and then everybody
else is in different agencies uh correct uh we have
uh sorry uh yes five lines under the mayor's office uh and then the the
remainder are split between uh the department of social services as well as
uh DAS and are the vacancies are they
concentrated on one or the other are they across both Dcasts and DSS both uh
DAS and DSS it's a bit of a Got it and you don't know to this point
whether or not you're going to absorb any of Aasel's staff not yet
okay with budget yeah I think so of course
all right I think we're good okay thank you all very much thank you chairs just
just lastly want to express my gratitude to both of you for convening this this hearing and to all our council members

okay whoever would like to start I will start go ahead good afternoon greetings Council Member
Brennan and Council Member Allis and the members of the Finance and Immigration Committees my name is Mon'nique Francis
and I'm here as the interim executive director of CUNI Citizenship now I'm
here to you I'm here before you today on behalf of the 55 city council funded
employees advocating for continued funding for an organization that is making the difference and empowering
immigrant immigrants at a time in our history when the people who built this nation are pe are being treated in a
cruel and inhumane way this moment calls out for bold leadership fearless
advocacy and the resources to ensure that every immigrant in New York City has access to free highquality legal
assistance after the 2024 presidential elections we saw the need to marshall a
quick response and took proactive steps to alert all of our networks our first
call to action was to submit applications for benefits under the outgoing administration existing
policies before the new changes were enacted we urged green card holders to apply for citizenship or to apply to
renew their status we encouraged those with work authorization and other documents that were expiring to new to
renew well in advance of the expiration date we preparedformational materials and addressed the anticipated changes to
immigration policies and advised non-citizens on proactive steps that they needed to take in advance of
January 20th following Jan the January 21st onslaught of executive orders
targeting asylum seekers paroleies and undocumented migrants our next call to action was to
offer know your rights and family preparedness educational sessions to community we quickly saw the need to
conduct these sessions via closed Zoom webinars to pro protect those seeking
information and to ensure that everyone could listen in the privacy of their homes to date we have completed more
than 30 know your rights sessions educated thousands of immigrants and provided information that is crucial
during this period to combat misinformation in the often circulate that is often circulated on social media
we prov we found a variety of channels to share accurate immigration updates we created a web page to highlight and
explain the policy changes from DHS and USCIS we sent emails to you and members
of your staff and alerted all of our list serves we also have a weekly reoccurring announcement in the Qun
newsletter which is distributed to more than 550,000 subscribers individuals affected
by these policy changes desperately seeks our help between January and April
our contact center system received more than 21,000 unique phone calls texts uh
text messages and call back requests this was a 30% increase in volume since November 2024 we made every effort to
pri prioritize those who are calling to verify what they were seeing and hearing
in the news for urgent inquiries we assigned an on call attorney to respond our team has been working tirelessly
with every group that has been targeted and closely monitoring every lawsuit filed to counter unlawful termination or
revocation of status we're offering virtual appointments to those who request them our leave staff holds case
discussion and case updates twice per week to ensure that everyone on the team has accurate and up-to-date information
to share with constituents the demand for our services has never been greater which is something which we anticipated
what we did not foresee was the targeting of lawful permanent residents such as green card holders and
international students under the new administration there's been an increase in deportations carried out by ICE
creating fear and uncertainty within the community because ICE officials have been largely targeting
undocumenting have been unable to locate undocumented migrants with violent
criminal records they've shifted their enforcement efforts to those who are lawfully in the United States using
pressure tactics to encourage self deportations to meet their deportation quota many immigrants are finding
themselves in hiring situations unsure of their options Kuni Citizenship Now is
providing support they need to make informed decisions about their immigration posture the reality is that
for many of us United States is our home we came here for a better life and will remain regardless of who is president
while the demand for our services continue to grow exponentially our funding will not allow us to meet these
increased needs we're seeking $5 million in funding for fiscal year 2026 which is
a restoration of the 3.1 that we currently get and an enhancement to 1.9
million council members have asked us to increase our citizenship days throughout the cities and we are prepared to do so
but we need those resources funding will allow program to expand by providing extra days of service at the council
member offices and creating a more robust attorney triage hotline since our funding in 1997 Citizenship Now has
become a beacon of hope to New York City and we're committed to continuing to serve frontline providers serve as
frontline providers over the next four years and beyond we urge you to maintain and increase support funding for our
services and for our program thank you for your time and consideration i look forward to answering your questions
thank you good afternoon uh chair Justin Brandon
and uh chair ais for immigration i am Carmen Deleon i am the president of
local 768 i represent the New York City healthc care employees i am also a vice
president to the executive board of DC37 i am here today on behalf of my members who work at correctional health they are
licensed creative arts therapists who provide therapy in group settings as well as the social workers who work at
Riker's Island on behalf of those that are incarcerated providing anything from
mental health therapy to advocacy and negotiations from within the uh jail
house itself to the uh lawyers making connections when they need them i am
here today because my concern of myself and my members is in regard to their safety uh while working at Riker uh
specifically for correctional health uh recently there was a workplace violence
committee meeting from H&H with regard to correctional health
they reported that there were in fiscal year 2024 there were 249 assaults
varying from a member being spat on to actual physical assaults i am here to
say that those are very numbers are very much under reppresented they don't report and my members in particular I
can speak to are encouraged not to report the violence or any physical
assaults they have been told "Well you just got punched in the eye but you don't have a black eye and you'll be
able to recover and come back." That is an actual story from some of my members
um as well as bodily fluids being thrown at uh those that are employed in
correctional health that is usually one of the most uh prevalent ways of
assaulting someone um so as we move forward I am asking the city council to
keep up their diligence in uh regard to correctional uh dom I mean sorry
department of correctional as we go to move towards to uh community-based jails
there is adequate understaffing as it stands right now and I can't imagine that 300 3,300 beds is going to be
enough to service the incarcerated population as well as provide them out
quate services thank you for your time today and I look forward to next year thank you
thank you so much for your testimony um I just I want to ask you a question Monique um first thank you obviously for
both of you for your different services of your constituencies i know city
relies heavily and certainly my office does on citizenship now's work um across
the city can you tell me I mean you in your testimony you clearly noted the increase and in one in one place you
actually said 30% increase in cases um from your perspective has what you just
heard the city testify have you have you heard do the changes that are being
proposed and or the modest increases of funding how do you think this is going
to impact the work that you you're doing right now um so we just lost funding
from Moya uh we received our notice last week that they're cutting the ASLAND funding that they give to us so I'm not
sure how to respond to your question on what the changes will be but but even in
terms of how about in terms of the question of the complexity of cases I think one thing you noted was I think
many people didn't realize was that this administration would certainly even target green card holders among others
we knew they were just going to target everyone um how has that impacted the level of
service that you are able to provide well the work that we do is primarily
prosay but while we say it's prosay folks still keep on coming back to us because we're there we've been here for
28 years so even though they get the we're not your attorneys we can only help you up to a certain point they
still come back asking us questions we still have to be the support they need and that's one of the differences
between what we do and what other programs in the city does
thank you i think I think what I'm hearing is and what I saw just a few
minutes ago is they're still cutting programs and patting themselves on the back for adding money somewhere else um
thank you for the work that you do you're welcome council member Brewer has a question i just want to say the same
thing thank you both but I have to say my office Citizenship Now at CUNI is our go-to place you are streamlined you are
responsive everybody gets service and I just want to say thank you you're welcome
please add my name to that pile as well okay thank you i'll see you on June 7 yeah right on i appreciate you guys
thank you okay okay our next panel we have Deborah Lee Katherine
Gonzalez Carla Astellaza Jodie
Zismer Luis Maneno Ernie
Colette and Sophie Dalzyr
okay you want to start from the my right your left just hit just hit the button on there
you go hi uh good afternoon my I'm Carlos Salasa i'm the managing director
of the immigration practice at the Bronx Defenders and thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today this
council's leadership and vision made possible the launching of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project 12 years
ago ensuring universal access to representation for detained immigrant New Yorkers together with Brooklyn
Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society we're requesting 11.06 million for each organization double our current
budget to ensure we have resources proportional to the mass detention and deportation campaign we are fighting
against since January we have witnessed a staggering increase in detentions a trend that will continue to escalate
given the recent opening of the Dellay detentions uh facility in Newark with
1,000 bed capacity as well as the new detention space in Nassau County our recent clients include long-term green
card holders detained at JFK undocumented parents and spouses of US citizens swept up in home rates and
asylum seekers detained at ICE check-ins in front of their children while doing exactly what our government asked them
to do our knifob staff has also stepped up to defend New Yorkers against new and expanded uses of federal law we're
litigating against implementation of the Alien Enemies Act which targeted hundreds of Venezuelans for renditioning
to notorious prisons in El Salvador we're challenging attempts to use expedited removal to deport New Yorkers
without due process and we're fighting back against active attempts by ICE to bring back deportation cases of knifup
clients which have been closed for nearly a decade we urged this council to act now to ensure we have the resources
to continue fighting back access to knif representation increases detained immigrants chances of success by more
than a thousand% we also lowered the social and economic cost of homelessness foster care and unemployment created by
immigration detentions and avoidable deportations we have represented thousands of detaining New Yorkers and
have the expertise and to train new advocates and build capacity to meet these moments with the council support
thank [Music] you good afternoon my name is Katherine
Gonzalez i'm a supervising attorney and policy council at Brooklyn Defender Services one of the knifeup providers
here in New York City thank you for the opportunity to testify today now more than ever New York City's knife up
program is needed to meet this unprecedented moment i want to highlight the ways in which the recent federal
policies and practices have affected clients represented by the KnifeUp program and why our advocacy is needed
today knifup serves New York immigrant communities in complex immigration matters in a rapidly changing legal
immigration landscape this complex nature of clients cases requires extensive preparation and resources the
current federal immigration reinforcement policies have a range of serious consequences for New Yorkers our
offices have continued to represent people whether detained locally or transferred across the country which
we're seeing more and more um with the Supreme Court allowing the administration to end TPS for example
more of our previously protected clients with families and lives here in New York will be detained and are being detained
by ICE with the weaponizing of war powers against immigrants through the alien enemies act people who we
represent are being threatened with removal to seek caught in El Salvador and other third countries with no due
process and this change has necessitated the filing of emergency federal litigation to prevent the unlawful
rendition and disappearance of immigrant New Yorkers and removal proceedings after the Supreme Court case we expect
to litigate on an expedited basis more individuals habius petitions to
challenge the use of the Alien Enemies Acts against our clients and not just clients from Venezuela but other
nationalities targeted by recent State Department uh designations including people from Central America and Haiti
when IRS immigrants prior to the resolution of their pending local cases here in New York it is infringing upon
their ability to participate in their local non-immigration court proceedings pending here in New York funding Knifup
supports New Yorkers ability to exercise due process in local proceedings here in New York including housing family and
criminal court thank you so much my name is Deborah Lee and I'm the
attorney in charge of the immigration law unit the legal aid society thank you to the committees on immigration and finance for this opportunity and your
ongoing support i'm testifying in coalition with the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project partners um but as
well um also the immigrant opportunities initiative contractors we are now 127
days into this presidential administration and its priority is to detain and deport as many people as it
can this federal government is trying to funnel more non-citizens towards removal orders or otherwise ready them for
immediate deportation in the past month the Department of Homeland Security began requesting that the Immigration
Court recaler thousands of previously administratively closed cases nationwide additionally ICE is now detaining
non-citizens at immigration court targeting them for uh targeting those who are complying with our immigration
laws and trying to have their day in court how can we fight against this onslaught we must take bold stands like
this council's fight to keep ICE out of Rikers we stand with you and will not be complicit in sending more into this
federal government's deportation machine overall in addition to continued and additional support we need flexibility
in our contracts we are eager to do all we can to defend non-citizen New Yorkers but also win our contracts to appreciate
that immigration detention may continue to expand and immigration court cases require constant but prolonged
dedication critically we need more knifeup funding we are the city's and state's experts in defending against
imminent removal but must have resources to meet the complex reality of detained deportation defense our knife up clients
are now fighting in immigration court but also in federal courts against unlawful removals under the Alien
Enemies Act and to third countries legal aid is asking for 11.06 million for each NIFA provider for II funding we must
prioritize legal representation in immigration court this is the most pressing need of non-citizen New Yorker
that non-citizen New Yorkers face and our funding must reflect that i do also want to clarify Moya's testimony
regarding a continuum of services that is not accurate we do not have a continuum of services for somebody who
is not detained and suddenly becomes detained legal aid is also asking for 1.75 million for our UMF5 funding and
continued funding for our low-wage worker initiative finally we ask that all funding reflects our full staffing
needs and costs as our staff are our frontline responders in these tumultuous times and we must be able to provide for
them thank you for this opportunity thank you my name is Jody Zemer i'm
testifying on behalf of the New York Legal Assistance Group or NYAG our city has repeatedly noted its commitment to
our immigrant communities legal service funding is essential to preserve the rights of immigrants and keep families
from the harm of detainment deportation and more we call for additional dollars
to be allocated to the city budget for these services increased investment that supports innovative and flexible legal
service programming to respond to the ongoing and emergent needs of our communities will give immigrant New
Yorkers a chance to live work and thrive in our city as noted by this committee
response to emergency enforcement action as we've seen when ICE comes into our immigration courts and detains
respondents when ICE arrests students at our city colleges and ch and the need to
challenge deportation to third countries and to preserve due process in the deportation process requires flexible
and robust funding including programming such as the rapid response legal
collaborative and the immigrant opportunities initiative the II collaborative um I will note that this
budget of fiscal year 26 does not restore the $600,000 in cuts from fiscal year 25 to
the rapid response legal collaborative we are the organizations that have responded to taking cases for immigrant
New Yorkers who are being detained and deported rapidly we are collaborating on
both a local and national level to supplement some of the NEFA funding and programming as well as um provide
emergency flexible legal response to the enforcement actions that um are coming
at a very rapid pace we also do track and report back to MOYA about
enforcement actions so that is something that again we ask for restoration of that funding in order to continue those
essential services
uh my name is Luis Manenno and I am the citywide director of legal services New York City i am speaking today on behalf
of my organization which is one of the organizations that is constructed to provide legal services under the IOI
contract i was as I was walking here today I was thinking about exactly how I wanted to um make sure that we
understand how bad things are for the immigrant community today and all I could think about was walking by 26
Federal Plaza where uh a bunch of uh New Yorkers and our siblings New Yorkers are
facing immigration proceedings and I was thinking about how just last week people
who were coming for their immigration removal proceedings were being picked up and detained when all that they were
doing was trying to complied with exactly what they were supposed to do the reality is that things are much
worse than they have ever been the work that our attorneys are doing and our legal services providers are doing is
much harder than it has ever been chairwoman Abules was talking and asking
about how bad things are for our staff members and the reality is that we do need more funding we are not able to do
the work that we're that we have to carry out especially today because we do not have enough funding in fact II is
defunded by about $12.5 million meaning that we fund about 50% of the work that
we do from other uh from other sources that we're able we have been able to find throughout these years the reality
is that not only things are much worse when we are litigating cases in front of immigration court but we also do not
have those sources of funding anymore so we're going to be facing a situation where we are not going to be able to
provide the services that our um New Yorker citizens need so much when things
are uh at the worst level possible so I ask here today on behalf of the
organization that I represent and the coalition that we represent to please you know help us advocating to get those
fundings that the funding that we need in order to be able to provide legal representation that is so vital for New
Yorkers today thank you good afternoon thank you so much for the committee for allowing me to testify my
name is Ernie Colette i'm the supervising attorney of uh the Immigration Law Project at Mobilization for Justice i appreciate obviously all
the city council's efforts for uh holding Moya and making sure that we have truth to power with regards to the
finances and the numbers and uh as many of my colleagues have already discussed quite frankly the funding is just not
enough for us to be able to maintain and continue representing a lot of immigrant New Yorkers
thank you very much Chairwoman Obvious for being able to sus out the numbers during the testimony but these are the numbers that I also feel are very
important for the committee to understand as well currently and this is just talking about immigration court New York State as of March 2025 we have a
little under a million people um in immigration court and approximately of that million we have about 62% uh that
are currently being represented it's that 38% that are prosay that really keep me up at night i know that anyone
here on this panel um and all the people that work for our legal services organizations are going to give them the
best possibility of being able to stay here in in the United States but that 38% is incredibly under attack when we
have an administration that's trying to effectively prioritize speed over due
process fast-tracking removal proceedings pre-termitting or terminating asylum applications that
maybe were considered to be adequate enough to get to the next step but uh judges are making the decisions that
they're not of course as we discussed earlier individuals being uh having their hearing terminated and then being
detained uh from ICE after leaving their hearing um cases being recalled
erroneously and then just policy changes in general with the OIR to make cases more difficult and that's only in
immigration court the communication and the advice aspect is fantastic it's excellent for us to be
able to talk to clients but as Mon'nique mentioned people are coming back to the same organizations over and over uh
trying to get more help and we're unable to do so we have a financial imperative here for the city but I also feel like
we have a moral imperative as well and it's our obligation as a city of immigrants to maintain that i know
you'll keep up the fight and we really appreciate it thank you
good afternoon my name is Sophie Dalsamer i'm co-director of the health justice program at New York Lawyers for
the Public Interest thank you Council Member and Chair Velis and members of the council for the opportunity to
testify today i'm also very privileged to testify with my colleagues here i'm in complete agreement with all of them i
want to speak to you this afternoon about the city council's immigrant health initiative which we are privileged to be a part of and ask that
you continue enhanced support for this program with a 655
$650,000 allocation to our organization for this upcoming fiscal year this work
could not be more critical in the face of unprecedented federal assaults on immigrant communities and healthcare i
was concerned today about the lack of specificity and urgency from Moyo when it comes to health care access and
mental health needs of immigrant New Yorkers and their families at our organization we are receiving and
responding to increased demand across four main areas first more and more people are being arrested and detained
by ICE as we know and we field many requests from KnifeUp and other partners for medical advocacy on behalf of
immigrant New Yorkers in ICE detention including uh forensic psychological evaluations that are critical to their
immigration cases many of the individuals who the city supported with prosay asylum assistance are now coming
up on their final hearings and they are unrepresented and we are hearing from many of those folks who are chronically
ill or people with disabilities who would have to face these proceedings unrepresented
we also continue to provide comprehensive health advocacy and insurance navigation to support
non-citizen New Yorkers who face barriers to accessing health care including advocacy with New York City
Health and Hospitals and connecting individuals to NYC care this is even more critical now as many individuals
are foregoing vital medical services in fear of ICE enforcement it has been critical to provide timely accurate and
trusted advice for these communities and finally NILB is responding to unprecedented demand from healthcare
workers themselves who are unsure about how they can create safe medical spaces for their patients and also protect
their own safety with your continued and enhanced support we look forward to meeting these urgent needs and
representing and advocating for our immigrant communities thank you thank you
no I just want to say um really quickly we hear you in terms of the overdue restoration of the legal services and
even that wasn't enough and I just want to ex expressly thank you and obviously
the panel before for the services that you have provided in this ongoing deteriorating conditions we know y'all
are the front lines and people are working really really hard um with not a
lot of support um so I just want to thank you and all your your teams um and
then I guess and also for bringing in actual facts and urgency into the room
that we did not see and hear uh several hours ago so I just have to acknowledge
that thank you um and we'll continue to to fight for all New Yorkers together
but deeply appreciate your services and your testimony today we have a question from council member
Brewer thank you be very quick first of all thank you Nyag for stepping up for Dylan thank you and then continuum of
care can you just descri I think I know what it means but when you say Moya said something that wasn't correct can you
correct it for us sure and I um invite others on this panel um uh again and I also echo you
know I'm really um so honored to be on the panel with all these superstars um
so with the knife of funding we can represent individuals who are otherwise
unrepresented who are venued here in New York City immigration courts or in New Jersey New York City residents um but
those are people who are unrepresented when they are detained and we're intaking them so and then the II funding
and although folks can jump in as well the II funding we're representing non-detained people so there's this sort
of there's this gap that exists and I think especially in light of these dismissals in immigration court where
somebody's not in removal proceedings anymore and then they're going to be whisked away and likely not be in
anywhere in the New York City area anymore those individuals are going to be disappeared they're going to be deported um and so I think there's just
this real sense of concern and urgency that these people are going to be immediately sent away we're not going to
see these people we're not going to see these New Yorkers anymore they're going to leave behind all their other families other um loved ones here that's very
helpful thank you just for the public understands thank you thank you all very much for all you do
okay our next panel we have Kennyanne or or Kenan
Pauls or Kerianne Pauls I'm sorry sarah Nolan
[Music] Uh I don't know how do you say that
sierra Craft grace Day grace Day grace Day margaret Martin lauren
Megalachio and Michelle Sion
thank you very much no I'm okay
from my right your left good afternoon and thank you to chairs Ailles and Brandon and to the New York
City Council for the long-standing support of the legal services for the working poor coalition aka
LSWP i'm Kianne Pauls and I am the interim executive director at take root justice one of the five members of this
coalition which also includes CAMA legal services housing conservation coordinators mobilization for justice
and nimic the LSWP Coalition was created with support from the city council 20
years ago to address the civil legal needs of working poor and other low-income New Yorkers whose income is
just slightly higher than the poorest New Yorkers thus rendering them ineligible for free legal services from
many organizations in fiscal year 2025 each of the five original members received
$455,000 from this initiative and in fiscal year 26 Take Root Justice and the other members of the LSWP coalition are
requesting a $600,000 allocation from the city council this enhancement would
support critical legal services and allow providers to deepen their impact in the areas where we are seeing
increased need including immigration workers rights public benefits and economic justice this is especially
important in this moment as the federal government is making it even harder for the working poor to maintain financial
stability and make ends meet and it is an exceptionally challenging time for our immigrant communities and just
speaking on behalf of Take Justice I'll say that this fiscal year the majority of our LSWP clients are seeking
immigration legal support so when the city invests in legal services for the
working poor we see that it's investing in strategic preventative measures to keep New Yorkers on their paths towards
financial stability and proactive intervention through access to legal assistance helps protect wages prevent
homelessness keep families in their communities childrens in their schools and New Yorkers out of poverty so thank
you again for your ongoing support and consideration of our request for the allocation of $600,000 for each of our
LSWP coalition members thank you
good afternoon Chair Ales Chair Brandon and members of the committees my name is Sierra Craft and I'm the executive
director of the IARE Coalition a city-wide network of legal service providers that for over a decade have
ensured that unaccompanied immigrant children in New York City have access to free legal representation thank you for
uplifting the needs of unaccompanied children um throughout the hearing this morning um we're in a moment of of
urgent crisis one that is unfolding in real time and in plain sight unaccompanied children are being
targeted through harmful policies and systemic failures and the consequences are playing out in our neighborhoods and
courtrooms every day children's dockets are being fast-tracked kids are receiving court dates before they've had
a chance to find a lawyer ice agents are conducting so-called wellness checks at showing up at 6:00 a.m at children's
homes asking probing questions even when their cases are already closed these visits are sewing fear and mistrust in
communities that are already on edge new sponsor requirements like fingerprinting background checks and strict ID policies
are keeping families apart we're watching family separation play out again here in New York City and recently
we had a young teen a child just herself who missed the hearing because she was giving birth during her her court
hearing but the judge ordered her removed anyway she didn't have a lawyer and she turned to us but our providers
are at capacity this is what it what it looks like when due process is denied when
children are forced to navigate one of the most complex legal systems in the country alone with everything at stake
we should all be outraged at a moment when legal services the need for legal services is exploding
the safety net is collapsing federal dollars are unstable and unpredictable and the government is currently buying
themselves some time to dismantle protections that would further endanger children and making it impossible for
them uh to plan for an attorney nonprofits can't plan like this
providers are having to lay off staff freezing intakes and turning children away city council has long been a
champion through the unaccompanied minors and family initiative but funding hasn't increased in over six years
despite the skyrocketing case loads and rising costs and the landscape is shifting by the day today we're asking
the city to meet the urgent need of this moment and that's why we're respectfully requesting 6.3 million through UMFI to
stabilize and sustain legal services across seven providers for 2013 children
and families and also $5.4 million in emergency funding to support the loss of
federal funding new York New York State turned its back on these kids in this year's budget making the city's role
even more critical we can't allow children toddlers and teenagers to be railroaded through a system they can't
possibly navigate alone thank you for your ongoing leadership advocacy and standing for young
immigrant New Yorkers
hi good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to testify today chairs Brennan and Avulz my name is Sarah Nolan
i'm the managing director of Kids in Need of Defense known as K's New York office we are also here as a member of I
the IARE coalition kind thanks city council again for your support in providing free legal
representation for unaccompanied children to add a little color um to a Sierra's testimony um we are also here
to ask for um incredibly important increased support for our work to counter the relentless efforts to strip
away legal protections for unaccompanied children who are now on the front lines of the mass deportation agenda
ice is conducting what they call wellness checks at homes with the intent to intimidate and further traumatize
children and their sponsors the reconciliation bill that just passed the House eviscerates
protections for unaccompanied children and could charge them up to $15,000 for
many of them to be released from custody and to apply for legal status which would bar them from accessing any kind
of protection the administration is also seeking to end the florist settlement that limits the amount of time children
can be detained and requires they be held in safe and sanitary conditions we've seen children who would have been
out of detention within weeks be held for now months because their parents and
caregivers cannot provide the ID or proof of finances for them to be
released at this moment unaccompanied children are in dire need of secure robust local funding for legal services
as the future of the federal support for this work remains very uncertain in March the federal contract that funded
over half of our work was abruptly cancelled in the weeks that followed the children who would have received kind's
advice and assistance under this contract no longer had access to counsel this included four children who decided
to return to their home countries without their parents or legal guardians there even there to receive them it
includes a teen from West Africa who has been already been in foster care for 18 months who confessed to us later how
scared and confused he was to suddenly have to go to court alone it includes a four-year-old girl from a central
America who was separated from her grandmother at the border after litigation was filed and in
an injunction was entered federal funding for these services has been temporarily restored but the administration continues to fight this
case in court and signal its intent to take away all protections from unaccompanied children we cannot rely so
heavily on federal funding in this climate to provide the foundation for legal assistance that these children so
desperately need data shows immigration judges are almost 100 times more likely
to grant legal relief when an unaccompanied child is represented by council this legal pres representation
provided by kind and Iare members is the key to increased stability for unaccompanied children and safeguards them from human trafficking and
exploitation we respectfully ask city council at a minimum to support the 6.3 million in renewed funding requested by
IARE and to allocate an additional 5.4 million in funding given the increased needs and uncertain future of funding
additionally we asked for the renewed funding for the II initiative thank you so much for your commitment to ensuring that all unaccompanied children in the
city remain safe and achieve their full potential
good afternoon uh council members chair vas chair Renan my name is Grace Day i'm a staff attorney at The Door a
comprehensive youth development organization that has been supporting young people in New York City since 1972 um we offer free access to healthcare
mental health services housing support education meals and legal assistance um and in 2024 alone our legal services
center handled more than 3,300 immigration matters um many of the young people that we represent are
unaccompanied children and we are part of the IARE coalition and receive funding from from the city um as you
we've been speaking about uh you are aware that unaccompanied children enter the US without a parent or legal guardian these children often qualify
for asylum or special visas for abused or abandoned children but without legal support they may never access the
protection they deserve shockingly as I think you know children have no right to an attorney in immigration court to help
them plead their case of course young children are unable to understand the complexities of everchanging immigration
law and effectively argue the merits of their cases children with representation in immigration court are seven times
more likely to access immigration relief and therefore as we fight the uphill battle that the next four years will
bring and are currently bringing as we're discussing we ask for the support of city council in the face of a federal
administration that is committed to targeting and terrorizing immigrant communities our city can use our
resources to defend these communities and to protect children iare funding for NYCU youth is critically important
because it provides essential legal representation for unaccompanied children in New York City who are un who
are now sometimes over 18 who are unable to be represented on other federal contracts increased funding for IAER at
the door ensures that we can connect these youth to legal representation but also to our suite of other vital services increasing the reach of this
funding as we support these youth transitioning to adulthood by investing into the IARE coalition and expanding
the support for the door city council can help us protect immigrant youth promote safety and stability for immigrant
communities today I urge city council to support immigrant youth in the city specifically I echo Sarah and Sierra's
request to fully fund the IARE coalition for $6.3 million and increase this funding as we face the terrors that are
um in our city um also I asked for the emergency funding for immigration legal services legal service providers and
expanding the support through welcome NYC and II funding with these supports we can continue defending immigrant
youth and offering them the protection and dignity they deserve thank you for your time and
consideration good afternoon my name is Michelle Sinc i am with Safe Passage Project i'm a government grants manager
thank you so much for the committee on immigration and on finance for having us um testifying today uh Safe Passage
Project is a nonprofit legal services organization that provides free representation to immigrant children
facing deportation right now we represent over 1,400 unaccompanied minors across New York City and Long
Island we're a proud member of the co um IARE coalition and our goal is simple we
just want to ensure every unaccompanied immigrant child in New York has access to high quality legal representation
most cases take three to six years due to serious backlogs in immigration court USCIS and family court they're legally
complex emotionally intensive and increasingly unpredictable with shifting federal policies and increased ICE
enforcement our work is made possible through the city council support particularly through um the
unaccompanied minors and families initiative but we are at a breaking point and I want to highlight some
urgent issues we are very grateful for the council's ongoing commitment to the IARE coalition but the funding has not
changed in over six years despite inflation rising case loads and increased complexity safe passage
project has um requested an increase to our IARE funding without success and for
FY26 we are again respectfully requesting the support of IARE through um funding for $6.3 million which
includes an increase um to safe passage project of 200,000 we are also requesting $100,000 in discretionary
funding for this fiscal year to ensure we can support our um the increasing number of children impacted by
immigration policy changes and enforcement our team including a pipeline of train attorneys and social
workers is ready we can act immediately to expand services we would also like to emphasize that while prosay models of
immigration services are useful for limited types of relief they cannot be the beginning and end of widescale legal
services for immigrants in the city we commend the city's asylum application help centers for assisting thousands in
meeting their asylum deadlines but these centers are not useful to unaccompanied minors unaccompanied children are placed
through the office of refugee resettlement and they face challenges in USCIS EIR and family court these cases
cannot be handled with limited scope they need dedicated attorneys who can see their cases through to resolution as
mentioned we were impacted by the termination of the unaccompanied children's program um our clients have
been visited by HSI for wellness checks these visits are deeply stressful and traumatizing experiences there are now
reports from national um partners in Connecticut and um neighboring states of
caregivers who are immigrants and sponsors of these children being placed being detained and placed in their own
removal proceedings following these visits it this destabilizes the child's case and it can shatter their support
system that they rely on in the US we are investing more time as an organization and more resources just to
keep our clients safe additionally our legal department receives at least one referral per week directly from foster
care agencies serving youth in ACS custody for long-term immigration representation while some of these cases
do qualify under IARE many don't because they're not in removal proceedings the cases that fall outside of existing
grant scopes are difficult for us to place and there's no dedicated city um funding stream for them without one many
children are left unrepresented not because their case is less urgent but because the system is not accounting for
them we are here today because we are deeply concerned about the lack of funding for youth who falls outside um
existing grant scopes we want to highlight the um increased absence of um
the increase uh the absence of an increase for IARE contractors by years of advocacy and the escalating
complexity of our clients legal um and personal needs without meaningful investment this year we risk abandoning
vulnerable children to navigate an increasingly complex immigration system alone thank you for your time and
dedication to supporting our work with New York City's immigrant youth
[Music] good afternoon and thank you chairs Brennan and Naves my name is Lauren
Millacho i am the training and legal technical assistance director of the immigrant justice corps which is the
first in the nation to place legal fellows at legal nonervice uh immigration providers uh since my most
esteemed co-panelists today have covered a lot of what I was going to speak about for New York's most vulnerable
populations i would like to first address your opening remarks chair and put some numbers here that I think can
shed a little light on why this is so important igc currently has 19 fellows
serving this community but that is funding that is dependent on the federal government and on March 24 March 21st
2025 the federal government did terminate that contract leaving many
children 26,000 exactly without funding for legal
service there has been a deep impact on the legal service providers here in New York City many organizations have looked
to layoffs have paused intakes and have turned children away for
representation eliminating federal funding will leave thousands of children without counsel and specifically here in
New York City in fiscal year 24 3,475 children were released from the
Office of Refugee Resettlement to New York City that is a number of children
that will be facing gaps and um instability in legal service
representation the looming fender federal cuts just leave a gaping hole
for no safety net left in these children and we do urge city council to take action and ensure that no child centered
representation is left and that every unaccompanied minor will be represented in New York
good afternoon Chair Ales Chair Brandon committee members thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today my name
is Margaret Martin i'm the co-director of immigrant and refugee services at Catholic Charities Community Services in
New York i'm here today to ask you to continue to advocate for a city funding
and awards process that meets the need of nonprofits to operate sustainably and recognizes this moment that we're in um
of increased and shockingly aggressive enforcement including at our New York City immigration courts and at the same
time as the federal administration is ending multiple pathways for immigration status and um Chair Abelis as you
recognized earlier that has made many of the cases that we do in legal services is more complex um and more urgent than
was true six months ago catholic Charities is a member of two II
coalitions including Iowa and with the legal aid society as well as the IARE coalition we are also one of the um
organizations that along with others up here had uh had our funding terminated
abruptly by the federal government to represent unaccompaning children in March um and I support and agree with um
the positions that my fellow panelists have stated uh with respect to those programs um Catholic Charities is
grateful for recent contract notifications from Moya um for renewal
of and an renewal and a new award um of some contracts so first of all we
received notification that the HRI Haitian Response Initiative Legal Services was renewed as well as our
hotline unfortunately those renewal amounts were not increased um to keep
pace with our increased expenses in fact for both hri and hotline we lost funding
that we were awarded last year to supplement the baseline funding for both hri and the hotline that means that we
will either need to supplement those programs with other funding or reduce services
um for hri uh many of the the individuals that we serve through hri
are facing increasingly complex and more urgent cases um and for them to lose our
assistance now for us not to be able to respond to the community need um would be extremely unfortunate so we ask that
you advocate for more funding for that program um as well as the hotline where we continue to see more urgent callers
um particularly as you noted with the closing of a O A O A O A O A O A O A O A O A O A O A OASU we AASU and the asylum
application help center we may see more of that um in coming months um and then finally uh Catholic Charities is a
member of the day labor worker initiative along with um five other providers and we request an increase to
$4.97 million for fiscal year 26 to fund the day laborer workforce initiative
thank you so much
thank you so much for all of your testimony and work um I I think I'd like to start with a question for you that
you noted um losing Alan funding i'm um deeply apologetic of not honing in
and asking them exactly where that money was going um I don't think I was going
to get an answer anyway because they don't seem to answer any much much of anything but in terms of
um I guess the reconstructed contracts like I feel like all we're doing is moving chairs around
the deck and calling it something different and wasting a lot of time and resources and aggravation for providers
to have to reapply to these new programs and constructs
um but um I guess you noted renewals of some
contracts that have remained flat but then losing others from the same entities that are going to be deciding
and saying there is seemingly more money i don't know where the more money is
i I don't think I have an answer to your question i don't know if I even have a question for you at this point i I did I
did want to note we did get a legal um support center award as well um although
as we've testified and many others have as well those awards do not cover the the required staffing or deliverables um
and we are also and this may in part answer what you were getting at we are one of the action NYC providers that was
notified that we got a contract a one-year contract extension um I think that's separate from the OS
on funding but I'm not I'm not entirely sure yeah I guess maybe by a show of
hands um how many of you have had conversations with Moya around the
disappearance of the federal contract and gotten any indication that there is
resources to for unaccompanied miners in
particular no one so the same conversation that Moya is having with OMB seems to be the same conversation
they're having with y'all which is not a whole lot of anything cuz it's clear there's a huge gap here that the city
should be feeling really super urgent to begin to address maybe it can't do the whole thing but there should be a plan
and we received no indication there is no plan but people are in a lot of conversations with each other
apparently thank you for your work and advocacy
thank you all very much okay our next panel
uh Iri Omar Gaban Harold Dusk
Robert Aznikad sorry Robert Aging
Agmang Arcelis Lucero Reva
Shang and Maline Bravo
how's your back you should have like a stand up desk
uh okay you want to start from the my right your left just turn your mic on
just hit the little button on the bottom all right good afternoon all uh my name
is Harold Dusk and I'm here on behalf of HaitianAmerican United for Progress
HUP a nonprofit organization that has proudly served New York City immigrants
and refugees community since 1975 hope's mission is to empower immigrants
and refugees by providing the tools and support they need to thrive we offer a
range of essential services including immigration assistance English as second
language instruction maternal and infant health program our work is guided by the
principle of equity access dignity helping community members
navigate complex system with confidence and respect one of the greatest challenges
facing immigrant New Yorkers today is language access
without access to skilled interpreters and culturally competent language
services individuals are often unable to obtain vital resources such as legal aid
health care housing and education as our city's immigrant population continues to
grow the need for comprehensive language access services becomes more urgent the
language access coalition representing immigrants from Africa Asia Central
America and the Caribbean has proposed the development of language banks and
interpreters cooperative these initiatives are essential to ensuring
that all New Yorkers regardless of language can fully access the services
they need and deserve this year marks hopes first as a member
of the language justice collaborative with support from this initiative we've
invested in the language proficiency testing interpreter and staff training and program development to strengthen
our language access services these investment have been vital to expanding
our capacity and improving service quality at the same time hope has experienced
significant cut in federal state and city funding due to recent policy
changes this reduction have placed enormous strain on our program just as
demand for services continue to rise today we respectfully urge the city
council to restore and expand funding for language access services without
sustained investment community based organization like hope will struggle to
meet the needs of the people we serve language access is not a privilege it is
a fundamental right and a vital public good i thank you for your time your
leadership and your continued commitment to building a more equitable and inclusive New York City thank you
good day Chairman Brandon uh Chairperson ALES my name is Robert
Aimang i'm the vice president of advocacy for the New York Immigration Coalition a statewide umbrella policy
and advocacy organization with over 200 members uh who are immigrants serving i
wanted to take the time to just thank you for creating a space for immigrant-facing
uh organizations to be able to speak about the executive budget my testimony
in total uplifts a ton in a host of different immigrant related programs and
fundings that varies the spectrum that impacts all immigrant New Yorkers but I
wanted to specifically talk about language the language access workforce initiative today uh specifically that it
is still remains a critical need um while working with our dedicated
colleagues from Hope and MASA and African Communities together Asian-American
Federation we continue to make strides with regards to the cooperatives the
language the language services worker owned cooperatives and we want to continue to develop and grow these
programs with respect to the community interpreter bank We're continuing to
forge ahead with its first cohort being of interpreters finalizing their
training in mid June and moving on to potentially medical and legal
interpretation uh certification depending on you know if they're able to finish the course and
wanting to acknowledge the work that we have done as well as with our partners
nice Lakomea Miss Tekka IC in continuing to broaden the pool of
interpreters and finally just wanting to uh put into the record we are
requesting the intentional baselining of funding for 7.8 8 million for the whole
initiative the cooperatives and the community interpreter bank for the continued development the consistency
that's needed for this program to begin to scale for the cooperatives and the
bank and just continuing to uplift the need for this executive budget to
reflect the urgency to deal with the affordability crisis the looming budget cuts and the
overcriminaliz ization of black and brown communities thank you
hello everybody my name is Arisero from MASA thank you for the opportunity to testify today um I'm also going to focus
on language justice but also have other nuggets in there that we wanted to plug in um we are an organization that is
based in the South Bronx we partner with immigrant communities from Latin America
and indigenous communities living in New York City to strengthen literacy leadership and power um as an our
immigrant community and advocates continue to navigate a cruel anti-immigrant political climate that
seeks to instill fear and rip families apart I think we understand the urgency we are facing and the need for continued
support um I'm going to start off with just echoing the ask from um the New
York Immigration Coalition the 7.8 million that we're requesting for the continuation of the Community
Interpreter Bank and the funding for the language workerowned cooperatives being led by MASA ACT and Asian-American
Federation we started this project in 2017 and be before that um with local
law 30 um to focus on ensuring that languages of limited diffusion were also
equally able to access interpretation
um services that were of quality um and this would include community legal
health and education interpreting as part of this initiative we currently do you guys hear that
maybe it's my computer
give me one second okay so as part of the initiative we
currently have 127 interpreters in the pipeline 52 of which are currently taking workforce development classes to
support their journey towards becoming interpreters um we have um approximately
40 interpreters who are going to be trained by the end of June 27 of those interpreters are English and Spanish
they hail from Mexico Peru Puerto Rico Dominican Republic Colombia Ecuador and El Salvador and we have um 13 indigenous
interpreters who are currently being trained in mom mea tunavi nawal garifona
and ketwa and we have students that um speak boretcha kichua kiche and hian
creole also in the pipeline um 23 of our um districts have been outreached and
were part of the uh process and this summer we um intend to continue to train
interpreters to do their practice and to um pick where they want to specialize
and I talk about all of this because it is really really like we've gotten this far and it's really important to
continue to support this initiative there's a lot of interest and a lot of people that have the assets of our
languages to offer and to provide better services especially in this need where due process is being um violated and
immigrants um don't really know what to do increase to access and education in
the languages that they speak is really important i also wanted to um briefly
talk about the prosay plus project and really focus on the plus part this is
part of the Ocelon network as we're finding out today that most of those providers um as part of that project
aren't being funded we have not yet heard but we did want to share that um
we have part of our funding is funded by Moya and the other part is privately funded by foundations um the importance
of that project um is that just like everybody else has spoken about the um
OASO closing people need to go somewhere a lot of those people are coming to all
of these organizations some of the work that we're focusing on is how to do trial prep preparation for them what to
expect how to be able to fight their case we heard the how overwhelmed um
lawyers are and so part of this work is to continue to support the people who
are or who have to navigate the process prosay you know give them a little bit more of an opportunity um we continue to
develop educational resources so that they're accessible to a larger community
and part of that project also includes ensuring that um there's translation and
interpretation services the how this all fits is that afilingual
and um our nonprofits are also being tapped into to do that work and we've provided interpretation services for
people going to their asylum um interviews um trying to go to the court
and we're getting increased requests and so there's an urgency to continue to move the interpreters that we currently
have through the pipeline and to specialize them and we can't do that without the continued funding so it'd be
really sad to see that just be cut abruptly um we're also here to advocate
for the rapid response network and um knife up and last I'll just plug in two
more initiatives the adult literacy initiative we need to continue to provide opportunities for our community
to be able to progress and to move into workforce development irregardless of
where there's a lot of fear but they still deserve an opportunity to go learn and to live their lives you know and to
better themselves and last but not least I do want to call for increased funding
for the um communication initiative with the New York public school system right
now it's at 3 million we're asking it to be increased for 7 million and again
that additional 3 million is to go towards meeting the growing need for translation interpretation services in
the school system which as we see is uh is being impacted and prime place for
community members to get information thank you for your time
um thank you Chair Brennan and Chair Vles and the Committees on Finance and Immigration my name is Reva Shang i'm
the economic empowerment community organizer at the Asian-American Federation where we represent a
collective of 70 plus member nonprofit organizations serving 1.5 million Asian
New Yorkers at AAF we believe that we should welcome all immigrants with fairness and dignity asian New Yorkers
are the fastest growing demographic in the city making up over 17% or one in six of the population af's rapid
immigrant support and empowerment or rise initiative is facilitating new immigrants access to critical services
and supporting the nonprofits that deliver them but today I'm going to focus on one important prong of our
immigrant support programs improving language access asian-americans have the highest rates of limited English
language proficiency in the city at 44% meaning nearly 1 in two Asian New
Yorkers face language barriers that limit their access to government services employment education and civic
participation as part of this work AF is a proud member of the Language Justice Collaborative along with African
Communities Together MASA NYIC Hope and IR which in 2017 helped pass local law
30 requiring New York City agencies to implement language access plans the implementation of that law has seen
agencies rely on poor quality machine translations that at times turn out nonsense translations and on unreliable
third-party teleservices like Language Line in fiscal year 25 city council allocated $3.8 million that allowed us
as a coalition to develop worker cooperatives of translators and interpreters as well as a community interpreter bank using this year's
funding AAF worked with our member organizations to recruit community members to serve as Asian language
interpreters we received over 160 applications and through rounds of screening we are now working with a
group of 16 immigrants who are fluent in the top Asian languages in New York City arabic Bengali Chinese both Cantonese
and Mandarin Korean and Erdo who are training as community interpreters and will go on to build a workerowned
cooperative these interpreters alongside translators from other immigrant communities served by LJC will be poised
to fill the critical need for highquality interpretation for NYC area government nonprofits schools hospitals
and the private sector while also providing opportunities for income and business ownership for the same immigrant communities that need them the
funding that we are requesting from council would allow us to continue building the cooperative with our trainees who will begin providing
services within FY26 and launch fully by the start of FY27 we applaud the
council's support this year and urge you to again support funding for this initiative in FY26 budget to ensure
continuity for these programs that are already in progress thank you again for the opportunity to testify and more
information on our immigrant rapid response programming can be found in our written testimony
thank you good afternoon chairs and council
members my name is Maline Bravo and I am the legal services coordinator at La Cormena we are a immigrant right
organization based in San Island and our mission is to empower the immigrant community through education culture
organizing and economic development for years La Cora has stood unapologetically
with our immigrant community often facing hostility and resistance however
we always remain dedicated because we know how critical this work is we've built a sanctuary of support resilience
and empowerment but we cannot do it alone today I am here to remind you of
the vital importance of ensuring that La Cora continues to receive the unwavering
support it needs from this council now more than ever as we navigate a
fastchanging policy environment we have been equipping our community members
with tools to navigate ICE interactions and preparing them with the power of attorney in case of deportation
proceedings but this is just the beginning our immigrant neighbors face not only the threat of deportation but
also wage theft discrimination and harassment this is why we ask to please
include us along with our partners in the day laborer coalition and the New York City coalition for domestic workers
so we can continue doing this important work we've also had to ramp up security at our own facility as we face
opposition from those who disagree with the work we do on Staten Island it is not easy to operate under these
conditions but we refuse to back down this is why laa exists to remind every
immigrant on Stan Island that they are not alone we are here to fight for them stand with them and uplift them however
to continue this critical mission we need your partnership and your commitment in supporting La Cora thank
you for your time your support and for standing with us as we continue this fight for justice and dignity for all
together we can build a strong and more inclusive Staten Island thank you thank you all very much

two years ago with a hope of finding stability opportunities and a dignified life for my family but instead I found a
reality of exploitation and abuse

humiliations for being lat Latin American they would call us dogs lazy
and they even told us I wish that they wish they deported us all Latins they
denied us water we didn't have time to eat and we worked day long journeys
without payment or extra hours and the worst that they never paid me what was corresponded to me
[Music]

made the complaint with the police and I have proof of everything
and thanks to the labor project uh labor justice project I didn't face this alone

thank you for listening to our stories and for considering our call and for justice and fun and funding thank you
good afternoon members of city council my name is Mohamad Dubaldi and I am a proud
delivery worker here in New York i have been riding since last year rain and
shine to make sure people get their meal and medicine often putting my own safety
at risk but now instead of being recognized and protected I feel targeted
in the in the past few weeks I've been seeing dozen of fellow delivery worker
many of them immigrant like me receive a criminal summones just for doing their
job they are not violent crime they are a ticket for riding ebikes often because
we don't know the exact rule or because we simply can afford to say no to the
short time of the app company give us to deliver the food these ticket cost us
time money in some cases they threaten our ability to stay in this country we
not criminal we workers we don't need moral policy what we really need is
education safe infrastructure and access to the tools that allow us to do our job safely and
legally right now in extremely difficult for many of us to even find
certified ebike that meet the city standards and the cost is out of reach
we ride 6 to 10 hours a day but we don't have places to rest to char to charge
our batteries or even to use bathroom that's why the delivery hub is so
important it's a space designed with our safety and dignity in mind the worker
justice project has proposed a fruitful plan to invest
thousand 100,000 street safety education case management and support for the
implementation of the delivery hub please don't use the city budget to
criminalize us use it to educate us use it to support us use it to make the city
safe safer for everyone riders and pedestrian alike we are not asking much
for much we are just asking to be treated with fairness dignity and with
respect that every essential worker deserve thank you for your time and for
listening to those of us who keep this city moving thank you
start
good afternoon my name is Alejandro Graales i'm a delivery worker and an organizer with the workers justice
project where I lead the work on wage theft and labor abuse today we heard the testimonies of three immigrant workers
who bravely shared their experiences extreme work hours threats stolen wages illness and fear but we also heard
something else thanks to the support of the Workers Justice Project they are now standing tall organized and fighting for
justice
julisa who couldn't speak today but has a message for us reports an abusive employer and received deferred action
just like over a hundred other workers rodulfo is working with the Department of Labor on a retaliation case and is
waiting for certification for a U visa and Jose who after more than three
decades in this country and being affected by 911 by 911 finally has
immigration protections none of these achievements would have been possible without the relentless support and work
of our organization
i speak not only as an organizer i also speak as a worker i know what it's like to work in the rain in the cold or under
fear or fear of being robbed getting into an accident being unfairly deactivated or not making it home that's
why I'm here because we know this fight is collective and it goes beyond ourselves
fundamentalist that's why I urgently ask you today secure the necessary funding for the workers justice program to
continue operating and growing we need your support to sustain these four essential programs $100,000 for safety
education and training program for delivery workers $250,000 for support for lowincome
workers 95,000 for worker cooperative development initiative 150,000 for support
initiative for women and immigrant workers
without these resources we won't be able to continue supporting the most vulnerable workers of our city today we
face enormous challenges labor abuse racism violence and misinformation it is precisely in times like these when we
most need your support because when a worker res recovers stolen wages or a delivery worker learns that they have
rights it's not just one person who wins it's the whole city thank you very
much good afternoon Chair Ables and members of the committee my name is
Arari Perez and I'm a program director of workers justice project i'm honored
to speak today on behalf of WJP members who are delivery workers day laborers
and domestic workers people who have who are work keeps this city alive every
single day i've seen fires hand the struggles our members face a stolen wage
unsafe jobs and now something even more frightening they are being criminalized
by the NYPD just for doing their jobs these essential workers risk their
health and safety to keep New Yorkers fit and cared for but instead of
protection they life in daily fear fear of
immigration rate rates at court at work even in their own neighborhoods this
fear is real and it tears family apart at workers justice project we stand
alongside our members we help them secure fair wage fair working conditions
and dignity we work with city agencies to provide the services they desperately
need but now under day NYPD and NYC mayor's adult policy delivery workers
are being targeted with criminal summ into a confusing criminal system
with little to no support it's heartbreaking no witness for five years
we have received no new fundings even as demand grows we've stretched every
dollars to the limit doing everything we can to support newly arrived immigrants
and delivery workers but the needs are overwhelming and without new resources
we cannot protect this community today I ask you to stand with us support this
vital programs that mean the the word to our members um
$200,000 for protect NYC immigrant families helping immigrant workers fight
back against informments 100,000 for citywide deliverist outreach
and safety training hang on hang on we need to get quiet in the chamber please while people are testifying
thank you thank you
$4,97,000 for the day labor workforce initiative a coalition that supports
every single uh worker in the day labor centers connecting workers with living
wage jobs and trainings $115,000 for OSHA 30 construction safety
trainings ensuring immigrant workers can work safely and $10,000 in discretionary
funding supporting every from job training to healthcare access this
dollar represents more than programs they represent hope dignity and the chance for better life for thousand of
workers who make this city round together we can build a new New York and
these values that uh protects uh all the city and all our workers thank you for
listening and for your support thank you all very much thank you
okay next we have uh Nibilia Coyote
thank you good afternoon Chair Abilles Chair Rana and members of the city council immigration and finance committees and fellow New Yorkers my
name is Na Coyote i am the executive director of NY's new immigrant community empowerment a community based
organization in Queens that is dedicated to nurturing the spirit of all immigrants and supporting the power and
potential of immigrant workers new New Yorkers and long-standing members of our city who are too often left behind i am
here today to speak about the essential role of our pre-apprenticeship for life and work program and to urge the city to
continue and straighten its commitment to organizations like NICE through stable and timely contract funding
particularly the workforce development initiatives such as the day labor workforce initiative immigrant gender
equity construction site safety initiative adult literacy pilot project welcome NYC and legal services such as
lowwage worker support among many others our pre-apprenticeship for life and work
provides immigrant New Yorkers with what they need most real access to opportunity we prepare individual most
of them low-wage workers and often excluded from traditional workforce systems for union apprenticeship skill
certifications and career pathways in growing industries like a structure green jobs and building maintenance we
do this in a cultural responsive linguistically appropriate and worker centered way but this program is not
just about skills it's about dignity mobility and survival every week I meet with participants who are navigating
multiple barriers language immigration status lack of health health services
options discrimination and economic hardship there are newly arrived immigrants day laborers domestic workers
and job seekers people who keep the city running but who are constantly fighting to stay afloat because beyond beyond job
training we equip our participants with critical life skills that are essential for surviving and thriving in the city
these are the things that we don't talk about yet that determine whether a person can fully participate in society
understanding how to navigate the transportation system access health services and insurance manage finances
and open a bank account etc in addition to workforce and life skills
development NICE provides critical legal education and support services to help our community members navigate an
increasing an increasingly hostile environment every day we offer no your rights workshops to ensure immigrants
understand the protection under labor immigration and criminal justice systems
these sessions are not theorical they are tools for survival whether is a worker facing wage staff of someone
targeted by immigration enforcement our legal empowerment works helps them recognize abuse assert their rights and
access support in this moment when immigrant communities are under extreme harm um these legal services are
essential to protect lives prevent exploitation and build collective power for them NICE is a lifeline and
the pre-operative for life and work is often their first step toward a more stable future
we are deeply proud of our of the impact of our program however I must be honest our ability to continue delivering these
results is under threat we call on the city council to ensure full and continue
funding for immigrant service workforce programs language access welcome welcoming new immigrants legal services
health services etc in total over 1 million for NICE in different awards
expedite reimbursements and budget approvals so that nonprofits are not forced to carry the cost of city
services and center immigrant and worker-led organizations in the design and funding of workforce development
initiatives particularly those that serve undocumented and lowincome New Yorkers on behalf of NICE and the
immigrant workers we serve I thank you for your time and your leadership gracias
thank you for your testimony okay now we have
uh Paulina Cohen Scarlett
Thompson Paula Inaru Natalia from Make the Road Timothy
Sheen Julian Cologne and Jing Willie
group are you
okay so hang back and we'll call you up together
okay good afternoon to uh Chair Ailas and all the council members present my name is Natalia Sawal and I'm testifying
and I'm deputy director of McDero New York and I'm testifying on behalf of our 28,000 plus members um my written
testimony is longer and I actually was going to start with some of the work that we're doing but I want to start our
um verbal testimony talking specifically about the student Dylan who was picked up in the Bronx and it's important to
highlight this case because Dylan did not have any criminal record he um did the process for asylum at the border and
he is or he was in a current process and he decided with his lawyer that he
should show up to his immigration case what we saw in Dylan case is two things a practice that we're seeing now from
immigration where they're dismissing an immigration case so that ICE can pick up the person outside and a lot of these
people actually get represented by the rapid response initiative which currently this year we're asking for 25
million for legal representation including a restoration of 600,000 that was taken away last year
and I'm highlighting this is because these cases were we're seeing them more and more where ICE just only wants to
pick up people um who are brown and it doesn't matter what immigration case people have and it's really unfort
unfortunate to see a student get picked up um and both the DOE and the mo and the mayor's office of immigrant affairs
should be doing more um to help in his case we additionally also want to baseline um baseline the current funding
of 1.6 million we want to invest 55 million in immigration legal services to expand access to representation and
increase in baseline 40 million for the immigrant opportunity initiative and renew the protect New York families
initiative to support immigrant New Yorkers um additionally we're asking to fully fund the department of consumer
worker protections at 2.5 million for workers rights enforcement to ensure um
that uh the new minimum pay rule for delivery workers and more um we expand
the low-wage worker support initiative to three million so we can help immigrant workers fight stolen wages and
learn their rights and restore the commission on human rights um I want to highlight just to quickly education
programs we want to make sure that there is double baseline funding for DYCD funding adult literacy programs from 12
to 24 million to maintain adult literacy discretionary funding at 16.5 million
including the adult literacy uh pilot and we want to we're grateful that that
14 million was included in the executive budget for community schools we still need 3.3 million for student success
centers 12 million for restorative justice and last but not least we can stop using um some of the money uh to
have safety agents or NYPD in schools since students don't feel safe anymore
with NYPD in their schools thank you
good afternoon everyone um it's good to see some of you from the preliminary hearings and I know it's been a long day
of testimony so I appreciate your your commitment i'm Paulina Cohen i'm a staff attorney at the New York City
Antiviolence Project um you heard from a lot of great legal service providers that are doing a lot of great
immigration work but I'm here to talk about AP which has long been at the forefront of New York's fight against
hate and oppression our crisis hotline is open 24 hours a day and we offer critical support to LGBTQ and immigrant
communities including clients in all of your districts so I want to thank you for your ongoing support it's becoming
harder for LGBTQ and immigrant New Yorkers to access justice and safety and there's no guarantee of legal
representation in the immigration system which leaves thousands to face serious legal and human rights challenges all
alone we at AP however are committed um to serving the most vulnerable and we
recognize the council's commitment to protecting immigrants we recently filed an amicus brief supporting your lawsuit
against the mayor's office for allowing ICE at Rikers and I'm here to ask you to help complete this puzzle by ensuring
sustained and increased funding for immigration legal services ap is the only LGBTQ specific victim services
agency in the city we provide culturally competent legal services including including humanitarian immigration
relief alongside holistic support we do outreach to ensure survivors know about and can access our services and we
advocate on a broader scale like by filing the amicus in your case to lift up the issues our clients face i want to
tell you quickly about one of my clients i'm going to call her Daisy daisy came to us with a with a really complex
immigration case her case had been bouncing between the immigration agencies and immigration courts and she
didn't have a clear grasp on the status of her application with ambiguity leaving her
vulnerable to wrongful apprehension by immigration authorities we intervened filed the right motions got her asylum
application properly filed and she was also able to finally get her work permit which was years overdue thanks to AP's
continued support Daisy now has clear legal status and the ability to work which gives her which allows her to
continue the positive life she's building here in New York daisy is just one of many in fiscal year 24 ABP's
legal department handled over 280 cases nearly 70% immigration related this need
is growing especially among our transgender clients who have been specifically targeted by hateful federal
policies we fill critical service gaps where the city resources fall short and
our collocation model connects legal and social services helping survivors holistically rebuild their lives with
your support we can expand that work especially in light of cuts to our federal funding funding from you all
will allow us to provide direct services outreach and advocacy that are all really essential in this acute moment of
crisis simply put without your help we cannot continue to keep our communities safe
ap is committed to ensuring that our community members have access to justice and safety and I'm asking this committee
to show that same dedication thank you for your ongoing support and for the opportunity to testify
good afternoon Cherilus and distinguished members of the New York City Council Committee my name is Julian
Kolong and I'm a literacy program coordinator and ESOL teacher at the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park
also known as CFL i'm here today to call on city council to maintain the full
amount of $16.5 million of discretionary funding for adult literacy initiative
and adult literacy pilot project over the past four years serving the immigrant community of New York City has
been an honor and a privilege i've been fortunate enough to have the hardest working most dedicated students in my
classroom whether to pursue new professional ventures return to school and complete a degree prepare for the
citizenship exam or simply develop better communication skills to connect with their children the individuals who
have gathered at CFL all arrive with a drive and sense of perseverance that is nothing short of
inspiring eager to learn and share their culture and experiences these students continue to inspire me on a daily basis
and inform my teaching they remind me every day why I do what I
do and that it is never too late to pursue your dreams regardless of who you are or where you come from we are truly
grateful that the New York City Council provided us with the necessary resources to rescue our ESOL program after a 24%
reduction of DYCD's adult literacy program from their previous procurement
as Sunset Park has the third highest concentration of individuals with limited English language proficiency in
New York City your support has allowed me to continue classes in our high need
area this need hasn't gone away we estimate that our ESOL waiting list is
in the thousands and interest has remained steady even in the face of xenophobic federal policies thank you
for partnering with us in this fight to protect adult education classes such as mine that take place across the city
each day that enrich educate and nurture those seeking a better life in the United States those of us within the
field of language education particularly within the nonprofit sector view language education not as a commodity
but as an essential service that should be available to all with your efforts we can continue to provide these services
to those who need them the most who would otherwise not have access to such resources nor the opportunity to realize
their full potential thank you
good afternoon Chair Azair Brennan and distinguished members of the council
committees i'm Tim Sheen and I'm chair of the board of the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park and I'm joining
Julian here today and others to urge the city council to protect our immigrant community by maintaining the full 16.5
million in discretionary funding for the adult literacy initiative and the adult
literacy pilot project through discretionary funding our ESL
ESO program offered at no cost enables New Yorkers with limited English proficiency to begin their journey
toward dignified working conditions improved pay increased access to public benefits and a greater sense of
belonging in our neighborhood a worthy investment a recent report from the
United Neighborhood Houses highlights the positive impact economic and social
impacts of investment in our community members through adult literacy programs
for example the first randomized evaluation of a publicly funded ESOL
course in Massachusetts published in the journal Economic Policy found that those who
participated increased annual earnings by 56% in Sunset Park this is
seen through the story of Raul a student at CFL with an unwavering commitment to
learning who day after day took risks learned skills and gained confidence in
his abilities to to communicate in English through his own initiative our
classes propelled him to prepare for and enroll in community college where he is
now pursuing his passion for chemistry with the goal of becoming a pharmacist
with the support of the city council in FY25 75% of our program participants
showed improvement in their English proficiency leading to outcome outcomes like our rules that can support working
families and strengthen our community but I want to say that these
benefits go beyond the individual the economic and social benefits of ESOL
programs redown to the city's economy and to the city's fiscal u to the city's
fisk i'm glad that uh chairman Brandon is here to hear this so in the
Massachusetts study they found that the increase in earnings over time this 56%
of the individuals increase in earnings over time paid for the cost of the
program and actually generated a 6% return to taxpayers an earlier study
called Eager for English a report that was prepared by firm Apple Seed for the
New York Immigration Coalition in 2004 showed that increasing the supply of ESO
ESOL classes in New York City would more than pay for itself by increasing the
skill level of program participants thereby their total economic impact it provided it would
provide a net increase to New York City and New York state taxes so these programs beyond their social benefits
can be looked on as economic development programs and probably have a bigger bang for the buck than any other economic
development program you might consider so um ideally our ESOL program would be
supported by a robust baseline uh budget managed by DYCD with continue
with stable year-over-year funding however until DIYCD revises its policies
it is crucial that the New York City Council continues its support to ensure that adult learners continue to have
access to the pathways they need to thrive thank you very much for your consideration
good afternoon thank you to Chairless Chair Brandon and members of the immigration and finance committee for
the opportunity to testify my name is Jimn Wii and I'm a student from the New York High School as part of the youth
advocate team at the Chinese American Planning Council when I first arrived in America
I was very afraid to admit that I was from Venezuela there was a pervasive discrimination towards people like me
and I grew up being bullied i was afraid that if anyone knew who or where I came from they looked at me differently and
reject me when I came in touch with CBC I slowly found my own values and was accepted into this community
obtain opportunities and achieve things that I never thought I would be able to accomplish i was able to get my first
job as a supervisor where I was able to oversee and manage more than 30 workers in this community and through
these experience that CBC has offered me i learned to truly appreciate who I am and where and I'm here to proudly tell
you where I came from in light of federal threats our city must live up to its values and
adopt a budget that meets the growing needs of working-class and immigrant New Yorkers we need to fully fund the social
safety net which includes the service and programming provided by organizations like CBC
we're also urging to expand access to support services such as housing vouchers to all New Yorkers regardless
of immigration status to increase investment in Promise NYC and allocate
additional funds for adult literacy to meet the needs of our newest New Yorkers investments such as these will
enable all families to improve their economic prospect more fully integrate into their communities and thrive thank
you so much for the opportunity to testify on issues that really impact our communities
uh thank you so much uh obviously to this entire um panel and I have to give a special shout out to my CFO and CPC
colleagues to all of y'all um I just wanted to underscore the thank
you for pointing out obviously the probably very minimum return on investment that we get from adult
literacy it is confounding to me that our city has not seen the multiple uh
the multiplication benefit of this service for so long and has been like
defunding it for so long so we're going to continue to fight to expand literacy funding because it is absolutely
critical to our organizations to our communities to our city so thank you so
much thank you for your continued support thank you all very much
okay next panel we have Zachary Katz
Nelson Megan French Marcelin Serita Daftani Jennifer Parish
Roberto
Pon what
there's
want to begin from your left sure thank you so much uh good afternoon i'm Zachary Katz Nelson i'm the executive
director of the Independent Rikers Commission thank you for the chance to testify today uh I want to first thank
the council for its continued uh support and and push for the investments that discussed in its press release this
morning investments to address mental illness to address recidivism and re-entry investments that are critical
to public safety to closing Rikers and to ultimately saving this city money
they are pennies on the dollar compared to Rikers but the return will be tremendous as opposed to Rikers itself
which it's hard to imagine a worse investment this city can make than continue to pour money into Riker's Island i want to touch on two things
based on the Department of Corrections testimony today uh department of corrections said it had that the state
commission on correction has done a staffing analysis of one jail on Riker there are eight open jails on Rikers so
what would happen if the state commission or somebody else actually analyzed the staffing at all eight jails
on Riker's Island what would that budget look like as compared to what we have today you know notably when the the DOC
said the state commission looked at the Belleview outposted units it found that many fewer officers were needed than the
Department of Corrections said so the the council could require the Department of Correction to do a departmentwide
analysis both civilian and uniform staff and then produce a budget that actually matches the true need whatever that
turns out to be secondly re-entry you know time and again we hear about people
who are released from Rikers people who are getting treatment inside mental mental health or addiction treatment who
are not properly connected with service providers on the outside that is missed opportunity after missed opportunity
it's no wonder that a third of people who are released from Rikers every year are back there within a year why don't
we set up a system when somebody is going to be released that the service providers on the outside who are meant
to help them continue their drug treatment for instance they get noticed that it's going to happen we have a system right now to service providers
when people are arrested why don't we tell them when people are due to be released so we don't miss yet another opportunity thank you so much
good afternoon chair Brandon chair nurse chair um I am Sita i'm co-director of
freedom agenda we're one of the organizations leading the campaign to close Rikers our members have
experienced Rikers and been impacted by crime and they know what works to create public safety things like housing
healthcare work opportunities and mentorship while Mayor Adams has said he wants to close the pipelines that feed
Rikers his budget would leave gaping holes in our city's mental health infrastructure and social safety net
continuing to funnel vulnerable New Yorkers into Riker's Island where they are subjected to violence deadlocking sexual assault now also potential being
picked off by ICE uh we we're calling on the city council to ensure that the adopted budget paves the way for New
York City to close Riker's Island and we appreciate the emphasis that the council has already put on those investments one
important uh tool we want to point out to you or uh is the possibility to reallocate $150 million that the that
the city is currently planning to spend to hire,00 more correction officers instead of spending money on those
additional officers uh we should be spending we should invest be investing to help New Yorkers thrive that includes
70.6 million more to meet critical mental health and housing needs 2.4 million more is for for alternatives to
incarceration and re-entry programs 8.1 million more for the board of correction to adequately conduct their oversight
and $3 million to begin a master plan for renewable Rikers doc spending is such an epic scandal that it's sometimes
hard to put into context honestly this is an agency that a federal judge has described as both overstaffed and
underserved while OM has pushed for vacancy reductions at agencies that provide vital services to improve
people's lives DOC has escaped even the suggestion of such cuts despite their vacancy rate growing for three years
straight why is this special treatment being given to the one agency in the city that is actually required to shrink
in the next few years under the plan to close Rikers when the Independent Rikers Commission estimates that the burough
jails will require only 3,240 uniformed officers at most why is DOC budgeting
for 7,60 which is,00 more than their current headcount um DOC has pitched
hiring staff more staff as a way to curb excessive overtime ibo published a report that shows that's not the case um
just to wrap up we're grateful that the council in your budget response is aligned with us and so many New Yorkers and calling for investments in mental
health at a scale that finally reaches the need and we know what OM is going to tell you they're going to say there's no money for that um so we need the council
to be prepared to say there's $150 million in this budget to hire,00
unnecessary correction officers and we need this administration to get their priorities straight i'll submit along
with this a full analysis um of the budget that outlines our investment priorities thank you
hi good afternoon my name is Jennifer Parish i'm the director of criminal justice advocacy at the Urban Justice
Center Mental Health Project uh thank you for this opportunity to testify and for all the that the council has done
related to closing Rikers i'm here today to express our opposition to the Department of Corrections exorbitant
budget and urge the council to reallocate a portion of that agency's $1.2 billion budget in a way that
actually benefits our community and reduces incarceration those are investments that will improve public
safety and advance the plan to close Rikers the Department of Correction has demonstrated to you time and time again
that it's incapable of fulfilling its fundamental obligation to keep people in its custody safe and healthy just two
weeks ago in the class action Nunes versus Department of Correction Chief US
District Judge Laura Swain issued a decision finding it necessary to appoint a remediation manager this is an
individual outside of the department independent of city hall to protect the constitutional rights of incarcerated
people and reduce y violence this decision came after years actually nine years of being monitored nine years of
failing to um comply with the consent judgment um and multiple remedial orders
the judge identified 18 uh core provisions that the city was in contempt of but what the court did not find was
that the department was understaffed she said that the department has enormous resources which are not being
effectively deployed and she specifically described it as overstaffed so the city must stop pouring money into
the dysfunctional department of correction and that should be done in this year's budget they have allocated
far too much money for uniform staffed 7,060 officers and that's not going to
happen it's not going to be filled there are,00 vacancies and you heard this
morning that they testified there's a small number of recruits joining the department and a significant number of
staff that are going to retire um we support all of the uh budget allocations
that are included in the campaign to close Riker's um analysis of the budget and we hope that you'll fund them
instead of the department of correction
thank you to the city council um Chair Aulas and the committee on immigration for your attention and commitment to
supporting uh New York City's immigrant community in the 2026 fiscal budget cycle my name is Roberto Pon community
engagement associate for Hobbre Kitchen and I'm testifying today on behalf of Hobbre Kitchen an organization that
creates economic opportunity through job skills training food entrepreneurship and an ecosystem of support for
individuals who face barriers to meaningful careers um this year we will continue our efforts to provide
workforce training for New York's asylum seeking population over the past 17 years Habre Kitchen has enrolled over
2,000 program participants into our programs to help them launch careers in the food industry start and grow their
small business and access the resources they need to succeed at work and in the world our community includes residents
of 50 city council districts 91% of our members identify as people of color with
86% identifying as women just over half our members across our programs were born outside of the US and are
non-native English speakers with approximately 82% of our members unemployed before starting one of our
programs they've reached starting wages postgraduation of about 18 to $22 an
hour our members are dedicated hardworking New Yorkers seeking opportunities for meaningful careers
sustainable income and long-term wealth generation for their families um we offer our members several programs
to reach economic mobility including culinary career pathways for New Yorkers
we provide uh wraparound support case management referrals to our 200 plus
community- based organizations to access child care vouchers affordable housing mental health services we provide Metro
cards stipens and job placement to our network of employer partners um we're very grateful to have received funding
from the city council which has supported our growing number of enrolled members and our expansion of offerings
into other bureaus including Bronx Brooklyn and Queens with the council's investment we have surpassed our
three-year strategic growth uh goal of 1,000 bread winners strong by 2000 we
are renewing our efforts to seek the council support for culinary career pathways for New Yorkers in fiscal year
26 specifically for the continuation of this needed program and ask for your support for 100,000 welcome New York
City initiative funding some support for women immigrant u workers initiative requests with the arrival of uh an
unprecedented amount of migrants and asylum seekers in New York City over the past several years um Harbor Kitchen
developed and launched this program by adapting our training to targeted to provide targeted services for this
asylum seeking population in 2025 we graduated one cohort of 24 members and
we just began another one of 25 for both cohorts we have over 500 applications um
um we continue to serve more New Yorkers each year in accessing economic mobility and we respectfully urge the committee
on immigration to support our applications for funding for this vital year thank you for your attention and investment in Hopper Kitchen's work
good afternoon my name is Megan French Marcelen i'm the senior director of New York State Policy at the Legal Action
Center today I testify on behalf of the New York City Alternatives to Incarceration and Re-entry Coalition um
we are a network of 12 service organizations with decades of experience
in providing holistic community-based supports to justice involved New Yorkers
collectively we serve more than 30,000 New Yorkers each year let me start by
just saying Riker has proven to be a terrible and very costly public safety
strategy but our programs are not um these programs are actually some of the
most meaningful mechanisms we have available to envision and scale a more
just justice system um these programs are not just about human potential
however they're also evidence-based effective interventions supported by
decades of research in fact that research has shown us that our programs
are more effective than incarceration at reducing recidivism keeping people from
committing new crimes connecting people to services and keeping people employed
and we actually do this at a cost much cheaper than the Department of Correction
um incarcerating just one person at Riker for a year is over
$500,000 atis create cost savings studies estimate that for every dollar
spent on ATI between $3 and $5 is of
benefits are generated um this year the count the coalition is asking for $2.4
million in additional discretionary funds and to put that into some
perspective that whole ask is just 10% of what the DOC spends monthly on
overtime um if you can read my full written testimony it has examples of
both how we have used discretionary funds in the past and how we plan to use
the additional funding to bring these programs to scale and make sure that all
New Yorkers have access to effective holistic communitydriven supports thank
you
thank you all very much okay our next panel we have Scarlett
Thompson Andrea or Andrea Rodriguez and Jasmine Joseph
okay whoever wants to start good afternoon thank you for the
opportunity to speak here today my name is Scarlett Thompson i use she her pronouns and I am a senior prevention
coordinator at the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault i'm here today to speak with you about an often
missed point when it comes to conversations about criminal justice which is preventing harm before it can
even happen i'm asking you today to commit to investing $300,000 to support
Outsmart NYC a program that focuses specifically on sexual violence
prevention within New York City Nightlife this program is a collaborative effort with the crime
victims treatment center and a collective of people who work in nightlife some of whom have joined me on
this panel today the rates of sexual violence in the US are staggering one in two trans
or gender non-conforming people one in four women and one in six men will
experience sexual violence in their lifetimes last year we conducted a survey of New York City nightlife
workers in which 70% of the nightlife staff who responded said that they
frequently witnessed sexual violence at work and 60% had experienced sexual
violence at work outsmart works to prevent sexual violence by training staff to recognize and intervene in harm
we work with managers and owners on policies and environmental changes that increase safety and providing support
resources to the nightlife community we have trained over 100 venues that range
from small wine bars on the Lower East Side to clubs that host thousands of people a night in Bushwick we also
provide safety advocacy for massive events like Red Bull's Culture Clash event last year and Pride events
throughout June our team here at Outsmart has been working tirelessly to support patrons and staff for over 10
years now and we know how much further our reach could go if the city council allotted the $300,000 we are requesting
even without the staffing we need to conduct outreach the demand for our programming far outstrips our current
staff capacity to meet it i implore you to invest in community- based safety efforts led by and for the people who
make up the heart of New York City
nightife um good afternoon and thank you for allowing us to speak today uh my name is
Jasmine Joseph and I work for Outsmart as their administrative associate and
social media manager however I've also been working as a professional DJ in New
York City Nightlife for over 10 years i also currently work as a DJ in New York City Nightlife in addition to my role at
Outsmart um this allows me to do several things for one I can bring back
experiences that I'm having uh in my work as a DJ back to the Outsmart team
uh which they use to help make their curriculum and trainings their bystander intervention trainings which we offer to
New York City nightlife venues as relevant as possible um I'm also tapped
into the New York City nightife community uh specifically New York City nightlife workers and performers as
somebody who's been dejing in New York City nightife for over 10 years and I hear a lot of things through word of mouth scarlet shared with you stats and
stats are great however sexual violence is seriously under reportported
especially in the New York City nightlife community where a lot of things that we experience our jobs and
income depend on our us being able to tolerate it uh in so many words um and
so I am able to bring back a lot of things that I'm hearing through word of mouth from my community to the outsmart
team and they're able to apply the things that I'm bringing back to them to help tailor their trainings um and to
help make New York City nightlife community comfortable with us when we come in because there are nightlife
workers on the staff who can speak their language with them um additionally I
just want to say that prior to being a DJ I was simply a patron i am a native
New Yorker and I love this city new York City nightife is a huge part of the
social fabric of this city and I really truly believe after the past three years of working with outsmart that uh the
work that they do is incredibly impactful and I really think that the funding would help us to expand our
reach outside of Brooklyn Manhattan where we're most active to burrows like Bronx and Queens and also upper
Manhattan Harlem where we're really looking to target um so thanks again for
allowing me to speak hi everyone my name is Andrea and I
started with smart in May of 2023 as the health equity and life leazison um I'm
also a patron of nightlife and I also perform harm reduction for night life um and as a child of immigrant I understand
this the importance of spaces for joy dance and also the importance of immigrants in night life community as a
queer person nightlife has been a lifeline new York has always been a cultural epicenter for the world and so
much of that culture comes from night life what I've come to understand is that night life is neutral she has and
will always be there for all of us to celebrate to grief to create work
inspire and heal this spaces where many of us can finally decompress and take off the mask we've been wearing all day
and sometimes all of our lives i believe that everyone deserves to return home not safe but well
also goes beyond safety it's about the well-being of everyone and every
stakeholder in the room we meet we meet businesses where they're at we do not signal v virtue we tailor our workshops
to reflect our the culture of each venue the people who work there and the communities they serve without
compromising our values and principles we also take the history and context of night seriously last year we brought
together a group of trans life trans nightlife workers who designed a training specifically to center the
well-being of trans and gender non-conforming people this community is not only at higher risk and also and
also has and will always shape so much of nightlife culture in New York and around the world the training piloted at
Elsewhere in Brooklyn included a framework from one facilitator's PhD research it focused on a spectrum of
safety for trans people from the absence of harm to the presence of celebration and belonging it helped staff understand
how part of uh how every part of a venue including how security checks are done can be made more
affirming we ask we are asking for your support so we can continue to support New Yorkers we're also working in
language accessibility as immigrants uh and nightife workers are facing unprecedented unprecedented times uh and
becoming more at risk we offer drug workshops right now um and information in English and Spanish at this time uh
we are asking for your support so we can continue supporting New Yorkers and if you want to know how health of how
healthy a city is look at its night life and for many of us a DJ really did save
our lives thank you thank you thanks for all you guys do thank you thank you
okay this is our final in-person panel before Sandy turns into a pumpkin um we
have Kate Tiscus Yankee Taring Natali Aril Ardilia Richard
Flores and Raul Rivera
you want to begin go ahead um thank you so much for holding this hearing today
uh I wanted to talk a little bit about programs that the council is already supporting that really help make sure
that folks who are justice impacted and people who are immigrants are able to get the services that they need um which
is becoming even more important as demands on them are made worse and worse
by the federal administration uh first there's a bunch of really great workforce development programs that the
council supports pride at work uh works with LGBT people who are justiceimpacted
LGBT people who are who are um without homes people all over the map and it's
actually the nation's first and only uh publicly funded partnership between
union high road employment and queer organizations it's working like a charm one of the organizations in it has
literally 100% employment placement which in this economy is crazy um also the domestic workers empowerment
initiative and the workers cooperative business development initiative both focus on making sure people who might
not have their documents totally in order are able to have safe dignified
access to workplaces but also to understand and know the rights that city
council has worked really hard to pass for them uh the city council's human rights law work for domestic workers is
first in the nation and in order to be able to use that law domestic workers got to know about it which is what the
domestic workers empowerment initiative does um sort of breezing on to folks who are
especially justice impacted support for persons in the sex trades is really kind of hitting all over the map in terms of
providing support for people who are coming into the city who are sort of finding that is their first place uh
where they're needing to seek employment making sure that they can get access to city services and go about their
business safely is so important and that initiative is asking for an increase to 7.4 million and um my wrap-up sentence
is the sexual assault initiative also keeps a close eye on folks who are
justice impacted um it's the city council not the mayor not the state only
the city council funds the sexual assault initiative so thank you for your work with that as well
can you hear me yeah oh good afternoon and you know thank you for your patience i was concerned that after a certain
point we would be asked to leave so anyway um thank you to all the members of the committee on immigration my name
is Yangi Sharing i'm the executive director of a company capital we're a CDFI a community development um
financial institution and what we do is we focus on providing access to affordable credit financial education
and training uh the loans we provide range from a th00and to 350,000 so very
very numerous micro entrepreneurs and then going up to working with small
businesses uh since our founding we have expanded economic opportunities
primarily for immigrants refugees underserved entrepreneurs and we've dispersed over 68 million in business
loans uh created 10,000 unique uh 3,000 new jobs and worked with over 10,000
unique businesses and saved more than 11,000 jobs uh citywide so while our
mission is to create pathways to prosperity for micro and small businesses um their very presence in the
city is being threatened by recent executive orders as we're all aware and
obviously a lot of the federal funding that we had access to has been decreased
or is under threat of being eliminated um last year we served clients from over
57 countries uh we want to thank city council for the recent creation of the
CDFI initiative and through this funding our team has already supported 25
businesses we're on track to serve 40 over 40 businesses and these are
businesses that would not qualify for services with the funding we currently
have so these are street vendors cleaning services and catering businesses
up so uh we are fully aware that there will be further decreases restrictions
we have a proposal pending for the CDFI initiative to continue our existing
partnership with Asian-Americans for equality and business outreach center to
create economic opportunity for over 250 entrepreneurs who currently do not
qualify to get services with the current funding we have we have a grant of
request of 330,000 pending we strongly encourage you to keep in mind all the
risk facing immigrant refugee in the small business communities these businesses need support thank you for
your time and on behalf of everyone at a company capital we look forward to strengthening and partnering with the
other organizations that are represented here thank you thank you very much go ahead sir
council me council member Brennan thanks for giving me the opportunity to
testify i've listened to testimony protecting the rights of
illegals and migrants at this hearing including those who are living and
working in New York City those who haven't been
deported or those who haven't been imprisoned as a result of
committing crime the reason why I'm mentioning
this is yesterday Memorial Day I was physically and sexually
attacked for being a cisgender male and I was sitting at a public area outside
the offices of 17 State Street which is in the financial district
i was formerly employed there for a company called Shareholders
Communications and I was a CSR there from 1994 to 1998 till 2001 in 2001 I
witnessed the attacks on the World Trade Center on 911 i was employed there and I
saw unfortunately the events unfold so I was sitting there for various
reasons and one of the reasons was thinking about my past and the fact that
I was formerly employed there and thinking about my present and what was actually occurring and being that
yesterday was Memorial Day it's something that carries a lot of weight in most Americans minds including my
own now the reason why I'm mentioning this is because and I apologize if it
sounds a bit uh far-fetched I heard an individual who
works as an information agent and another individual who works as a security guard
say various times that uh I would be
attacked for being a cisgender male and I didn't quite understand this there's a lot of racial bias going on there's a
lot of hate crimes going on in New York i've seen many things happen and I unfortunately I've been attacked many
times on on the street uh for the last 10 years i've gone to the police i've
spoken to the DOI i've spoken to uh Joselyn Strober uh inspectors at the DOI
etc over and over again for the last almost 10 years now and I have
documented proof if you need it uh and so I'm mentioning this at this
testimonial to address the fact that uh what I still call the prison industrial
complex being funded by legislation I believe is using
collisional data and information that is being used to provide that funding and
what is not being said at this hearing are the other important factors that are affecting every American's rights
including illegals including migrants who want to become American citizens sir could you please wrap up your testimony
sure and and live in this country so I can't go into the
rest what is troubling me is that is this how the American economy is being
run meaning this is how we're funding the prison industrial complex i
believe that a lot of the violence that is occurring in this country uh is not being handled properly a lot
of what I heard today the testimony that I heard today and the people who are trying to protect the rights of illegals
and migrants I understand but the climate of violence and fear that is
currently plaguing our country is quite another thing up your testimony you're now over time and just out of respect
for other people waiting online as well you can submit any written testimony to
um the gentleman in the back okay all I'd like to say in closing is that I truly believe that needs there needs to
be relegation of the law in order for that funding to be used properly great thank you thank you for your testimony
go ahead sir uh good afternoon my name is Row Vera uh I just want to say before
I read my statement that uh we don't trust the G the NOS's the
nonprofits there's something that's going on with all this money being handing out to uh
immigrants uh the city has spent $6.9 billion and you cannot help immigrants
with $6.9 billion that's very suspect i think uh somebody should look into that
also the chair Az is in the back i'm not sure why she doesn't want to sit down at the chair and and take over her uh her
chair she's You have two minutes look at what she's doing you call you call you call that representation this is coming
out of your two minutes yeah but you you you call that representation right well I'm going to Yeah you could look up for
that $1 billion that's missing on the Thrive NYC that uh we we spoke about you know I asked you to investigate that
that's $1 billion so I'm going to read the a quote from Dr wala Sultan
the trouble with Islam is deeply rooted in its teachings islam is also a
politically ideology that I I'll restart the trouble with Islam is deeply rooted
in its teachings islam is also a political ideology that preaches violence and applies its agenda to
agenda by force i'll remind Chair Ailez that it was Muslims who attacked and
brought down the World Trade Centers on 911 i'll also remind the chair Palestinians were dancing in the streets
of Palestine sir I'm going to need you to stay on topic please we're not here to disparage any religious on topic this
is about immigration i reclaim my time chair Az believes there's no reclamation
thank you chair Az believes that the struggle of Puerto Rico and Palestine are the same i remind the chair Puerto
Rico does not hate America like the Palestinians do and Puerto Rico does not have a terrorist organization called
Hamas you support Zan Mandani for NYC who lied to me about publicly denouncing
Hamas Hezbollah and Sharia law his campaign team said on camera that Mr
mandani put out a statement we demand sir this is not on topic and your time is over we demand he produce the so
thank you for your testimony we'll submit our testimony thank you zoom yep okay now we're moving to Zoom
our first uh first for Zoom is Ari
our first on Zoom is Ariaban you may begin
all right hi good evening everyone can you hear me okay yes go ahead all righty so my name is Ayan Omaragban i'm the New
York policy manager at African Communities Together first and foremost I'd like to say good evening uh Chair
Brandon Chair Ailis and members of the committees on finance and immigration this is actually my first time doing a
virtual testimony i tend to be there every time but thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak so I'm here
today to ask city council to renew $7.8 8 million in funding to the language
access grant to expand vital services ranging from legal and rapid response to
critical community education to help New York's immigrants access resources and and protect their rights um I make this
request in hope and also in expectation that the council will grant a complete
restoration of funding for Afringual New York's first and premier African workerowned language collaborative um
just to give you all some statistics uh according to New York statistics there are estimated
172,712 immigrants from subsaharan Africa living in New York State in New
York City alone there are approximately 86,694 speakers of African languages and
tens of thousands of speakers of French and Arabic many of these African language speakers are limited English
proficient and studies show that African immigrants are among New York's most language isolated communities i think my
colleagues who spoke on the panel earlier from Language Justice Collaborative they talked a lot about
the work that we've been able to do over the last few years we advocated for New York City's local law 30 we pushed for
the passage of New York State legislation um New York State language access law um and last year we also
worked together to lead a successful campaign that resulted in the New York City Council making an unprecedented
investment of 3.8 million in building the language access workforce um you
know we since receiving that funding Afrolingual has been able to provide New Yorkers with time has expired okay could
I just finish this sentence and then Sure go ahead sorry about that so afrilingual you know we've been able to
provide New Yorkers with workerowned language access services interpretation translation and English uh as a second
language instruction the development of this cooperative has also empowered the economic uplift of African immigrants
living in the city so as everyone knows this is a very scary time and you know there's no moment like now to continue
to provide that funding for language access work so thank you again for your time and um have a good evening everyone
and I'll provide the rest in our written um testimony thank you thank you now we have Danielle Gerard you may begin
uh thank you Chair Nurse Chair Brandon and uh Chair Ales and committee
members my name is Danielle Gerard i'm a senior staff attorney at Children's Rights a member of the New York City Jail's Action Coalition we advocate for
young adults on Rikers and we support closing Rikers thank you for your efforts to rightsize the
administration's lopsided budget please continue to focus on budget priorities that improve the lives of our
incarcerated neighbors and other desperate New Yorkers funding 1100 additional correction officers to add to
the bloated DOC budget makes no sense given absenteeism and lack of accountability among current staff for
that $150 million the city could fund housing community-based mental health care ATIs and re-entry programs and more
we need less DOC staff for a smaller jail system not to continue
incarcerating mentally ill and marginalized members of our communities on the humanitarian disaster that is
Rikers we urge you to continue to put social services at the forefront of any budget expenditures every dollar spent
on those services does a lot more to increase real public safety than locking up thousands of people at an
astronomical cost and while you are at it please make our jails as humane as possible with meaningful programming
educational opportunities recreation and enough food so that people don't go to bed hungry on top of timely and quality
medical and mental health care we urge you to consider the testimony that we submitted on March 7th for your
preliminary budget hearing it explains in detail how children's rights believes the city's criminal legal budget
priority should be realigned to fulfill these objectives thank you for your work and thank you for holding these hearings
thank you very much now we have Donna Hilton
good afternoon can everyone hear me yes go ahead all right thank you thank you
uh council for having uh this hearing and having me present at this hearing my apologies for not being in person but
I'm out here boots on the ground i'm Donna Hilton i am the founder and president of A Little Piece of Light we
are women led organizations that focuses on the gaps that continue to exist with people that have been traumatized and
that includes which I've not really heard so much about right now at this hearing today trans uh people black uh
women black girls people who are have been in our military who continue to uh
face obstacles and and and issues and I just want to focus really quickly like my colleague said earlier the $1.5
billion dollars that's being allocated to the Department of Corrections to continue uh
uh a climate of violence and just lack of um support and and services that
people who have I I've identified really need and so we've been fighting for a
few years now just to get 10% allocated 10% of that budget so we can continue to
support the most marginalized of communities that that permeate our city
we deal with people that are in Brooklyn Queens uh Manhattan Staten Island the
Bronx and all over New York and we continue to have the least amount of services especially for women right now
we have a housing initiative that's being shut down as I speak i have to close them down because we don't have
that support we have been instrumental with the closure of Rikers and getting uh receiverhip we've also been
instrumental with passing the largest parole legislation in the country to shut down six prisons and to release
those people from out from custody who do not need to be incarcerated and so
I'm saying here today that we need to focus there needs to be a stronger focus on boots on the ground organizations
that are out there in the streets doing this work daily responding having Thank you for
your testimony your time has expired thank you
okay next we have Natalie Jammies or James
you may begin
okay now we have Sophie Guru you may begin
thank you all for the opportunity to testify hi my name is Sophia Gurule and I am a trustee and constitutional
officer elected unionwide by the workers of the association of legal advocates and attorneys United Auto Workers Local
2325 which represents over 3,400 legal services workers including immigration legal services workers at the three
knifup organizations the Bronx Defenders Brooklyn Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society UAW 2325 supports the three
knifup organizations in their request to double knife funding from 5.5 million per organization to 11.0 06 million per
organization as a UAW2325 elected leader as a line staff attorney in the New York
Immigrant Family Unity Project I'm here to emphasize the dire need for increased Knif funding i have worked as a senior
staff attorney in Nifup since September 2017 though I testified today in my
individual union capacity and not on behalf of my employer the Bronx Defenders my testimony today is based on
my nearly eight years of experience representing detained and non-detained New Yorkers facing deportation under three different presidential
administrations currently the UAW is hemormer he hemorrhaging legal services workers whose expertise is in detained
and non-detained removal defense the UAW has lost approximately 20 immigrant legal services workers at the Bronx
Defenders in less than two years for context that is nearly half of the current staffing numbers in the immigration practice with my nearly
eight years of experience I'm somehow the most senior staff attorney working in KNUP at the Bronx Defenders which
often shocks my union siblings in different practice areas at organizations like the Illegal Aid Society however high knife worker
turnover is avoidable our ability to stay in KNUP depends on having manageable case loads and salaries that
allow us to afford our rent and bills including our student loan payments our wins as unionized workers are wins for
the poor and working-class citywide union and non-union alike when workers working conditions thrive the community
thrives so when any of the knifeup organizations lose these workers that means immigrant New Yorkers who depend
on essential deportation defense legal services are not receiving the most experienced advocates or the most
consistent legal thank you for your testimony your time has expired often last years can I finish my remarks sure
go ahead so this is when workers leave that case load is then off offloaded to committed
advocates but those advocates are increasingly overburdened less familiar with the nuances of that person's case
and who are doing their best to stay informed and on top of rapidly changing immigration law and policy changes i can
personally attest it is extremely challenging every time a worker leaves providing stable legal services
is essential to ensure immigrant New Yorkers are materially supported against an explicitly hostile Trump
administration our work keeps families together it keeps essential caretakers employed it ensures immigrant New
Yorkers have a consistent legal team to call upon when the Trump administration finds new fun creative ways to terrorize
people new Yorkers need experienced attorneys attorneys parallegal social workers because an experienced knife
advocate necessarily means retaining a knowledgeable fearless and creative advocate i can send the rest of my
written testimony um later but I do want to invite any of you from the city council to you know witness and observe
knife up in action it's very easy to do you can uh go to the virtual courtrooms you can watch any of us you can reach
out to anyone at the UAW and we can connect you to making that possible um I
really highly recommend it it's essential to understand just how essential our our work is you can
observe bond hearings you can observe deportation trials or you could just sit a day in the virtual immigration
courtroom of immigration judge Charles Conroy who's often required to handle the proate cases before a knife attorney
is ever actually assigned so I'm happy to answer questions i know I'm well beyond my time and I'll I'll be providing the rest of my written
testimony thank Thank you very much
okay now we have Christopher Leon Johnson you may begin yeah um hello chairs abil nurse and
chair Brandon my name is Christopher Leon Johnson so I'm here to show my support to the Wolf for Justice Project and the Street Vender Project with their
um funding request u they they deserve the money i hope they don't get cut off this FY26 cycle i know it's going on
internally but they shouldn't be cut off this um cycle while at the same time I'm supporting uh their fight against the
NYPD with this ticket situation um I understand that it's a ebike crisis in
the city of New York but they shouldn't be the delivery should be criminalized i'm calling on the city council to find
a way to work with the NYPD compromise with the NYPD to put exemptions for
deliveristas when they do deliveries on an ebike they shouldn't be criminalized for um delivering uh food and medicine
um I know I know a lot of people that are sick and medicine is more viable than food and it shouldn't be where
somebody couldn't get their medicine because somebody got a summon or to the point that one of these liberties got arrested because some of them are really
language barrier with Spanish and Africans and they don't know the language so at the same time I'm calling
on the city council to observe to give the work of justice project um second English funding and streaming the
private funding at the same time I'm calling on you three um Brandon Ales and a nurse to hope you guys if you have
