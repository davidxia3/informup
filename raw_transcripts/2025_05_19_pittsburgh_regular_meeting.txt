Toteen Kodori
good morning council thank you my name is Laura Toten Kadori i am in the neighborhood of Allentown i am here
today in support of Ebony Lsford Evans better known as farmer girl EB her work
is invaluable to our community and our neighbors since 2020 she has grown and
distributed over 12,000 pounds of food with 5,382 of those pounds in 2024 alone
in the aftermath of the poorly managed food justice fund and council's concern for food security it would be a major
disservice if this garden was allowed to collapse and the city did not do
everything in its power to sell the property at 1707 Fulton Avenue to Farmer
Girl EP so that she can continue to do this work and teach future generations the value of growing our own food and
creating our own food security thank you thank you our next speaker is Natalie
Platt
i think that's Natala i apologize
my name is Natia Platt and I live in Sheridan i am in support and in favor of
former girl EB Ebony Longs Evans um she is a gym in our community and if
I could just tap into your heartstrings for a moment she bridges the gaps she
brings together the elderly and the youth and she causes them to work
together she educates the community she is a gem she is a help that is needed in
the community where people know her where people are familiar with her she
can speak to them and they feel like they are heard they feel like they are recognized she is essential in our
neighborhoods there is no one else who is advocating and fighting for the
community like she is in this manner this farm makes a difference to those in
the surrounding communities for those who are in lack for those who do not
have these are the people that she is reaching out to and not all of them are
people who do not have some of them are retired some of them are people who are
in need of something to do something to keep their mind sharp something to keep
them vibrant and in motion and this is a necessity in our community because we
need our elderly and we need our youth and she is the one who's bridging the
gaps so I thank you for your time thank you our next speaker is Felicia
Robinson i do not see her online is Felicia Robinson with us
if not our next speaker is Jodie Mclofflin
thank you my name is Jody McGlaughlin and while I am not a resident of the city of Pittsburgh I serve on the
Pittsburgh Food Policy Council board of directors with Ebony Evans i am here today to speak in support of Ebanesey's
work in Manchester and request that Mayor Gayy take action to ensure the land currently being used by Food for
the Soul Community Farm be sold to Ebony Evans at the very least I request that
any decision-making regarding the future of these tracks of land be paused until the city of Pittsburgh the URRA and the
Pittsburgh Land Bank clear up the discrepancies with the Adopt a Lot Farm
Lot and the 2023 triparty agreement ebony has worked this land since 2020
and donated more well more than several thousand pounds of food to the Manchester community in addition to
Ebene's personal investment Food for the Soul has been invested in by the Manchester community via the Sweat
Equity and Grow Pittsburgh with its multi-year new garden program why would anyone invest so much time money energy
and love in creating such a space if the expectation was that it would end at the end of a three-year lease according to
the 2023 triparty agreement any Pittsburgh adopt a lot current as of
this enactment date um of this that it is transferred to the Pittsburgh land
bank will be disposed of to the current leaseholder ebony is the lease holder
and she has been clear that she wants to keep farming with Manchester residents using this incredible site that they
have created together urban agriculture has been identified as a multiffactor investment for
communities particularly for the divested communities like Manchester research has shown community gardens and
urban farms increase property values public health researchers have also identified that these spaces contribute
to a reduction in gun violence and other crimes this is largely in part of community members feeling safer when
they are outdoors which in turn increases outdoor exercise which can lead to a reduction in chronic disease
and improved mental health goal three of the Manchester Chateau plan clearly
indicates a need to increase access to healthy food and community support services it can take a long time to make
these plans become a reality therefore while we've been waiting the residents of Manchester have embraced people like
Lisa Freeman and Ebony Evans as they have stepped up to increase access to healthy food and support services why
and do the good work people like Ebony are undoing community for the soul will have a more substantial impact on
Manchester than a couple of single family homes please do what is right let Ebony buy this land thank you for your
time and consideration thank you our next speaker is Kent
Bay he's not online i do not see him our next speaker is Patrice
thank you good morning my name is Patrice Balamop
and I stand here today in strong support of keeping our urban farm because it's more than a patch of grain in a city of
concrete it's a lifeline i'm also an urban farmer and share the same mission as Ebony and many of my colleagues that
are here today we live in a community that struggles with food insecurity every single day too many families here
rely on corner stores and fast food not by choice but because healthy affordable options are simply out of reach the
urban farm Food for the Soul changes that it grows real food fresh fruits and vegetables that nourish our children our
elders and our neighbors it shortens the distance between farm and fork making healthy food accessible and affordable
but this farm does more than feed bodies it feeds hope it teaches our youth how to grow their own food offering jobs
skills and a connection to the land many have never known it turns vacant lots into thriving ecosystems it brings
people together black brown white young and old and shared work space and purpose this is about justice it's about
giving this community the same right to fresh healthy food that wealthier neighborhoods take for granted removing
this farm would be taking a step backward erasing progress that has taken years to build we cannot let short-term
thinking or outside development erase a vital resource instead we should be replicating this model not replacing it
and I'm in the Allentown community i forgot to say that so thank you thank you
our next speaker is Brandy O' Allen
good morning and thank you for your time my name is Brandy Allen i'm a mother an educator a nutritionist and a doula i
also sit on the board of directors for the Pittsburgh Food Council i'm here today to speak on behalf of the Manchester community regarding the
proposed closure of the neighborhood urban farm 15233 Food for the Soul Community Farm as an educator and adoula
I firsthand see how lack of proper nutrition and food can be detrimental to growing up healthy and productive
manchester is one of Pittsburgh's most underserved areas facing long-standing issues with food apart where access to
fresh affordable and nutrition excuse me nutritious foods is severely limited the
urban farm in our community is not just a green space it's a lifeline it provides free and lowcost produce to
residents many of who live below the property line it fills a gap where the grocery stores and fresh food access are
non-existent closing this farm will be a devastating blow it means taking food off the tables of seniors families
medically disadvantaged and children who are already struggling to eat well it means removing a source of dignity
empowerment and health from neighbor excuse me from a neighborhood that has fought hard to have every resource that
it has ebony Evans has spent a lot of her own money time energy sweat and tears to ensure not only Manchester Eats
but Pittsburgh eats over 33% of black residents in the region are food insecure that's one-third and I know
that that number is highly not prop excuse me reported correctly manchester is a black community i urge that you
reconsider in a time where food insecurity is rising supporting this farm is not just the right thing to do
it's the moral and public health imperative thing to do people of a profit I'm from my Oliver thank you
our next speaker is Julia Thomas
i do not see our line is Julia Thomas if not our next speaker is Ashley
Wright ashley Wright no our next speaker is Kiier
Williams kiario Williams if not our next speaker is
Stephanie Elon
our next speaker is Nikki Joe Dawson not see online i do not see her
with us um our next speaker is Rake
Bay who is not online i don't see her in the audience our next speaker is Anthony White
good morning uh my name is Anthony White i'm from the uh Northview Heights
area um I'm here in support of Ebony and her um farm
um what she's doing is for people like me i have no idea about how it works i
have no idea the importance of it i don't have an idea of how it affects
people around the community and also involved in the community but from
watching her on um Facebook and um seeing what she does personally with the
young and the old and you know she's like one of us for all of us and I feel
like if y'all take that away from her like my ignorance will continue i have
children that need to learn how to you know understand the importance of land and understand you know the the
connection to it and the value of eating healthy and without these um kind of
institutions starting right now like we'll probably never get that information so like you'll be doing a
harm to a lot of people who need her to be inspired to even want to know what
that's about and even be a part of it um this is probably my second time ever
being in this building and it's like you know her and what she striving to do and
what she posted online affected me so much that I felt like I needed to be here to speak about her plight in some
kind of way you know I don't have the logistics of how this goes or who it affects or the numbers and percentages i
just know that it's needed and I had seen a post where she had all the kids together and I smiled at that you know I
thought that was amazing like wow these little kids can possibly change the way
everything is going and maybe we could make eating the right foods cooler you
know so I feel like if y'all don't you know help Ebony acquire this land that
she needs like it's going to hurt a lot of us um Anthony White from the Northview area
thanks thank you our next speaker is Jamie Christian
good morning um my name is Jamie Mary Christian i'm the founder and executive director of an organization called Let
Us Turn Up Sustainability Collective and I'm also a displaced urban farmer um I'm
here to speak um in favor of Ebony Evans u being able to purchase the property in
Manchester where uh Manchester one Sound Farm is um I've been here many many
times probably more than anybody else in this room supporting um urban farmers getting you know with
the land bank um being able to uh buy the property that they're leasing um and
also with the food justice fund you know getting funding for farmers um we don't
have funding right now through the USDA everything is on hold and y'all are aware of this um it's very difficult to
get any type of funding for growing food that's not being just to distribute but
also any other type of food access work at this moment um so you know Ebony has
been there for such a long time that you know that I mean I've repeated this repeatedly but um the statistics show
that you are 236% more likely to develop a mental health disorder if you are
experiencing food insecurity the soil remediation that has been done there um
by destroying that soil you are killing the microbes in that soil 300 miles um
across the surface and also two miles down that impacts your physical health it impacts your mental health um I'm
going to reflect upon a conversation I had with EB when we were sitting at Lisa Freeman's place last last summer she was
telling me about how one of the guys from um the Salvation Army um and some
of the folks from Light of Life when they're working in the garden they just start crying that's a trauma release
i've experienced that myself when I started my organization in 2015 I had lost a child the year before
that was my outlet that's what got me through that is the only time in my life that I ever did not want to exist and
the thing that saved me was being able to go to that garden every single day and work with those kids the same thing
when my dad passed in 2016 by taking away that farm from Ebony
and the work that she is doing you are doing a huge disservice to the folks in your community that need you the
most now my path as an urban farmer is different i'm not using the land bank we
had an issue with a landlord not taking care of mold and I have suffered
physical health issues but also I can't grow anything there anymore and I was just told you're better off getting out
well good luck trying to find a place that I can afford to grow indoors right now because it's not happening so you
know you are elected by your communities to do what is best for
them keep that in mind thank you be well thank you
our next speaker is Ebony Lungsford Evans [Applause]
hi my name is Ebony Lunford Evans and I'm here representing the community of Sheridan and Manchester well first of
all um I'm surprised to be here and I'm thankful to be here i want to thank you all because in early March I received a
call from um city planning and uh to my surprise I was so excited to learn that
that the mayor and city planning was supporting the sale of the Manchester
Food for the Soul Community Farm and I was super excited and told to reach out to the land bank and the land bank was
ready for the application to come through and I did exactly that and then I was um I I was met with a um a message
from Sally at the land bank to let me know that she wanted to meet with me before my application was complete completed it was surprising to me
because I am in in the process of purchasing a few properties uh from the city and I'm I'm thankful for it but um
or from the land bank I'm sorry and it was it was different for me but I was happy to meet with her because I wanted
to make sure that we were um on the same page and also I'm I'm happy for the guidance uh to be able to do exactly
what I'm supposed to do to purchase and when I met with her I was met with um a lot of guidance of telling me what what
I should do to purchase and uh the support that I would be needing would be different from the support and things
that I'm doing for the other applications and I was fine with that and I listened and um and and I walked
away excited and uh doing everything I needed to do to get my application together and was just also met with the
the reason to know that the votes are already in to not accept my application through the land bank and to and it's
leading me to believe that this is just super personal you know what is going on i shouldn't have to you know be excited
one minute doing all of this only to know that you know personal things are going back on and uh it's it's it's I
don't know if it's decided through you the committee through the land bank to just not sell it to me what's going on
and so I'm coming back to my city council to my mayor and I'm asking you all to help me let me purchase this
property and it's not for anything for profit this is all nonprofit i have lots of support behind me i have lots of
support out in the community from um from youth to seniors to the homeless
everything i do not want to be a pinned up against affordable housing i come from the projects i come from Northview
Heights we come from not having I need affordable housing i'm I'm learning more and more about affordable housing but I
shouldn't be pinned up against affordable housing um we we need it uh when we when we started um if I would
have known that that this was slighted to be that then we wouldn't be there but that just is not the case and we have been there for five years remediating
planning doing community these people right here didn't know each other before that but we meet each other on that farm
every Thursday every week and we work and over 12,000 pounds of food that has
been grown and given away on this space i'm asking my city to please help me please talk to the mayor and sell this
property thank you
thank you i saw Rak Bay has joined us online so I
want to go back to Rak Bay
good morning esteemed city council members um thank you for this time let me start off
by saying Malcolm X would have been 100 today and because of that we say free the land free the people um I'm Rocke
i'm the executive director of the Black Oak and Garders and Farmers of Pixber that started 10 years ago and the reason
we did this is because of the disparities that growers face here in Pixburg now speaking of that as we all
know black women in Pittsburgh have the poorest um chances in any other city that
includes maternal health education finances and so forth however there are
those of us who have done work to ratify this borni Melon University Center for Shares Prosperity and our esteemed mayor
Gene created a um equity group for black women but unfortunately this is just how
white supremacy works and here I am having to address this i don't use the word racism i use
white supremacy because it encompassed everything from the African slave trade
we wouldn't have been sold out if other Africans didn't sell us out from slaves running away where other slaves would
tail during the 60s code and tail pro where the government use other black
people to infiltrate organizations that was helping other
black people to nowadays gentrification and it can only start on the inside and
gentrification is unequitable and unfair development without community support and that's
what's happening through Ebony not being able to purchase her land it is a form
of gentrification and white supremacy yes it's for affordable
housing but food sovereignty is more important than anything because we all
have to eat even unhoused people have to eat respectfully the United
Nations came up with a solution and they said that food is a human right two
countries did not agree israel and America speaking of as of Friday 45
children were killed in the air air raid by Israeli forces this is a woman who
has helped our community who has helped children learn to grow food our
government unfortunately is falling in an unjust daily arena by not recognizing
food as a human right this is a principal issue and it's trickling down to our beloved city here in Pittsburgh
by not allowing Ebony to buy her land everyone has the right to eat and I
believe also this is a conflict of interest because the person in question
who wants to come is the president of planning commission on the zoning board
and ed of the RCOM MCC all right um moving forward it's important
thank you very much our next speaker is Abdul Kadir Chambo
thank you uh my name is Abdul Kadir Chambo and I live in North Side uh North
View Heights i'm also uh part of the urban farmers uh community or
organization uh I'm here to support Ebony because I
do have the same issue that she's struggling with and uh uh I don't know
it feels like uh I'm in Africa because this is a country who has a good
constitution and today we should argue more on how to instructure the rules and
regulation that we have of food policy but we are arguing about a lot of uh
injustice stuff which is everyone have the right to eat and everyone have the
right to educate and everyone has uh the right to go to work and that's what I
believe as uh Abdul Kadir Rambo so today
we are uh having challenge for Ebony not having the space that she's teaching uh
the kids the the space that she's teaching the immigrants who never have a
farm the space that uh you know welcoming people the space that can
support any other to save life and I don't know why we don't
understand that part i just don't know why we don't understand that part and
but uh Ebony has Ebony has been trying a lot by welcoming the people who
surrounding the urban farm area educating and supporting any other
things even food in a plate
so I will stop there but we do need this struggle to end uh this is not the last
day this is not and it shouldn't be the last day either but we need this to be
solved in all of our urban farmers thank [Applause]
you our next speaker is Sarah Williams
you just need to take yourself off a mute there you go sorry I thought you guys had to do that for me um hi my name
is Sarah Williams i am in Sheridan um Ebony has a farm in Sheridan as well as
the one in Manchester and I just want to say that she's wonderful and the work she's doing is wonderful and we need it
regardless of what anyone intended for this property at any point in time the decision was made to lease to a farmer
who came with long-term plans to feed our community and the intent to build something permanent for our community
and she has her commitment and efforts to provide food and show people how to grow their own have proven their worth
over and over again she's doing things for us all in a way that no one else is by bridging generations neighbors and
rivers to bring us together there's been ample time to come up with a plan B for affordable housing in the area that
doesn't involve destroying an invaluable community resource that's become a staple provider of fresh food and
education for all of us the fact that any person in this room has had the gall in a city teameming with city-owned
vacant lots and blighted properties to try and pit fresh food and education for our community versus affordable housing
in some kind of manufactured Hunger Games scenario is both appalling and inexcusable there's an abundant amount
of space for all of the above and even more things that we need and want
we moved here four years ago from Seattle and I've seen firsthand what happens when conflicts of interest
overtake a city and development runs rampant over resources people and property let's not be like Seattle let's
be better let's be way better we don't have to choose between food and housing we have everything we need to do both
and more so let's save let's do it let's save food for the soul community farm in Manchester and create the housing we
need this is not a mutually exclusive thing please sell the property to Ebony
Lungsford Evans thank you thank you our next speaker is Devana
Eberhart do not see her online our next speaker is TJ
Johnson also not online our next speaker is Kirsten Raglin
Smith our next speaker is Ashley Cooper
hello yes we can hear you okay hello my name is Ashley Cooper i am from the
north side of Pittsburgh i currently live in Monroville um I want to start
off by saying that I do not know Ebony but she has a huge influence um
online um in terms of the importance of fresh grown uh produce for our community
um Miss Evans has not only worked her land with integrity and care but she's
also contributed in countless ways providing fresh local food supporting
local jobs and representing a legacy of resilience and perseverance her farm is more than just a business it's a symbol
of independence tradition and hope one of the many things that sets Miss Evans apart is her deep commitment to
community engagement her farm provides meaningful volunteer opportunities for people of all ages from students earning
service hours to seniors looking for connection to families wanting to teach their children the value of hard work
and healthy foods these opportunities are not only enriching they're vital
they strengthen community ties offer education and empowerment and foster a sense of ownership and pride among those
who take part we often say we value local agricultural food security and diversity
in our community this is the time to put those values into action supporting
Ebony means preserving not just a farm but a part of our community's soul black
farmers like Miss Ebony have faced a long history of discrimination and displacement in this country allowing
that to happen again here now when we have the power to do otherwise would be a failure of our responsibility as
neighbors and citizens i urge the city to do everything within its authority to
support Ebony Evans in keeping her land whether that means adjusting zoning offering financial support or helping to
resolve disputes her continued presence and leadership are not just wanted they
are needed thank you
our next speaker is Derek Brian Jones
uh yes good morning can you hear me yes we can uh thank you very much uh good
morning uh dear and respected council members neighbors and community peers um I'm uh
Derek Jones from uh the Allentown neighborhood i'm uh speaking in support of uh the efforts to
uh work out the allowance for uh farmer girl EB to buy the property she's been
working on for 5 years um happily it's been said uh better by
others uh already so that makes it a bit simpler for me but uh adding to it some is uh prag
pragmatics a 5-year track record of uh progress and investature community uh
connections is uh weighty to be weighty enough to be considered and my
understanding is that the uh the properties are being slated to be repurposed for affordable housing uh I
have a urban planning landscape architecture background if uh if the
plan includes having uh affordable housing in the area I mean it's uh odd to not have the
uh option to have uh a convenient nearby uh garden that could be enjoyed by the
residents of the affordable housing uh basically I'm advocating for significant
uh focused down thought on the uh the situation and the aspects and the fact
that uh any good plan can be revised and updated to do uh to do better and the
agreement uh that was proposed and the setup that began uh it is
um one of the worst things a community can a community can do to uh its members is to disenfranchise
uh demean or uh leave them lost for no uh no good reason uh I know there's
going to be lots of conversations to try and figure this out further uh I'm basically saying you guys uh it can be
done well and it can be done better it could be done best and give it the time and thought and I'm so glad for all the
people who have spoken already because they've covered the vast majority of things that uh needed to be brought to
attention uh again I uh I thank our uh city council uh member representatives i
thank the neighbors community peers and I wish you all a lovely day and a wonderful week peace
thank you our next speaker is Tanya Foster
okay good morning everyone i am here today to speak on behalf of Ebony Evans
or what some may know her to be as farmer girl EP i could stand here today and tell you how we have been best
friends since the sixth grade i could tell you how I've watched her overcome adversity succeed against all odds and
how she deserves everything good in this life but I won't i would however like to share this with everyone after
graduating college with her bachelor's and master's degree Ebony and her husband could have left Pittsburgh and raised their family elsewhere ebony
could have taken her knowledge her drive and determination and shared it with the community in another city within another
state however she chose to become a teacher within the Pittsburgh public school system after working there for
over a decade she moved to a different organization but still had a passion to educate children where she continued to
teach encourage and empower them within this city after some time Ebony decided that she was going to step out on faith
and pursue the purpose that Christ had put inside of her over the last six years I have watched her guide influence
and inspire others within the city of Pittsburgh i have watched her selflessly give herself and her time without asking
for anything in return although there are others in this city that provide the same expertise if you will I believe
that Ebony is a catalyst for the shift within the black and brown community as it pertains to growing food and
sustainability in regards to the food for the soul community farm some people may just think that this is just a quote
unquote little garden or a place for people just to come play in the dirt it is of course way more than that it is a
space that has provided thousands of pounds of free food to the community it is a safe space that the youth and
adults from all walks of life can come and be welcomed supported and uplifted it is a place of healing and restoration
for so many people it is a community taking this place would be detrimental to Manchester as a community itself and
to the people that live within it ebony has given so much to the city of Pittsburgh i think it's time for the
city of Pittsburgh to do what is right and allow the Food for the Soul Community Forum to remain in place and let it continue to benefit the community
that it resides thank you thank you our next speaker is Michelle
[Applause] Killer is Michelle Killer with us
then our next speaker is Leticia Branch
NS good morning um my name is Leticia Branch Naws i am located in the Sheridan
community and I am here um to express my full and heartel heartfelt support for
my best friend Ebony Evans she is the CEO of Out of the End in Incorporated
and founder of Former Girl E as she seeks to retain the property currently
home to the Food for the Soul Community Farm located at 1707 Fulton Street
Pixsburg Pennsylvania 15233 this is not just a property it is
a mission and a motion it is living it is a living example of what happens when
visionary leadership meets tireless action in the service of a community
i've had the privilege of witnessing the formation of this organization from the ground up i've seen Ebony show up day
after day with no promise for profit or praise committed only to the well-being
of the community she is more than a CEO she is a steward of the land and a
protector of the people who depend on it through her leadership Food for the Soul
has become a safe space for families seniors and children a place where they
can access free fresh and healthy food in a time when food insecurity continues
to rise ebony is also the owner of Farmer Go a local business rooted in
urban agriculture and food justice through this initiative she has educated
countless individuals about growing their own food understanding nutrition
and building sustainable systems that allow communities to take care of themselves her knowledge and grassroots
experience make her one of the most credible and qualified leaders in this
space the Food for the Soul Community Farm is not just feeding people it is
transforming lives helping families annually with no cost produce workshops
and training sessions for organizations like the light of life and other
nonprofits volunteer opportunities for residents fostering pride and ownership
in the community to consider displacing this space for affordable housing in a
neighborhood where homes are selling 500,000 plus is to ignore what's truly
affordable and necessary how is it affordable to remove access to free food
how is it affordable to eliminate a teaching hub that costs the city nothing
but gives such in return the true cost of this decision will be a loss of
health education and equity for an entire neighborhood as Isaiah 58:10
reminds us if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfies the
needs of the oppressed then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like doomday thank you very
much thank you your time has expired thank you
though our next speaker is Kesha
Bennett is Kesha Bennett with us if not our next speaker is Brenda
Simpson good morning i apologize for the dark glasses i'm just coming from my eye
exam so I'm having problems but I'm here as a volunteer for the food for the soul
up under the leadership of Ebony farm girl Ebony as a volunteer of five years
I've learned so much from her things that I weren't really interested in as
far as growing food and planting different things and learning about how
to grow to uh healthy food just to to do
naturally um Ebony has taught me a lot and not only has she taught me she has
enriched our community by opening up this farm where everyone is welcome
regardless of who they are the ages that they are whatever to come in she's been
a source of knowledge to a lot of different people uh she brought a
community together because we fellowship on there as well as learning about uh
growing things she has people from the light of light missionary coming there
which is helping them uh the Salvation Army those men come and they help us and
we help them so this is a benefit to our community this is a benefit that um
reach uses out to everyone because you could come from all over and get this education free and not only education
but healthy food and this is what we need because it's not always accessible
financially for those in our community and other communities so to lose this
area and to lose all of these benefits would be a tragedy thank
you thank you our next speaker is Dana Dhoni
uh hello council um I want to stress today because you've seen me many times before coming here to talk about food
access that I am here as a resident of Pittsburgh Polish Hill today as an
individual as a friend of Ebony Evans and also as a volunteer for many
years so this is personal and this is going to be hard to be not emotional
because I'm really here to talk to you Mr laval Councilman Lavel because for years I've worked in this community
alongside all of these wonderful people and I've not seen you i've not seen you
on the farm i've not seen you on the farm in your own district i'm hoping you're getting an education
today that all of these folks had to give up what they had to do today while you're getting paid to do this okay cuz
I've not seen you i've not seen you at Miss Lisa's i've not seen you on the farm i've not
seen you show up for food access in your own community i've I've heard from all
of them over years the complaints the need in a food
aparttheid community for fresh grown food i have watched for years the leadership develop from these strong
women i am so proud of these women i have used these women and these farms as
examples for years on how to do this right and there is a threat to destroy
this for affordable housing you should be ashamed of yourself because that is
not true and I know it's not true cuz I spent years researching it and before conveniently this last year there was no
affordable housing on that site there were 30 lots that were up for grabs for you to put a modular home into and
that's the truth you need to talk to your city plan and you need to talk to the people because
you are looking very bad all of you right now and I will get to the bottom of this and I will not have shame cuz I
work for no one right now except for this community and I am going to stand
with them to the very end this community is not going to let this farm go away you need to know that i think you're
getting an idea today we are not going to let this community lose this farm
come spend a day learn what this is about it is not just about
food this is an ecosystem this community has had decades you are taking away a
memorial space a green space a park decades this has been farmed you are taking away dignity you
are taking away pride how dare you make this community come here again
i know Teresa knows i know you know what she does i'm not here yelling at you today i'm not here yelling at
you i'm not here yelling at you Bobby where are you thank you
our our next speaker is Regina Platt is Regina Platt with us
if not our next speaker is Daresa King St
phelix good morning council members my name is Daresa King St felix community
steward and women's health leader of Pittsburgh representing East Liberty
today I speak for Ebony Evans but the community knows her as Farmer Girl AB
the heart and hands behind Food for the Soul a community garden and farmers
market that has educated and healed hundreds right here in Pittsburgh ebony
stands before you today not just a farmer but as a steward of the land that
has become a sanctuary what began as an empty lot transformed
into a thriving space where children learn how to grow their first tomato where adults in recovery reconnect with
purpose through their hands in the soil and where elders come not just for
produce but for peace y'all this land doesn't just grow food it grows hope it
grows health it grows connection and now it's at risk i'm asking the city of
Pittsburgh to sell this land to Ebony Evans so we can secure it permanently
for the people who depend on it for the parents who rely on our market to put
fresh food on the table for the kids who need green spaces to dream in for the
volunteers and recovery who say this garden has saved their lives food for the soul is not just a
project baby it's a promise a promise that no matter your background income or
struggle you deserve access to fresh food healing spaces and knowledge to
grow your own with your help this land can remain sacred gown for growth not
development let's preserve what's already working let's keep feeding
bodies and souls let's keep the garden in the hands of the people as we stand
in front of you today one day we all may leave this earth that we try and to
protect and preserve you will one day stand in front of someone who will make
a decision for you thank you thank you our next speaker is Tiara Collins
all right our next speaker is Sarah Baronus
hi my name is Sarah Branskus Stanton Heights i work for the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council and started volunteering
with the Food for the Soul Community Farm back in 2022 um when my daughter was six months old
she's now two and a half and we're still talking about this um back in the summer of 2023 when a triparty agreement was
being finalized between the URA the land bank and the city of Pittsburgh growers and advocates were here in the same room
highlighting challenges for land acquisition uh for ownership for urban agriculture in the city and for urban
agriculture to be a priority use for land we've met with the mayor's office council members staff at the Pittsburgh
Land Bank and staff at city planning about food for the soul community farm specifically uh I want to acknowledge
that there are staff at the city who are dedicated to this issue who've committed time and effort and have come to the table but I also want to acknowledge
despite these conversations we're nearing the end of EB's lease for the farm and she's still unable to purchase
the parcels that she has stewarded and she has no confirmation she'll be able to continue doing her good work urban
farms provide community spaces nutrition education and healthy food access points for communities across the city food for
the Soul Community Farm is a labor of love what EB has done to grow community and grow food is not easy it's been her
time her resources other organizations resources and efforts it's not an easy task and if the city council and the
mayor are committed to making Pittsburgh the best city it can be we can start by providing support and protecting
initiatives like food for the soul and for people like Ebony the community of organizations
that support urban agriculture in the city have repeatedly asked for transparency and decision-making support
for growers who put in their time and energy and resources and a clear pathway to long-term ownership we've all watched
the can get kicked down the road for this farm as we receive opaque and confusing responses about why it's not
yet under Ebony's ownership the clock is ticking and EB has done everything that has been asked of
her this is not complicated there is plenty of land and this land is best suited for the farm that is currently
operating on it prioritize the sale of the land currently used by Food for the Soul Community Farm to Evony Lunsford
Evans so that she can continue her incredible work
our next speaker is Don Marie Clipper Hall
good morning my name is Don Marie Clipper Hall and I currently live in the Mon Valley but I am the director of
community food access at Just Harvest and I am on the board of the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council
uh when I was thinking about what I wanted to say to all of you today I thought about how I could speak about
how important this farm has been to the community and to my own experience sitting with Ebony learning about the
farm's importance to the neighborhood while I ate ground cherries out of a raised bed during the urban farm tour
last year i thought about how I could speak to you about how I used Ebony's
children's book to teach my nephews how to grow tomatoes which is something my grandfather knew but got lost before it
got to me i could speak to you about how Ebony provides not only produce in the
West End and in Manchester but also to 10 other communities experiencing food
aparttheid as a partner of our fresh corners program but what I actually want to talk to you about I think is that the
city of Pittsburgh keeps asking me the same questions and ignoring the answers less than three weeks ago the
Department of City Planning had a meeting with me and a few of my colleagues at Just Harvest to talk about
what we can do for food access what can the city be doing differently how can we
work food access into the comprehensive plan a topic that was added to the
comprehensive plan sort of as an afterthought well after community meetings had gotten underway on a bunch
of the other topics that actually mattered to the city before someone told them it probably should and what I said
then and what I'm going to say to all of you now is that we have to stop
pretending that houses are all a community is when we're talking about low-income communities because I know
that those of you who live in Squirrel Hill those of you who live in Lawrenville those of you who live in Bloomfield those of you who live in
Point Breeze when people ask you what do you like about your community you have
something to say other than my house is there and people in lowincome
communities deserve the same thing they deserve to be able to say "I meet up
with my friends and neighbors at the farm every Thursday night." They deserve to say "We have green space we have
fresh food we have walkable neighborhoods we have things that matter to us we have neighbors who care about
us." And they deserve that every bit as much as highincome Pittsburgers do and
they certainly deserve that a hell of a lot more a lot more than they deserve to have
half million dollar houses built where farms are thank you for your time
thank you Tiierra Collins i saw you come in
good morning and Tiarra Collins she's here i'm here um as a board member for the
Pittsburgh Food Policy Council but more importantly I'm here as a mother and I'm going to talk about being
a mother and what Ebony has former girl EB she's a mom and she's a mom taking care of her whole community and I'm
going to make this clear to y'all as a mom of five children and not only as a mom of five children but as a mother who
fed her her kids' hungry friends who came to her house every day of the week
to eat because they didn't have food at home this is what former girl EB is doing she's feeding our brown kids who
are hungry because there's no food at home and this is what I need y'all to understand we're not here because oh
this is a this is oh we want this property for for for housing just like the young lady who just spoke there's
lots of properties go find another property because this property right here is being used to feed our hungry
black kids see I didn't know what I was going to say when I came here cuz I didn't write anything but as I got here
and rushing to get here it's all coming to me why this form is here this form is here because it's feeding our children
and you keep saying that y'all want to make a city that is livable and is welcoming to us brown people female
then prove that this farm is going to stay because it's
feeding our children i don't know if any of you know what it's like to have to feed a child who's hungry because their
mother is out there on crack or lost her job or can't afford to feed them cuz the system is unfair to us anyways but I
know what that system is and I know what it is to feed a child who's hungry and as of right now we still have brown
children every day going to bed hungry because there's not enough food so if
you have a farm that's providing free food to someone's child why would you take that away have a blessed day
thank you our next speaker our next speaker is Helen Gearhart
thank you um I am here on uh behalf of the um
climate action plan justice coalition and a volunteer member with the food
justice fund committee i am strongly urging that the lots on which food for
the soul um community farm are rooted be sold to Ebony Lunford Evans in
conformance with the triarty agreement that states that this land be sold to the current leaseold
as a longtime uh supporter and manager and volunteer with community gardens and
farms farms and gardens such as Food for the Soul build interg generational
learning and long-term relationships focused on mutual care to support
community health food justice and long-term resilience as national food systems
break down and climate change um impacts escalate community gar gardens and farms
will become ever more vital vital especially for groups
that have and will be most impacted by food apartheid systemic discrimination
and environmental racism most surely such farms and gardens are a
highest and best used that should not be placed in opposition to fair and
affordable housing as a long-term organizer for both housing
justice and food justice our city planning should reflect the reality that
we are an ecosystem of deeply inter interconnected resources needs and
mutual giving we need long-term policies dedicated funding and land use models
such as the Three Rivers Agricultural Land Initiative a community land trust that protects and preserves urban
agriculture and lands in perpetuity and provides the long-term security to
support the labor and the material and emotional investments that community
community leaders such as Ebony Lensford Evans have shared with our
community thank you thank you
um yes Mr president I apologize i need to go i didn't I have the DPW week i
just Thank you everybody these testimonies are very compelling and I look forward to talking more can I
register I votes for for the final bills for final bills yes
yeah okay thank you thank you our next speaker is Joanna Deming
good afternoon or good morning thank you for the opportunity to speak today my
name is Joe Deming i'm here in support of Farmer Girl EB Food for the Soul Farm in Manchester i'm here as a north side
resident from Perry Hilltop i'm here as the former executive director of the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council which has
worked closely with Farmer Girl EB over the years this is not a fight between farms
and housing ultimately we need a city where residents can live and eat and there's plenty of land as folks have
said in reality there's already a successful farm on the site now if you haven't had a garden I don't expect you
to understand what it means to move a farm but if you've had a garden you know what it takes how much time energy and
care to create healthy productive soil and get food to grow not to mention getting volunteers and community
involvement as you've heard this farm represents a major investment not just a money but
passion and time from community members it's not something you can pick up and move
i'm here to support farmer girl EP because she hasn't had a seat at the table as key as key stakeholder in her
community in the community where the farm is located it is the role of the community group to communicate with all
stakeholders in their community especially those with development interests so they understand where they
stand i'm going to repeat that so they understand where they stand this hasn't
happened it is city council and the city's job to mediate conversations when there are different development
interests for a particular site that hasn't happened while the lease was temporary
the success and significance of the investment means a city must find a long-term solution to secure the site
for food for the soul farm i stand with Farmer Go because of all she can contribute providing healthy food and
education and a vision for community self-sufficiency she's a leader in ag urban agriculture in the city offering a
critical resource especially as food prices continue to rise even at our biggest discount stores well farmer girl
Ed may not be able to feed everyone though certainly she would if she could the tools the skills and as you've heard
the inspiration she gives her community is having um and will have a continue to have a long lasting impact
i support Farmer Girl U because she hasn't she shouldn't have excuse me i support Farmer O because she shouldn't
have to fight for her dignity or for the right to continue her work we've all witnessed this work firsthand and her
impact speaks for itself i'm asking you to work with Farmer Girl to ensure she has a seat at the table and receives
transparent and frequent communication she understands where she stands and that you work to protect Food for the
Soul Farm thank you thank you our last register speaker is
Jonathan Walmck is Jonathan Walmck with us if not

some of the politicians that came to our building um especially
um Patique the magistrate now um Mr patik spoke to me i
didn't want to speak to him but I turned around and I said to him "You are the reason Mr pertik why we in this building
Katie are be being beaten with hammers and sticks you um let the mother still
live in the building but the police say that you and Arbor are dropping the ball
i am being threatened by the a bad actor that beat the men beat the woman and the
daughter and mother with a hammer and the another resident with a stick and
when I went to the manager I said "Clear war clear warning i am being threatened
i am afraid for my life." She said "Don't say that." I said "She is threatening me harassing me stalking
me." She She threw her big breast up in the air oh she don't talk to me like that but about a month ago I think it's
about a month ago they heard this bad actor saying "What did you say to my
mother?" And when they stood up she had the manager by her neck they all tried
to get in there but they were both on the floor rolling in front of the door and the um the bad actors hauling "Get
it off of me get it off of me." She said "I didn't hit her i'm just restraining her." So um I sweep in the building
early in the morning so when I saw the manager I went to her and I said "When I told you that I was afraid and how she
talks to me you told me when you put your big breast up and ear that she don't talk to me like you like that." I
said "Well but she she grabbed you by your neck." She said "No she didn't no she didn't i want you to know that I
cannot get food i can't get the I cannot get the food bank for my husband who's
crippled he cannot walk and she's insisting that he must come down he
can't even hold she they had vouchers he can't even hold a voucher when I tried
to explain to her that you are supposed to give us honor and respect she became very loud she's very
loud and she's brass she's I mean you wouldn't believe and I want to know how is the administration of Arbor running
your food banks how is that they got how could that be why did that manager have
to run we had volunteers where did she come from to she could take over the food bank and tell me that I cannot get

of angry black people generally 99% of black people have been
marginalized in Manchester and unfortunately the counselors you're
complicit you don't realize it but you're complicit the whole issue at hand is

PEOT and Esplenade down the throat of city council school district county
everybody well now they're $740 million for a darn
uh merrygoround but what happened in the meantime was now Manchester which is a
historically black neighborhood is pushed out of being uh
designated food desert why because 10 people who live in Esplanade and that
740 million development we're no longer lowincome so when they talk about
affordable housing I don't know what they're talking about because $600
$600,000 is not affordable housing this Wait a minute wait don't

uh Mr lavel President I nine eyes's the bill received required numbers of votes
is passed finally and now that takes us to motions and resolutions anything for members starting with Councilwoman Smith
thank you i missed some of the comments today but I heard enough that um I just
think that first of all I did talk to the women's the women on council because I think one of the
things we need to do is identify a better plan for the u farms that we have
i put legislation in years ago it was during co I think um when I saw people
waiting in line for food and then get turned away and it made it just made me think what could we do as a government
so people aren't so dependent upon us um to give get food and one of the things I
did was put in some farm legislation i think Councilwoman Gross and Councilman Cowill started working on some things in
her district and his district with it and I just think like we don't have very clear guidelines and very clear rules
and I think some of the things that we need to do is to sit down one of the things I just spoke with Ebony about was
and I do want to say all the comments I heard Councilman Lavell did sit down with Ebony and Lisa in my office i have
the photos and um tried to work through some things and I think sometimes we we
need to show people how to work through things with us you know in different ways because I think right now the
climate is just to be angry and to go right to social media and start you know trashing people and talking about people
and that's not always the best way to get things done and I do want to say that I appreciate that you took the time
in the meeting i watched you work with people but I do think that this has something really important it's I don't
think it's the development issue i think it's feeling pushed out similar to what the Hill District what my family felt
like when they were pushed out of the Hill District when they um tore down our house to build the arena and now the
arena's gone and you know I think that it's the feeling of feeling
important and um not feeling like you have no power in your community and I
and I hope that we could try to come together and I do think I talked with Ebony she's willing to sit down and meet
and I would love for us to sit down one more time if you don't mind Councilman Lavell but I think one of the people that need to be at the table is the
developer because maybe he can offer something that we couldn't even imagine um in our district or the one of the
people we have that I just shared with the women on council is um the person who does the landscape architect for
Janosky's Farms um and some of the employees live in Sheridan and they're offering help too so if we could take up
help from people that are willing to help us you know that have this expertise have equipment have knowledge
and and funding maybe that will help us but we also have money for the Sheran Park master plan which is where we were
going to put in a farm and you know renovate the pool and do some work there to start the master plan
my conversation with Director Hornstein although brief is that they he they
don't believe that they're going to be able to open the Sheridan pool this year because it needs so much work i was a little bit frustrated because the
money's been sitting there they could have done the work but he I think the idea is to move the pool so that's a
much bigger project and so if we do that that money is going to sit there this year and so we might be able to use it
for something like this or some different but I think it it all starts with us having a conversation and I also
think that the women's uh caucus should sit down and and go over the whole plans for the and we'll include you guys okay
for the plans for um for for farms and and for what we're
doing with the food policy council and what we expect you know of them and how others who participated you know are
struggling now and I just think like and Lisa mentioning that she's paying taxes and and you know those are things that
we could we could put into place that they get some kind of discount if you're providing food for the for the pe for
the public so I think those are conversations we all have to have so I am going to ask the women to meet but Councilman Lavell this is your district
so I'm going to be respectful and I do want to thank you for the meeting and I want to thank you for agreeing to meet again and um I do think that we need to
bring some developers and particularly this developer to the table to have a meeting with us because you you don't
know maybe you know he had thought about some different things that he could do or some maybe you did do you know I'm sure you exhausted every opportunity but
I think meeting Ebony is you know m it makes you want to change things she does such great work in the community and
such great work with the kids and such great work with the with the residents um and not just her but you know Lisa is
doing great things on the north side and others are doing great work across the city that aren't even noticed right now
so let's sit down and try to figure this out together that I just want to I want to assure the public that we're going to work through it but I want to also
assure them that you did sit down and you did have a meeting and you were working through some of those things so
let's try to figure this out that's it thank you thank you can I respond please
yeah thank you um I'm sorry no no no worries um so just to give a little bit of context here one this is not about
not supporting Farmer Grow E i think the work she does is phenomenal um which is why the land bank has actually
transferred her parcels to continue her work the URRA has sold her parcels and property to be able to continue her work
the URA gave her a $200,000 grant as part of the Avenues of Hope program so
we fully support her work however in this context the Manchester plan was
formally adopted by the city in that plan it calls for an entire section of
the community not just her parcels to be built and used as affordable
housing the Manchester Citizens Corporation was working on developing an affordable housing development for that
site then COVID hit so obviously everything got shut down during that time you're absolutely correct you did
introduce legislation people were concerned about where's food coming from etc etc she then applied for an
opportunity through the adopt a lot program to farm on those that parcel
within Manchester and through the adopt a lot program it's a temporary program so she signed a temporary lease that
expires July of this month which is what in part why we're now here where we are
manchester City Corporation has since still begun trying to move forward with doing the housing development in fact
they're in conversations well they're further in conversations but they've been working with Pittsburgh Scholar House to actually do an affordable
housing development on that site whereby they would be targeting women with children who are going back to school and trying to embed their lives um and
so it would actually be a couple hundred units of housing on the site not as some indicated one or two houses and so now
there's a tension there between how do you deal with the initial plans of doing the affordable housing with someone who
has invested time and energy sweat equity financial financially to a site
and that's the tension that we're up against um you were correct when we met last year I forget exactly when but it
was last year sometime and we initially met with her I offered to say "Well what if I can find you other parcels within
the neighborhood that you could actually potentially own because you don't own this site it's owned by the city it's a temporary lease." And she did as she
indicated today say well she didn't understand that this was a temporary lease that she had agreed to um
otherwise she may not have done this um so but at the time she also said no that she didn't want other sites she wanted
to stay where she was um and so that's sort of why we are where we are i will also say to your point of having a
better way of dealing with this that is correct um because we shouldn't be using
the adopt a lot process for people who want to have permanent farms right that's a flawed process we that does
need fixed i've had that conversation with the administration they they I believe are actually working on creating
a different way for those who want to have permanent farms to acquire land from the city i'm not exactly sure where
it stands but I know we've had that conversation some months ago um so that's where all of this is yes be more
than willing to have another meeting with you and Farmer Grow EB as well as
potentially Manchester Corporation who's leading the affordable housing efforts for the site but that's sort of the
context of why we are where we are i just think sometimes we get in we all dig our heels and because it gets
frustrating you know it gets frustrating you see things on social media and you're trying to do things right and you're trying to help people and
meanwhile you're getting trashed for it and um and things are getting misconstrued and that sort of thing i
just think like we all need to take a step back and look at how we can address this a little bit better and I want to thank you for your willingness to do that no problem anything else from
members can I just You going to say something about what happened to Squirrehill wasn't planning on it okay i've said
what I need to say okay i'm I'm Yeah police are investigating i saw her post i thought it was well said
i can I just say that I do want to say that when those things happen it it you know everybody can say oh it's happening
to that community or oh this is happening to this community and you know hate is over here and hate is over there but we're all spewing hate through this
whole election process number one number two is you know we need to bring us all back to the middle because this kind of
stuff eventually hurts all of us i mean eventually all of us fit in some category right so I don't want to see us
doing this kind of hateful stuff you I just I worry about where we are as as a
city right now i I used to worry just about the country on a national level and there were things I could only do on the local level now I worry about us on
on every level um I just hope that we get to be we get council can bring more
to the middle and and make people realize this you know any kind of hate or anger towards anybody is never okay
that's it thank you thank you Councilman Gross and
Councilman Coco thank you it's been it's been a long conversation about urban a um during my
tenure on council if I'm not mistaken council had rejected amending the urban
a code before I served on council there was an urban egg code that was trying an
amendment to expand it that had failed um and we were able to positively amend
and expand the urban egg code to include things like beekeeping and chicken keeping
um back in 2014 if I'm not mistaken it might have been 2014 or 2015 so it's
been a solid 10 years um of working with communities working with
advocates around how to expand not only food production but food processing
storage distribution and the entire food system so this council um finally
amended the ARPA allocations to create the food justice fund but again at the
beginning of COVID working with several council members we also launched the city farms program um that was uh we
didn't really took off I think finally in 2022 or so when we convinced the parks and recck department to hire a
halftime farmer so we literally have a city employee um halftime there is
another position we're trying to add money to so we could have two part-time who is proactively going out to
community gardens to test soil to look for soil amendments to create stronger farm plants to provide resources like
soil saplings seedlings fencing um and those are I think what we also need more
of um it's been a a long time in developing the relationship with the Food Policy Council and other active
organizations to try to look at including as was mentioned a
little bit in public comment um where in all of the city are the kind of what I
want to use the word arable like what are the what are the sites in each of parts of the city that are farmable
where food can be grown um and we should be looking as well I think proactively
to figure out where also is our affordable manufacturing because those places have been lost where is also
affordable food storage where also can we use our transportation network and support our small stores um and these
are all to me economic development not just community development and they're
an integral part of why cities exist to make sure that food can move around and people can have access to to buying
growing creating selling food um and so we we have made progress but clearly we
still have a long way to go um to making sure that we avoid these kinds of conflicts because we know from many
studies that on our poorest households food and rent um are both sometimes
equal burdens um and costs um and and that's just more true every day as
prices and inflation go up um and so sometimes houses you know households
families can become housing insecure because of food insecurity as well um
and so we really they are they are equal risks um and equal opportunities for us
I think to do better but I also do want to say how um in the work that we've done we have
invested in in um a number of community gardens in my district and created
helped to create new ones invested purchased um now for for a handful of
years um the things to help them succeed and I like to remind everyone that
sometimes these volunteer organizations we've all seen them wax and wayne in
their capacities sometimes it's the land that's needed sometimes it is some resources like actual things like 16
cubic yards of compost or deer proof fencing but sometimes it's also just people power and the organizing helping
them find more volunteers if their volunteers have kind of run out of steam or they've lost their way so we as the
city we have that we have land we have resources like things we can finance but
we also have people and I've certainly gone out and worked on um plantings and
um cleanup days at gardens with my staff and I appreciate and certainly my staff have done more hours than I have and I
appreciate them doing that um and we have things like trucks that can deliver things so um we're providing and we did
get thanks to council we did get a pickup truck for our city farms team so that they're able to deliver things like
wood chips and support those community gardens so that they succeed so the goal should be that we are growing more food
each year whether that's because they're getting the supplies that they need or there's more land under cultivation and
it does create new neighbors and representing a district that has
changed so much in population more so than I think other council districts around the city in the
last 10 years it's critically important that is the way we keep Pittsburgh pittsburgh is that one degree of
separation right we're not six degrees of separation sometimes I joke that we're like half a degree of separation
not you know less than one but when you have lots of newcomers and when families
get broken up because of displacement or gentrification you lose that network you
lose it the a safety net um and we need to fight against the rising land costs
as land costs go up we find ourselves trying to fight against uh developments
and sometimes out ofstate developers or these LLC's we've talked about before that are um gobbling up the shared
spaces in our neighborhoods and it's really hard to fight against um and because we'll never have as much money
or move as fast as this the kind of corporate market um so we need to protect the ones that are there whether
that's city facilities that's park property or whether it's looking ahead and getting ahead of the market to set
land aside um and so those are some of the conversations that I've been having with the network of people who who work
on gardening in the city and work on community farming um and so I really appreciate their work to create these
spaces so um there's a lot of good work i feel like we've gotten some of our homework in place but as a city council
right we need to now kind of move it forward so that it is um more effectuated so I appreciate it thank you
for your time thank you Council Maka thank you Mr president
so Manchester has uh farmer Eb and we have farmer Deb on council here and uh
you know over the past three or four years Deb and I have been working on you know city farms and multiple things and
and I see the interest I see the excitement in communities and you know that and and the fact that we have now a
part-time I think I think he's full-time now but I'm not sure on that and And actually we have a vehicle you know so
so it's really been great and they've been very helpful in you know things that I've been doing with the orchard and everything so so it so it was really
nice to hear you know this community come down Manchester come down today and speak to this and um and thank you uh Mr
president for clearing it up i figured there was two sides to the story and I guess I I guess I have a question is
um I'm sure they want to renew the lease I guess is that what they were asking or do they they want to outright buy that
property and is it something that's going to be coming in front of us or the
near future or that's all I want to know sure so two points of clarity um one of
the 38 registered speakers there was only one from Manchester okay that was Lisa Freeman um who spoke last um
everyone else was from around most yeah mostly from Teresa's district um so we
don't know which is the issue um her lease expires in July um she could certainly apply to renew the lease she
could apply to acquire the property which is I believe what she wants to do um is to actually own the property the
challenge is if she owns it as it is right now you then wouldn't be able to do the planned housing development so
there needs to so we need to figure out what the workaround is yeah so there's there is a plan housing development and
there always has been so um and she knew that going into the lease agreement
through she said she says that was not explained to her that she did not understand that so I don't want to Well
I'm confident you'll work it all out so uh yeah so anything you need from me let me know all right thank you
