[Music] all
right Uh good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's cablecast post
agenda on the safe passage program for May 14th 2025
Um why don't we have folks come up introduce yourselves and then uh I'll
let you take it away
Good afternoon David A Jones assistant director of public safety for the city of Pittsburgh Uh thank you so much uh
councilwoman for this opportunity that everyone behind me has been pivotal in our safe passage uh program So we will
be uh displaying the great things that we have done Just a little uh background
Safe passages started There was an incident at Perry High School Um Miss
Donna Buco from the Bule Foundation called Mr Tally Thomas Thompson and
asked him if he could come and just kind of put his eyes on some things As a result this uh safe passage uh
initiative started Then after the success of that we were able to get a PCCD grant Thus we're in uh seven high
schools and one middle school Just a couple quick data points and we'll be giving
this to you and your colleagues as is at the end Uh as a result of the safe passage program there's been a 27%
decrease in total discipline events 25% decrease in major discipline
events 14% decrease in student involvement
7% decrease in violent
offense in 2024 And I've been saying this and and we all been saying this in
the ages from 13 to 17 there were no homicides in that demographic which is amazing And that's
partly to the work that our our safe passage team has done And unfortunately
in 2025 so far there have been two teenage homicides but that's been from
uh gun play and not gun violence were people playing with guns young people playing with guns and that always ends
in u something that's not not so good Uh and I would love to say lastly before I
call up Mr Tally Thompson there's been a 100% graduation rate with our safety
ambassadors to date So that deserves a hand clap
So I I'll call up the he's certainly uh the brains and he's the the quarterback
of our safe passes project Mr Tally Thompson
How you doing thank you for coming Good So um just kind of jump right in Uh the
safe passage program to to me um is one of the
most comprehensive collaborations that I've ever been a part of in my life um
you know the way it got started with the Bule Foundation making that an initial
investment um in in community uh where you know the
model was pretty much that you had to get community members inside the schools to actually be a part of doing that work
Um and then being able to get the students involved with actually doing the work as well Teaching them the model
was something that was uh um extremely important and then all of the
collaborations with the different nonprofits Um the grassroot nonprofits from Infinite Lifestyle Solutions One
Nation Mentoring Arborly um and obviously you know Operation
Better Block Uh and then also what what was a part of the the secret sauce as I
as I as I like to say Um you know we started out in Perry and I have to give
an amazing shout out I'm glad she's here today But what kind of took it to the next level is that when Miss Ali became
principal at Perry So once we got that buy in um from the principal where we
started the program at which was you know thanks you know to Miss Ali um it just kind of took it to another level
but there's always been this collaboration as well with Pittsburgh public schools I think this may be the
one of the first times uh in my history of there actually being anou between
um a nonprofit the city of Pittsburgh government and actually PBS and they
were 100% committed um when and had two amazing individuals uh Dr Sacko and
Jason Rivers and you'll hear from them Um to be honest I just kind of wanted to throw that introduction in but what you
see behind me is the the collaborative work with our most comprehensive
collaboration that the city has ever been a part of Um and that's what everybody that's actually in this room
right now is a part of Safe Passage and making Safe Passage you know um program
that it is today So with that being said I think it's less of me and more of of them because they're the ones that
actually do the the heavy lifting So Councilman uh we'd like to call up we have four students to talk about the
pillars and we'll talk we'll bring two up at a time Is it okay if they come to the table yeah for sure please Okay let
me stay here The first two Come on let's go Two two
two ambassadors
No no let's go two at a time Right here Over here on this side
Please introduce yourselves discuss the pillar and then also how this um has
have you kind of escaped dealing with violence
Thank you very much Okay My name is Annayia Paulino and I'm from Alder Dice
High School Safe Passage is really a a really strict but comfortable program
for most of the students in our school We come in we conversate we do activities
to I'm so sorry No you're good Took a like to take our mind off of school and
the stress that school has on us because it's getting towards the end of the year Most of our safe passage members are
seniors so they come in relax and just try to get positive views and leave out
happy instead of irritated from school basically But safe passage really does
help a lot of students outside of our program Like many students that aren't members they come in if they have issues
they come to everyone that's in the program for issues For example I had a
conflict between friends that like we're going to get into altercation but I had
stopped it because I had a mediation between them to try to get solution between just social media stuff just
negative social media words comments It's been going around the school We got
to to a fair solution where they just separated and now the group is totally
fine Hi my name is Kimmy McKende I go to
University Preparatory and I'm a safety ambassador I'm a senior I'm graduating
June 12th if y'all want to be
there Um the program to me is a safe space I'm not a violent person I know
violent people and the safe passes ambassadors are the ones that try to
kill the disease of violence We we do activities We we try to diffuse
situations Um we're really just trying to change the
community make everybody's life better What pillar do you focus my pillar is
changing community norms I'm trying to change the way everybody acts The norm
shouldn't be violence period It shouldn't be if you're upset you harm
somebody else or if you're hurt you hurt someone else It should be everybody should come together Everybody should Oh
sorry Excuse me Everyone should Everyone should be able to live in a safe space
Did I say more thank you very much Give them a hand please You guys can go We
have two more Okay Students council
said you wanted to say more Next two please
Please introduce yourself a little bit about the program and what pillar you we'll be talking about Oh make sure you
do the mics Yeah just tap it There you go My name is Dami Mobley I'm a junior
at Perry And the pillar that I'll be talking about is providing identities because I want the young people in our
schools to be able to know like they'll be able to be heard and not feel like they're being brought down by other
students in the building just because of the fact that they might not have the same things that just all the other students in the building
My name is Alisia and I'm a senior at Perry High School and I'm actually one
of the first people to get into the Safe Pastures program I've been in the Safe Pastures program since 9th grade Not
even going to lie I was a little bumpy because I'm the reason why we have the
Safe Pastures program for real For real Like I'm I'm not going to make it seem like you know it's just all peaches
and cream You know everybody has their ups and downs you know like even it even helped me you know like I was one of the
people that was fighting you know not even going skipping class And it low key
like helped me in a way because I got Baldi I had Miss Danny and not let's
give the biggest shout out to Miss Ali because it wouldn't even happen without Mr Ali Um the pivot that I'm going to be
talking about is resources because everybody needs somebody to talk to like and we're young so we like to keep every
everything bubbled up like you know we don't like to talk to people and it's better for people to talk to people their age cuz not not everybody our age
wants to talk to people like not everybody our age wants to like talk to adults You know it'll feel more
comfortable talking to somebody around their age or somebody that's been through something that they've been through We also did like summer programs
where like we had Miss Miss Marquia and we did like
yoga We did like little girls groups you know She gave us like little gifts you
know like self-c care self-respect We also went on a trip to Atlanta and we
went to like a a conference meeting You know we met different people from all around the cities and countries You know
we met people from New York Chicago Atlanta Jersey We met people from all
over the city and it just brings out like a very good impact on students and even teachers theirel because they see
that we could change You know people always think like I don't see no good in them but
everybody has good in them Everybody could change and make a way And I have a
shirt not to like toot my horn but I have a shirt and it says "You don't get
what you wish for you get what you work for." Basically meaning it's not going to come to you You got to put in the blood sweat and tears to be successful
Excellent That's very good Thank you Um I'd like to mention that we are
joined by Councilwoman Strawber and Councilwoman Gross So excellent Thank you We'll now have uh Councilwoman our
two coordinators will come up um just to talk about because they are the the glue that helps hold our young young people
together You guys can go Thank you so very much You're welcome Ricky brick Okay
Mr Goodwinary
Yes My name is Daryl Goodwin I'm the safe court passes coordinator at Perry High School It was a pleasure when Tally
Thomas called me and said he wanted to make a change into a school that we come from We both graduated from Perry High
School and we wanted to make a difference When Ali came up and been the principal it made a big change in our
program We were able to do more things and we worked together as a team Like we had problems we had people that will
call us and I will call Molly and before it get to the school we'll be able to handle situations before it hits our
building instead of like if it's a fight on the streets by the time we get back to school Monday we already know about
it So we'll be able to attack the problem before it gets there and the collaborations with everybody in this room has been great and it's a pleasure
to work for safe program and we're all making a difference and we get the support that we need y'all y'all can see
the pudding's in the right end we got proof of the things that we have done we took kids to Atlanta we went to Seattle
we just came from the um Sandy Hook program that was in Philadelphia so we
are see our kids are going to see different things that they never had opportunity to see before and like I said I had a mentor that changed my life
and that's the thing I want do to the kids that I work with change their lives Thank you
Hello everyone My name is Maya Lowry I am the safe passage coordinator at Older Ice High School Um so being the glue
every day um I'm a community member Um come from where these kids come from So I see myself within them Safe passage is
allowing these kids to have the resources that they may not have at home Um allow them to get a paycheck every month regardless of what it's for If
it's clothes if it's for food um we're actually helping these kids within school but also outside of school Um so
the pillar that I connect with a lot is providing identities um and changing community norms because we're changing
the culture at Older Ice Um the violence it's nothing like it was before safe
passage Um we have teachers coming to us every day and connecting with them just
to stop the violence before it gets to escalating into the neighborhoods um we are partner with reach So if there is
something that is going on within the school and the violence is going to be out in the neighborhood I can stop that
10:00 in the morning 8:00 in the morning before the violence is to the neighborhood and children are involved
Um also like I said it's just every day working with these children It's it's something new but it's exciting and it's
rewarding because these kids look forward to coming to school I mean I've literally had students that have one point GPA who are now graduating with
3.0's knows and they're attending school and they love to come to school and safe passage is a part of that So um I enjoy
the work that I do I love the work that I do and these kids need this program Um I mean I do of course cuz it's my job
but it's about the kids cuz they're our future Thank you What's this real quick what's the pillars you speak of um cuz
council may not be clear when y'all talk about pillars Okay connected community norms like working with the community
being inside the communities and uh being able to take things from the community the school and bring it Just a
quick overview of the four pillars that you do teach the two Oh identity Identity You want to go on oh you can do
this to Okay Providing identity connecting community changing community
norms Um so the pillars that he's speaking of is our safety model that we um we of
course teach the kids and the kids have to know being safety ambassadors So providing identities um and detecting
high identify identifying high-risisk individuals within the community that we're working in which is the school
buildings that we're working in So um every day we're working out the safety models we're making sure our safety vesters know the safety models so that
when going throughout the building if they need to detect and interrupt the situation and diffuse the situation they're able to do that if they need to
provide identities to the friends that they know are you know high-risisk individuals or you know into violence
they can help us connect with them so that the violence can be diffused Um so that's our safety model and it's we
stand by it And we bringing everybody together like some of our safety ambassadors they get together we have
like events where we all get together and it's built on built on community things So when they see each other downtown okay we know them from being
for a safe pass So it stops a lot of the problems that's going on So like between schools you mean in different schools
different schools Yes We have everybody come together We do different events with everybody so everybody can know each other So if they see each other
that's like okay that's one of my safety ambassadors sister or brother and it changes and it helps out And like I said
they make sure we know everything that's going on so we can do things in the neighborhood that we need to do
Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Councilwoman We now have Dr Nino Sako and Jason Rivers I also bring up
Reverend Cornell Jones because he and uh Jason Rivers kind of do the same thing
Am I good to start am I good to go yes Okay Okay So one of the things that um
for just go ahead and introduce yourself I'm sorry Yes Afternoon um Nina Sacko
assistant superintendent for Pittsburgh public schools Um so one of the things that we thought was really important at
the beginning of this program was creating a memorandum of understanding um with the city of Pittsburgh that
really allowed us to see the vision um to fruition to to really realize um the
work that Tali and David were hoping um we would see happen So we really focused
on what our systems would be and how we were going to shift culture within the eight schools that had been identified
Ourou very clearly identified um our meeting times and spaces which we met
once a week every Friday for about three hours I would say um initially what we
found with those meetings um that as they progressed not only were we able to
identify spaces where we needed to provide supports but we were also able to identify ways in which culture change
could come about with systems changes within the buildings and how we could collaborate with the city of Pittsburgh
in other areas Um what became really just kind of glaringly important to us
was that there was a level of trauma that also needed to be addressed um within the schools which we were aware
of but how we would do that utilizing really and I'm going to use the term
brilliance of some of our students who live this every day right so how were we
able to work with our students to then make sure we as the adults were bringing
our best selves forward and providing the best resources and recognizing um how we could create change for for our
kids Um and that's where I'm going to turn it over to Mr Rivers who's going to talk a little bit about that part
All right Uh good afternoon everyone Um my name is Jason Rivers project manager
for Pittsburgh Public Schools I oversee the work that we do in the arena of violence uh prevention and intervention
Um safe passage as you know has been shared uh the collaboration between
entities um around you know how we think about safety and wellness inside of our
school buildings inside of our communities and how this ecosystem um
communicates with each other And so uh this collaboration has allowed the opportunity when we talk about uh trauma
complex trauma that families are dealing with students are dealing with at times
uh staff members the fatigue that they're dealing with Um and even as we talk about post-pandemic
um you know there's a lot of things that communities are still trying to stabilize on And this collaboration
allows um you know research speaks to you know where there's three caring adults around a young person um how the
trajectory the life trajectory uh is significantly changed So when we think about hope uh and hope is the word that
comes to mind for me when we talk about this collaboration and investment um
investment can come by way of you know economic resources and I think the greatest capital that uh this
collaboration has is relationships um being able to get in front of uh
concerns that young people have or that parents have Um even staff people have to know that um we're interrupting
snitch culture um where it's safe to communicate when I I'm having an issue
with somebody else and I don't know what to do about that Uh and and um you know so the the program is built on those
sort of pillars Um we do Monday safety calls where you know if there's anything
that occurred over the weekend um you know we can get in front of those things for the impact of school because we know
sometimes things from community carry into school and then vice versa things can carry from community uh back I mean
excuse me from school back to community Um so this this collaboration has been invaluable and I think about the
increased hope and excitement um that has been built um in mitigating um you
know violence uh instability So we we know we have a work to do but to hear the stories of young people the
excitement that they have from the collaboration and program and the intercommunication between schools and
principles where critical information is being shared where there wasn't systems in place for those sort of things to
happen uh in the past So you know salute to all the leaders that um have made it
occur Uh and and most importantly to the young people who do a phenomenal job um
and showcasing their brilliance and giftedness Uh the last thing I'll just say is you know uh I think another thing
that the program and young people exhibit is we talk a lot about like post-traumatic
uh stress right and many of our community members have experienced um
issues around complex trauma but we tend not to talk about post-traumatic growth
And there's so much growth around resiliency and hope and you heard some of those stories exhibited today Um and
so I'm excited to have a small part in the uh the work that's been done and um
uh it's it's a delight to hear the young people talk about the change and impact that it's had on their lives
What's important as far as our collaboration Councilwoman is that Mr Rivers is to PPS with Reverend Cornell
Jones is to the city of Pittsburgh Sir thank you sir
Um greetings every everyone Hello Hello Uh it's it's been exciting to see Um I
was there at the meeting that was at Perry High School when Dabuko called
people there Um to be able to talk about some of those situations and to see a
new principle a new vision and um these things come together has been um it's
been empowering and exciting at the same time Um I remember when uh when the
conversation was with Tali to be able to find those key individuals that could actually come into the schools that have
the relationships and now that to see that those key individuals are there and the work is being there and and I I was
blessed to be able to see uh some of the students in Seattle when it was we were at a violence prevention uh conference
and these young safe passages students were like on the forefront of leading conversations about what they're doing
and to the point where other people and other organizations were like "Yo we want to learn more that made me very proud to be able to experience that and
to be able to say that's they're part of Pittsburgh you know what I mean so like our collaborations are are everything
even to the point where if something is um about to happen like or something happen in a school um they'll they'll
send out a um a notification to let me know and let certain people know Jason
um Dr Sacko Director Jones and and um and school police to be able to let them
know what's going on And this is this is this is a 24 hours thing So we're able to jump on things to be able to
strategize So as um Tali was talking about So when the morning hits we already got a strategy together And then
once again we then tie into some of the our city social workers We then tie into the center for victims We tie into what
I like to call the village as much as possible to be able to pull these resources together I've as U Tali said
I've never seen a collaboration like this You know what I mean i've never seen it And it's funny because when we were outside in the hallway you would
think that we all work for the same organization but because that's how much we're used to working together We we're
used to you know in in a drop of a dime You know we talk every Monday morning you know we deal with each other on a
regular basis What and that's the social worker That's all of us working together to find out what it is to be able to um
tap into the resources that we need for the young people for the young geniuses And then um we end up getting you know
the the young people who are part of safe passages program we respect the genius that's in them So if they're
saying that we need to um add resources and for example like we found out that we needed to add some support to Carrick
um because of the the the the stress that they were having losing multiple students So like those are from
conversations and guess what we pulled the team together to be to be able to work up there and help um the the
teachers up there So these are we're utilizing the geniuses that are in these young people and in the um the safe
passage staff and just you know utilizing that still working together with the reach program utilizing the the
law enforcement piece then utilizing the strategies that we have and pulling it all together and it's been
amazing Thank you Thank you so much Uh I can't go any
further and we just have a couple more Councilwoman um Miss Molly is the principal from Perry We need her just to
come She's been our one of our huge biggest cheerleaders in this effort and we'd be remiss without having
her and she's been in this the longest with us
So I think as I was listening I don't want to repeat but I think where I'm going to kind of focus is uh resources
and then I'm going to talk about mediation And so for me the the biggest
benefit is the resources that our school is connected to outside in the community And so things happen in school It's part
of school It's part of daily life But to be able to connect to outside entities
and stop anything further from happening in the neighborhood is invaluable Since this well since I've
been principal Perry which is this is my third year Last year we had one incident
that carried that started in school that carried over and this year I think we just had one and prior to me and this
program being in Perry I don't think that was the case and so connecting and
me having access to I have access to Jason
sorry but to Mr Thompson to Mr Jones It's just invaluable and it links us
together When we think when I think of schools I think schools should be the hub of the community That's just my
personal opinion And so this program has created that And then the linkage
between us and outside the city is just invaluable I know I keep saying that but
it truly is Um the next I want to highlight changing the norms of your
school And so what does it look like when you change norms if you're an educator you know that in behavior
management behavior management system the highest level is when students can redirect other students and they can
receive that redirection And so we're not 100% there but we're we're
definitely moving forward Students have a bigger impact on other students And so
when you see a student stepping up and saying "Hey come on." You know that late bell's going to ring Let's go Let's get
moving you know Miss Amali you want to hear her mouth Um you know she wants us in class on time That makes a more
powerful impact than me saying "Hey come on Let's go to class." What Dami and Alicia didn't talk to you about and I
wish they would have because they are probably the best mediators I've seen I I actually think they're better than
some adults I could pull them in in the hallway they could absolutely know
nothing about the situation that's happening and they could mediate the students so that it could stop anything
from transpiring and when you see that you know that you're headed in the right
direction you know we say uh we don't expect perfection out of I don't expect
perfection out of anyone but we strive for it and so that's what I want to see in our students and in our community
what I think is important important And thank you Miss Molly Uh I just want to uh reiterate that we've broken down the
silos between this the city and Pittsburgh public schools I mean we can walk in to any school at any time and
feel welcome and be able to to navigate Additionally they can come to any of our uh places and everything is fine I think
the communication has been paramount We also use new air 412 that council has funded That is also the communication
system we use between our safe passage coordinators and our reach team So when
things happen in the school whether it's uh potential violence or the violence has already occurred they automatically
uh connect with our uh reach workers so we can get things together pulling Reverend Cornell Jones in if the police
is necessary that happens as well So we've broken down the sales This has been an amazing uh collaboration I just
want to reiterate that before we bring up Dr Norm Kanti can someone just The last
thing that I wanted to add is um you know Jason Rivers and myself will end up going to we'll make a home visit like a
lot of times you'll hear us talking about custom notifications for so from situations where we think that that young person might do something to get
themsel in more trouble or getel or someone else in some type of danger We'll go and visit a house We'll go and
talk to the family and that type of stuff and sit down and do intervention right there That's the type of collaboration that we didn't have before
And a lot of that connection came from um safe passage program So with that the
families usually thank us because that connection is there to be able to help bring peace
So when when when they're talking about this collaboration notification it's
actually a system that was a part of the new era system that anytime that a risk level assessment is submitted that has a
three or four um everybody that's actually here gets an automatic notification in their email right saying
a risk of a three or four has been submitted into the system and automatic email starts um notifying um everybody
that's at this table from public safety to even the law enforcement at uh Pittsburgh public schools and then the
collaboration kind of starts happening right away where folks are responding off of a risk level assessment That
didn't happen until um this collaboration uh between um the city and and PBS and and nonprofits um where we
able to actually um upgrade that system to add that uh auto that notification part to it So I just wanted to be clear
because you know there's some language but I want to be clear that it's it's an it's an alert system that if a three or
four enters the system an automatic email is hitting all of our all of our uh emails
Um I'd like to add also the collaboration that um exists which you know started out as being really
intentional with the development of theou but it has created relationships where when we do get a threat assess you
know an assessment from Eric 412 um when Mr Rivers and um Reverend
Cornell Jones go out The level of violence that is prevented at times is I
mean you're talking about life and death situations sometimes So I don't think that that should be lost um in this
space I don't I don't want us to not call that out because we have multiple examples of situations where where both
of these gentlemen um have really worked at preventing something from happening that could have been catastrophic Um so
there there's a part and that exists here that I just think needs to be called out on that Thank you
Dr Ki is with us from Dukane and Council We also have at the end we have some handouts and we can send stuff to you
electronically that will talk about our data and I know that part is super important and so we have that covered
but he would also can also speak to that collaboration as well
Uh first thank you all so much for having me here today Uh like my good friend Cornell said it was really cool out in the lobby It was one organization
and one family made up of so many different people and to be here with so many of my good friends and the people I got to work with is wonderful I'm a
professor at Dukane University um the co-founder of the Elsmer Benu Think Tank for restorative justice Uh it's I've had
the honor and the privilege to work with this organization at Dukane University We're doing what we can to support this
work through our school of education We're offering opportunities for our advanced students to work on analysis
and evaluation and refinement and improvement of the program giving what
they have to offer and giving them the opportunity to learn in real time and real practice with this situation Uh on
top of that our office of community engagement is working to look to help
score funding for this or for this program And personally myself I'm
working on a class called performing history autobiography in progress We've got some really great actors and writers
and we work with kids in the safe passages program and we're working sort
of on the identity transformation piece where we're giving these kids a chance to work with you know people they've
seen in actual movies that they like and who are listening to them and are getting them to tell stories their
stories and getting them to see themselves as writers and artists Not that they have to be that professionally
but that's a part of their identity And when you open up whether it's kids whether it's in my experience whether it's guys in jails whether it's police
officers when you get people thinking in ways that they don't usually when you use the arts and the humanities you get
some results that um you probably wouldn't expect So we've been doing that with uh students in the past couple
years at a number of the schools And we're also working with some accidentally we're working with some of your safety ambassadors through 412
boxing Uh we're running the same program auto performing history
autobiography in progress uh with them and we're putting together a book that's hopefully going to include a number of
all the kids and it's something like writing fighters or fighting writers right because all these all these boxers
first are fighting right and all the safety ambassadors they're fighting for their community right and they have such
amazing stories to tell and I think I don't know them that well but I know some of these kids and the kids that are
probably the best at this negotiation and this this intervention they're probably great storytellers So again
thank you so much Uh personally I'm thrilled I know Dukane with our commitment The university is thrilled
and it's it's just wonderful to be a part of this
Councilwoman That's our presentation We appreciate your have a chance to just recognize the director uh Danielle King

Everybody but this is this is this is the staff that that does the heavy lifting This is just the staff that does
the heavy lifting You know I I you know I have a pleasure of working with Director Jones but these are the folks
that are in the school really you know doing a lot of that that hard
work And go ahead Miss King is the director
of the Safe Passage program I'm just the creator of it
Dr Danny Hello everyone I'm Danielle King I'm the director of Safe Passage Um it's been an honor to do this work Um
Tally caught me back in well I actually met Tally um I'm a student at Dukane as
well Um and I met him some time ago um at the think tank um when I was pregnant
Um and he called me some time ago to do this work Um and I love it Um I'm
actually you know like I said a student at Dukane so I'm doing this work real time um learning how to improve um you
know learning I don't know just different ways to um support my community um
empower them um parent engagement parent yes parent engagement that's what my dissertation is on so um just trying to
think of more ways to get families involved and parents involved um when we
talk about um you know being surrounding kids um that is academic work um a child
is in in the middle and surrounding that child we have the family the school and
the community Um and we all have to intertwine uh for the best of the child

work with Director Jones but these are the folks that are really in the trenches you know and it's important to
recognize them Prepared to come and speak today Um but
my name is Marquia Lowry and I am the female um and coordinator and I work
across four schools Arlington University Prep Westinghouse and Older Dice And it
has been a pleasure working with our female ambassadors That's been my focus since I've been on board um with OBB And
um we talk about the impact that this program makes but each individual
ambassador has made an impact on me personally Um I know someone mentioned I
think it was one of our uh Perry ambassadors mentioned that they're viewed as lost causes and they're really
not There's so much potential so much talent um that I get to bear witness to
every single day working in these schools and they are making drastic change um and I give them the space to
be them And sometimes that's all they need Um to feel the hope to feel the love to feel the encouragement um to
work the model um and to be amazing individuals because they all truly are
We got You ain't say Rick and Casey but I don't know It's It's up to you We got Rick and we got one one more student
ambassador right two more Come on y'all Come on Let's do this quickly Councilman thank you so much for your indulgence
I'm getting hijacked by one of my
apolog first Oh I'll go Uh Rick Butler I'm a safe patch coordinator up at Old High School I think the biggest thing
for me is just like being able to build the relationships with kids and then actually see it come to uh come to fruition for them to do different things
Like we got Pat been with us probably since the beginning of the program I don't want to make his head big but one
of my favorites cuz I just seen the transformation in him and his behaviors and the way his discipline you know with him getting involved in other things
outside of school And we just had a kid who's graduating this year who was walking around with like a 134 Last
report period he had like a 32 or 33 something like that You know what I'm saying and his focus is like crazy right
now So I mean just able to see that see things like that and see them actually being involved in things like real big for
me introduce yourself Uh my name my name is Patrick Germaine
I'm from Aladise Um one big thing about
uh the group for me is like providing identities cuz like I was able to do that like after like joining boxing
outside of school and like it just opens up so much opportunities for your future when you boxing and stuff and this group
right here So like feel me i'm ranked number seven in the country
now and I'm trying to get that that number one I ain't going to lie We got
nationals coming up so you know Yeah You know what I'm saying yeah
Young man go ahead
Hello My name is Jahim Jeff I'm coming from Older Disease High School And for me a big thing about the program is
changing community norms Seeing like Rick as a black man coming to the school every day and you know going to work is
a big thing because there's not a lot of African-American men in the school present But also I would say preventing
identities as well because every like like the kids from youth prep said being a lost cause like there's no
such thing as a lost cause in the school because if you're if you're waking up each morning and showing up for school you can't be a lost cause That's the
first thing And I feel like providing identities is just real big on that
because there's something for everyone I feel like even if like for safe passage there's a lot of people out here safe
passage and they hear the four pillars and they're like "Oh we don't want to do that That's long No it's still a safe
space for people to come together to stop the disease of violence." Thank you All
right Thank you everyone Any questions Col we have some some
handouts we'll give We can also send to you electronically Um any question any questions yeah go
ahead members Yeah Uh thanks um thanks Council Member
Warwick for hosting this post agenda hearing and thank you everyone who spoke I really apologize that I missed the
first 15 minutes as I was getting out of another meeting Um so I missed some of the introductory remarks and maybe some
of the um testimonials but um this is you know this kind of collaboration and
this on on this exact issue area is exactly what we need and it's um it's
obviously borne out um we've already seen I'll look at the data but the anecdotal data I think qualitative data
is also important to see that um it is it is changing lives on daily basis So
um great great work everyone I I hear about different programs and I don't
always understand how they interact So I'm just going to ask the question this is its own program You're all operating
as if you're under one roof one entity And that's exactly I think what we need Um and then I also hear speaking of of
Perry and um you know I heard Diana Buuko's name I I also know that A+ schools has their program on truency and
attendance and sort of figuring out strategies for in each high school working with teachers and working with
the principal to try to wrap their community's arms around the schools I'm wondering how this program interacts
with that program if at all or if they're just kind of if they're integrated at all if they're separate if they're just existing side by side We've
worked with uh A+ schools Um we we've met with we I'm so we work with A+
schools uh they were a part of um language um I mean meetings when we were
you know discussing language and implementation Um so A+ school was actually at the table as I was working
with the Bule Foundation on the implementation plan Um so and and then
also you know depending on which you know school in particular um uh Miss Ali
could probably speak to the way that she uh creates collaboration between all the programs that are within her school And
that was something that we was intentional about is that we we didn't want to um for safe passage to come into
existence right and then say that you no longer need the other programs that that that are within your building So it so
safe passage in itself is a model that collaborates with uh other programs and
nonprofits that are already in the school and we just kind of use our model to fit them into um the the work that
they already do So when we started you know say passage if there was a school let's say one nation mentoring was up at
Basher right the principal uper says ty we would like for that individual or
their team to be our safe our safe patches coordinators right so we just kind of taught them the pillars to teach
the students that that they're working with and then add safety ambassadors on so now you end up having getting more
you already had one nation mentoring now there's a collaboration between us and safe passage and one nation mentor now
you get more the goal was that this collaborative language was what was going to because actually that's what
what it what it takes to be able to change the culture inside these schools is these collaborative um relationships
It it can't be one thing in and another thing out like that's called the hamster in the will where you're replacing one
thing with another It has to be this and that Thank you What I would also like to add to that is no I I just want to add
one thing with the Brashier um example um Tully also brought on someone from
Kasa San Jose to work with some of our students at Basher So there is that you
know through all of the collaboration that we're doing on our end when one of us recognizes something as he did like
hey this we need to bring someone on from this organization at Brashier because they have these relationships
with students and then we're you know we're able to do that um based on all the various collaborations and different
programmings Sorry director No problem Additionally our safe patches coordinators know the other uh programs
that are in the school and organically I mean they certainly get our assistance but they they talk because they're also
from the community as well That's great That's great to hear There was I think someone who wanted to speak
Do you mind coming up to the microphone thank you All good You can just speak Um with the
A+ community we also um Baldi and I the beginning of every school year we collaborate with them by um going to the
homes within the north side and delivering book bags to the incoming freshmen Um so we've been doing that
collaborative for what the past two three years Um so they're definitely you know somebody we work with Yeah thank
you And that's just you know the A+ example is one example but I heard other examples Kasa San Jose and others that
are in there too So great to hear that each school is sort of determining how best to um we even had uh Arborly
actually um pays for half of our safety ambassadors at Perry right and that was through the support of Diane where as we
continue to get more and more support other organizations wanted to actually take on the responsibility of funding some of the safety ambassadors So I I
mean when I say it I I I I I'm I'm I'm being sincere when I say this is one of the the the most um comprehensive
collaborations that I've ever been a part of you know in my in in history of doing this work within the city of Pittsburgh Can I add Ty to that um
because of the work and because of the collaboration that we've been doing there's an organization called Cities United Yeah that we work with And in
fact some of the um some of the students and that that are here a lot of us have actually gone to the conferences where
all the violence intervention teams from across the country come like they're going to because they heard about the collaboration in July They're talking
about coming here and looking at what we do because they're hearing about the collaboration is like a collaboration
like no other So that's exciting news then something that I think we should be excited about because a lot of they're
hearing about how the city and the county how safe passage is the reach program all of us from the city and all
that type of stuff are working together is strategically when in unity because a lot of times a lot of cities don't do
that and that's something that we've seen when we go into these conferences they will um there's issues because over
money a lot of times and things such as that as I said before we were outside as one you know what I mean and that's
something that people are hearing about across the country and cities united is something that if you look it up you'll see that this is a national program
that's doing amazing work and for them to look at us as being like one of the models so that they can bring other cities to see I think is important for
us for you guys to know about Yeah absolutely Thank you One final question
and that is um this this this really integrated you
know collaboration has been like the word of the day like so integrated and I I'm really impressed by that and I'm
wondering if I mean maybe to our PPS representatives or others if if you think there's room for this to occur um
in other realms So this is the you know trauma interruption uh or intervention um restorative justice
um realm um uh when it comes to say out of school time city and PPS right and
how we how we how we integrate more around that do do you think there's this is leading question but do you think
there's room for that um is there capacity is there room is there is there an opportunity or an appetite for that
um those kinds of conversations in in other realms
Go ahead I think there's always room for that I think um using the model or how
we approach this work because really I you know when we reflect upon how we got
to this space and how these relationships sort of built organically It really came out of that beginning
where we sat down and said "Okay what's important to PPS what's important to the city of Pittsburgh to OBB how do we put
that in a document that's going to hold all of us accountable but then the beauty it became more than just
accountability The beauty in that was all of the people sitting around the table really saw the potential in this
wanted to make a difference wanted to see culture change um and were just so invested and committed in the work
itself And that extended beyond just our small group you know and Jason too he's
back there um in Danielle but um that that we modeled that for the schools So
this was our expectation when we we would meet with schools regularly We'd go in and we'd have meetings with the principal and you know the coordinators
and the kids and whomever in the schools but at the same time we were al also modeling for them our relationship and
how closely we worked with one another Um and so I think there is room I think
that the intentionality and the authenticity really needs to be there and vulnerability People need to be okay
with being vulnerable in the spaces I know somebody also think what is uh
important if you talk about our stop and violence grantees So what we've done intentionally is breaking down the silos
giving them some some money so they're all working together you know throughout the zones cross zones throughout So yes
that is there's always room for collaborative efforts across the board and that's one of the things that we've been trying to push breaking down the
silos increasing the the communication and working together in a deep meaningful manner Councilwoman
thank you council member Those are all my questions Thank you all Thanks Councilwoman Thank you Councilwoman So
um I am so impressed I'm so really deeply moved and impressed by all of the
work that you all have put in Thank you so much I have given Dr Jones some hassle over the
years It's kind of excuse that's kind of our job on this side of the table right so I'm thinking back was three or four
years ago when you know I was like where is the data and now we've got it in our
hands right where are and I think you'll remember this one keenly There was a
room full of just men and I said "Where are the female mentors?" They're here with us today
Yeah And I see them and I'm so glad to see the female students and the female mentors And I really appreciate that Um
and so it takes time to put these kinds of programs together but also
um it really takes I I've heard the word genius said about the students the
genius leaders here and I think I I don't know but I wonder if like that was your turning point Like it seems like
you really you have student leadership here Um and I and I see that things have
not just pulled together but blossomed and grown
and beyond blossomed like grown trees And I I don't even know all the metaphors I'm reaching for here I'm not
that good at that But that um this is a really robust program that is making a
really really substantial difference clearly Um and so I really I can see that in your stories I can I can hear
that in your stories I can see that of the people I see in the room and I can see it on the numbers as well So thank
you for having the numbers I also want to admit that before I walked in here I
do I did not understand how big this had gotten Um I think a few years ago we
were talking about getting kids safely to on their buses
home Okay good Okay My am I really am I really that kind of out of sync with
what's that is that is not what we're talking about here Like you all are
creating um I don't even know what to say We've we've talked about collaboration and we talked about
community but we're talking really about um like a a new almost like it it feels
like a new Pittsburgh It feels really big Um so I
really appreciate that Right the the the kinds of um problems that we would hear
about at this table um that it's they seemed they seemed you
know too big but now we've got it sounds like
you've got solutions that have met their moment right you've created really
really big solutions for what were really really big problems so thank you
for because it takes it takes a little bit of a leap of effort and it takes your time and your your energy and your
love and your effort to keep it going and to do all that and every I can really feel that everybody in the room did that So really really appreciate
that So I mean again to recap I took several pages of notes right i heard
everything from performing history and storytelling
to really working on the trauma of not just students but also teachers and
staff and really kind of addressing all of the healing so that everybody had
more right you have to take care of yourself first so you have more to give right
um that literally the kind of core group were was spending every Friday
together because it takes a lot of the ex there's like a thousand or more
things to do when you're kind of like turning a big ship and you're turning and you're changing those cultures and you're changing um the way big people
have been doing things for decades or or and creating something new that you you know you don't know what the it is that
you need to create but you know you need to create something Um but also connecting the kids in our schools
to resources even jobs
um and outside programs Again coordinating with the other kind of charitable efforts that have been going
on for a long time but what didn't have really hadn't manifested the kind of
change that they had hoped to be right and I know the leaders of uh APO schools and I know the leaders of the BU
Foundation and I know what they have been trying to do um and have done in
other realms but to see it it happen so broadly and in so such a big way in like
eight of our schools is really amazing Um so I don't want to take up much more time because I think the value here
today was really hearing the stories I'm getting it in the public record Again just if you didn't know this is like an
official council meeting So this is in the record forever right it is You'll be
able to pull it up on the legislative database and this is kept in our vault um of video kind of minutes and
um because it feels historic too So I appreciate that So I'm not
going to take any more time Madam Chair I appreciate it Thank you Thank you Councilwoman for your words Thank you very much
Um yeah thank you So um yeah this is all
Yeah it's it this is all incredibly impressive and um one
thing I did have a well so one thing I was hoping I don't know if if if you feel comfortable for for our our our
ambassadors in the room if if you wanted to share and again only if you feel comfortable right but of an example
because I'm I'm I'm interested in maybe an example of how so you're working in
the schools sort of managing incidents as media ating but are do you have any examples of how you have brought
that you know home into into your community sort of outside of school time
whether that's in the summer or on the weekend or whatever like these skills have they ever helped you i don't know if you have any if any of you wanted to
share Um since going to Orthodox a lot of us come from the same communities
like Hazlewood's a big one A lot of the Hazlewood a lot of students from Ordex go to Hazlewood I mean come come from
Hazlewood And I'll say a lot of things that happens in school will travel outside of school But I'll say this like
as a safety ambassador if they see me or they if they see me and they know like "Oh that's like if I say something like
"Oh come on Like everybody just chill out It's not cool." That it will stick into someone's head like because even if
I just say it to one person if he goes and says it to one more person it spreads like it spreads like that It can stop
the disease of violence just like that Yeah Anyone else yeah Go ahead
Can you re uh repeat the question one more time well just if there's if you if you can think of an example where sort
of what you've learned in this program at school participating in this has helped you out sort of in the world in
your own in your own life whether on the weekends at night on in the summer whatever just in your own community Like
when I'm outside like on a normal day and like I just like you know see people
just on some stuff like I just be like you know I be trying to help them out You feel what I'm saying like I don't
know like now like like when people doing bad stuff or like you know what
I'm saying like cussing and stuff it just like it's like it just gross me out You know what I'm saying i got to help them out You feel what I'm saying get
them on track You feel me yeah That's about it Great
Um I feel like being a part of this and since I get paid to do it it's my job to
like interrupt things before they escalate to something bigger because I go to you prep So anything that happens
in school will be an even bigger thing out of school Everything has to be a brawl Like if you don't interrupt it
everybody's going to be in the situation So should I say a story are
you an example it's a couple examples that we have to kind of live with that
Um there were two girls younger girls cuz I don't know why but like all the
younger girls are starting to be like the disease They're they're the infectors Like everything that happens
is within them I feel like we've like the older kids from I think the seniors
that graduated last year from safe and passage safe passage has impacted them so much that the kids that are coming
out they don't do like the stuff they used to do There's not as much violence with them Nobody wants to go out in
school and fight cuz we're all getting older We all have learned like it's not doing anything for us So these girls
there they were probably fighting about a boy or something It wasn't it wasn't anything that couldn't be
solved So I think I seen them in the hall one day and they're arguing but it's like their friend group is arguing
and the other girls friend group is arguing and I'm like it's getting to the
point It's it's about to be a big thing Everybody's running up there to see they're about to fight and I'm just like
I pull the girl to the side and I'm like what are you going to get out of this like you're fighting her because of this
boy and the boy he he's not going to come and like pick one of y'all It's not going to be a I'll get you I'll get you
Y'all just going to be fighting Neither one of yall is going to have the boy after that or y'all still going to have to
share So I'm like like what do you even want to fight her for she disrespected
me She said this She said that But it's it's about the boy You're arguing about
the boy So I'm just like like what if you get beat up like you're
just gonna fight her Somebody's gonna win somebody's going to lose but it's not going to solve the problem You're
still going to argue and then it's going to get to the friends It's going to affect everybody
They're going to be fighting It'll be just a forever thing ongoing longgoing and it would just never be peace
So I think that's the end of my story Like they didn't end up fighting They didn't know that And I think what's
important to to what she's speaking to is that the pillars that we teach the ambassadors the first one is
interrupting the transmission of disease of violence And that's an example of um when she kept saying that if she didn't
interrupt that then once it happened she she was saying how things become a brawl right and that's how that that that
disease kind of kind of you know spreads And also what's being clear is that she's they're paid on a monthly basis
They're on OBB's um payroll each all these safety ambassador We have 94
safety ambassadors on operations better blocks payroll um through this safe passage program where they're receiving
$200 a month and and to me um that's important to make sure I'm I'm clear about that is that the way that you know
it worked the grant worked we thought we was going to be able to stipen them but because it came from the state we had to
actually put them on payroll So we had 94 uh students currently right now as
paid safety ambassadors on payroll I also have another story just like
Cammy's but it was mostly outside of school I I would say I have a lot of
friends in Alderise I'm nice to everyone I'm just someone everyone comes to and talks to if they have an issue I will
say there's a lot of issues when it comes with relationships Everyone everyone is in everyone's business when
it comes to relationship If you like someone it's going to get around the school It's going to get outside the school It's like there's no stopping it
And There was this day where two of my friends it was it this happened way
before I was in the program way before well it was the beginning of the school They had an issue where one liked a boy
and one was talking to a boy outside of school She I wouldn't say snitched but she told that boy that she liked her and
it upset her And during school before it happened outside of school during school
they were arguing and I'm I was just I think I was sleeping at this point but I woke up and I'm just like why are we
arguing what are we arguing about and they reminded me about something I talked to them about before they brought
it up to a teacher and other students are getting into it just making the situation bigger And I'm just like "Guys
we've been through this It's not that big of a deal." Then outside of school I saw them arguing while we were hanging
out They went to the side and started arguing I'm just like why are we arguing about this we were outside It's a nice
day and we're all trying to be a be all friends be all cordial
but you children are really really really hard to I don't know there I will say
freshman and sophomores like recent freshman are really hard to just like
convince to stop arguing about the littlest things especially when it comes to relationships because they don't
understand the big picture and they just want to fight They just want to get over it But what they don't know is just a
continuous circle It's a never- ending circle You're just going to keep arguing and fighting until you come to the
realization that you're fighting over the most tiniest thing So we kind of came to that solution which I explained
when I first introduced myself kind of came to the solution where they just separated It kind of diverse the friend
group a little bit It's a little rocky now but we're cool The situation is calm
There's no ice There's no nothing Everyone's just calm and to themselves now So I feel like the program really
helps me help my friends and even outside of school people who are I'm not
friends with And even if I personally don't like them I still would help them at the end of the day what problems they
have so they can realize that they don't have to fight and argue about it They can just get over it and let it be what
it is Thank you Thank you
Um so yeah one question is it is there is
there an element of the program or maybe looking forward with sort of like a mental health component sort of
availability of of therapy and or
Yeah Okay I'm sorry What we've done um in the past
um is that um we brought other organizations that specialize in that in
to have sitdowns with our ambassadors and it becomes a lot easier Um one time
in particular um after the uh event with the um the Airbnb on the north side
right that was a real traumatic event So we had a relationship with uh with um Centers for Victim right and they kind
of came in with our ambass with our our coordinators and had had sessions you know had as sessions So what we end up
doing is organizations that specialize in those different things we kind of bring them in you know when we have
those weekly meetings with our ambassadors so that they can kind of um have those conversations to where
typically if if you don't bring them in through the pathway that they're already familiar with then sometime they just
kind of reject It's it may exist and it's there but the kids may not kind of engage in it So that's one thing we've
been focusing on um when it comes to trauma is bringing some of those trauma organizations in along with us to sit
down with the kids on a weekly on weekly basis when we have those opportunities too Additionally we also have when there
are severe acts of violence in our schools we have social workers that also come in uh to work with the the students
But that's also relational in that um some of the social workers don't know
our students but if one of our members from safe pasture reaches there that kind of that helps that um introduction
go a lot easier So they'll sit down and speak with a social worker that they may not otherwise if these u vehicles
weren't in our schools We also have um they spoke about the new era 412 system
Um it's not just our uh data management and system of accountability but we also
utilize it um for external resources and referrals Um so like we're connected with the 211 app um and we can send
these resources directly to the students phones Um so there's so many resources
on resources on there So you can go on there um uh resolve um UPMC mercy
behavioral So um we can connect with all of those through the application as well
Great Thank you Yeah So I mean I just overall you know we you know we talk a lot
about violence and crime in the city and and you know lots of you know there's going to be a post agenda I think
tomorrow night about you know or sorry not a post agenda a public hearing about violence But I think that one thing that
a lot of folks certainly myself [Music]
um kind of don't appreciate is that when we are talking about violence and
specifically gun violence that you know well I mean I guess I could ask a question who
here of folks in this room have had a family member or very close friend have
lost a family member number or close friends to gun violence Just like show of
hands right and how many people ha know more than one person who has been lost
to gun violence like in their immediate right and that's something So I you know I uh
you know since I've been in this role and I have I I represent Hazwood so I have some good friends And and that is
always something that you know just hanging out you know just going you know just and and we have these conversations
and friends say to me like oh my son what you know was you know people who
have lost their children people who have whose children have been shot maybe they didn't but you know and
it's all per it's it's like everyone and that is so not the reality
for for example in in in my world right and I think that we fail
to recognize that when we are here in Pittsburgh talking about crime and violence and you know and I am so glad
that and and for me I find Pittsburgh to be very safe in my in my world right
Pittsburgh is very safe right in the neighborhood I live in my my kids walked whatever like it if you know and
so and and this is where the real danger
is and That is what you are all working toward solving and you're getting it
done Right when we look at these numbers when we look at you know a 27% drop in
discipline events a 14% drop of students involved in those events you know a seven you know almost 8% drop in violent
in just one year right that is actually solving and it doesn't happen all at once right and
so you know we all talk and it's easy to sort of sit in your armchair and watch Stephen talk about what should happen
what could happen You know but you know teachers are overwhelmed parents are
overwhelmed Uh kids are overwhelmed I mean even even in in any in any even
myself right i'm sure my kids teachers are overwhelmed and I you know and I'm overwhelmed But when you
add this reality of gun violence and maybe housing
insecurity and maybe me you know issues of mental health in the community and
you add all that together this this reimagining of public
safety and that is the thing right that is what that that is what we have been seeing here over in in Pittsburgh over
the past two three years right is a is this commitment to reimagining how we do
public safety and that is getting to the root cause right that is working
together in a co-response way like you said breaking down the silos because the police can't fix this
alone The schools can't fix this alone The city can't fix this alone The
community groups can't fix this alone The football coaches can't fix this alone right it takes everybody together
And I'm just really so impressed And I I love even that that
you've got the technology too right with the apps I mean this is this is so this is such an impressive effort And I I
love that I I I'm I'm really glad to hear that it's been recognized nationally you know Um I don't really
have any questions I just you know I just want to congratulate you all on the incredible work and thank you because
you are you are doing the work to make Pittsburgh a safer city I just want to
say to you thank you so much Councilwoman for hosting us You have no idea I could have filled this room up with people that wanted to come and
speak but we tried to narrow down that we wouldn't overwhelm but we appreciate you and the council woman for even just
entertaining us today and hosting us We appreciate that Thank you Thanks Oh I guess with that I don't have
my my little script Okay So having exhausted the business of this post
agenda the meeting is adjourned Thank you [Music]
