not here so we'll move into those that need read into the record We have one by Councilwoman Strawber
Council person Strawberger presents be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby
declare May 16th 2025 to be the day of sustainability and environmental justice
in the city of Pittsburgh May we have a motion to approve so move
second All those in favor say I I Proclamation has been approved We also have a will of council from council
Warwick Oh sure Thanks It's for minimum wage
Yeah Okay Do you want to read it or Yeah Sure We'll have it read in its entirety
Yeah please Thank you Councilwoman Warwick presents Whereas it
has been 15 years since Pennsylvania last raised its minimum wage to
725 And whereas every dollar earned for a worker today is worth a full 51% less
than it was in 2006 And whereas 32 states in Washington
DC have increased their minimum wage including every state that borders Pennsylvania And whereas Governor
Shapiro has called for the statewide minimum wage to increase to $15 And whereas 1.3 million Pennsylvania
workers would benefit from a $15 per hour minimum wage And whereas while
positive trends in job and wage growth are contributing to a strong and dynamic
local economy in Pittsburgh there are also placing they are also placing upward
pressure on prices particularly for housing And whereas empowering Pittsburgh to establish our own minimum
wage policies would allow us to ensure that wage scales in our city reflect the
economic realities that our residents face prevent displacement and brain drain encourage population growth within
the city and help to secure critical workforce pipelines for our growing
indust industries And whereas by calling for an increased wage Pittsburgh is
joining municipalities across the Commonwealth including Philadelphia Allentown and the city of Lancaster
which have passed resolutions in support of HB150
Now therefore be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh hereby urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly
to pass Representative Ronnie Green's legislation HB150 to raise the minimum wage to $15
an hour And be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh urges that any minimum wage legislation
include an annual cost of living adjustment and grants municipalities local wage freedom by lifting state
preeemption on wages And be it further resolved that a copy of this will of councel will be distributed to the
Alageney County delegations of the Pennsylvania State General Assembly and to the office of Pennsylvania Governor
Josh Shapiro May we have a motion to approve so move
Second Any discussion counciloman Warick Yeah So um I just you know as far as the
minimum wage goes you know every year I go um to Alderise and I talk to the seniors
just about workforce development stuff And one of the first things uh that I ask them is who's working
right and mo most most of them are and uh and I asked them how much they're
making and uh you know I let them know that in this economy no one should be making less
than $15 an hour right so you know minimum wage rules or not and and and a
lot of them are and uh you know some of them are making as little as you know 10
something an hour some of them are making like you know almost 15 an hour
So I really feel like anybody who is paying less than $15 an hour right now
no and I and I I don't I don't care who you are right whether you're
um a small business owner or a giant corporation or hiring a babysitter or hiring someone to you do your lawn like
$15 if you're not paying at least at least $15 an hour in this economy you are exploiting the person who is working
for you Um so you know it this and of course the fact that the minimum wage is
seven something an hour in Pennsylvania it's it you know it's laughable right um
but the problem is that that enables that exploitation right by having such a
low minimum wage that enables uh you know businesses
to you know when that 15year-old comes in looking for you know looking for a
job it enables them to pay them that $11 just because they don't know right maybe that they just don't realize what they
should be making because they're just not as savvy or if that's you know maybe um someone a a a a newer immigrant to
the to the city or something like that just someone who isn't as savvy about what they should be making right or what
that job should be paying because they just don't have that kind of experience So um yeah that's all I just this this
seems like such a no-brainer to me but uh I don't know We'll see We'll see what happens So thank you Thank you very much
Any further discussion seeing none all those in favor say I I I
I the will of council has been approved So that will take us to public comment
Council president we uh Councilman Cogle and I are going to do the proc for council Smith I apologize I didn't
realize that Please Neither did I
Ladies and gentlemen
Yes this is motorcycle
All right Oh Trace I saw you on the other
All right I get to to pitch hit here for Council Muel Smith uh for a very
important issue here So whereas motorcycle awareness month is the annual campaign to increase awareness of
motorcycles on the open road and advocate for measures that improve the safety of riders on our nation's roads
and highways And whereas motorcycle riding is a popular form of recreation and transportation for thousands of
people across Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth The safety of all Pittsburgh motorists is an issue of
utmost consequence and all motorists should unite in the safe sharing of the city of Pittsburgh's roadways And
whereas more than 800 875,000 licensed motor motorcyclists are
required to keep their vehicles inspected and obey current laws relative to the operator safety and equipment
Whereas in efforts to reduce the number of motorcycle crashes and fatalities the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation and the City of Pittsburgh encourages all motorists to avoid becoming another crash statistic
and take advantage of the free training courses offered through the Pennsylvania Motorcycle Safety Program And whereas it
is especially significant that citizens of the city of Pittsburgh be aware of motorcyclists on the streets and highways and recognize the importance of
staying alert practicing safe driving techniques and promoting motorcycle safety And whereas during the month of
May the city of Pittsburgh and the Alliance of Bikers aimed toward education a bait of Pittsburgh of
Pennsylvania's Pennsylvania's Alageney County chapter will continue their advocacy of motorcycle safety And
whereas the city of Pittsburgh encourages all motorcyclists to continue their efforts to promote safety and motorcycle awareness and all drivers to
respect the unique safety needs of of motorcycles And now therefore be it
resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby commend Abate for their efforts in teaching motorcycle
safety and awareness And be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby declare May 2025
to be motorcycle safety awareness month in the city of Pittsburgh May I have a motion to approve so move second All
those in favor say I I Congratulations [Applause]
Thank you Councilman Charlotte He he doesn't have a motorcycle but he had a minibike when he was younger I don't know who that So no I just want to thank
you all for coming down Uh I know I don't see Timmy here but I'm glad to see a couple new faces as well I no longer
have my sign if you have them I don't know if you have some on you They look a little raggedy like we're going to have to make an investment right so uh but
but I put one in my yard So it's uh good just to bring awareness for the month and appreciate you being here And
speaking of the devil who walked in our uh former president Councilwoman Theresa Kilm So
I just want to thank you all for all that you do I just I don't know if you realize but Dwayne works for animal care
and control and so I want to thank him He's a resident of Sheridan and uh his wife is here as well and they do amazing
stuff I actually coached their daughters in cheerleading and he got out on the field with them one day So but I'll just
say that real quickly that my son is a rider He's a police officer and a rider in another state and um I'm all I was
always worried about him riding about riding but I'm more worried about me driving behind him So Councilwoman
Warick Yeah I just want to say you know I I love having you all here every year and um you know I'm I love coalitions
and of course you know I don't ride a motorcycle but I ride a bicycle and it's you know it's the same issue It's the
same issue with pedestrians in our streets is the same issue with cyclists and folks in you know they're in their
cars they're on their phones they're not paying attention And uh and the other thing and I'm sure that you are um feel
the same frustration is a lot of times I hear sort of blaming the the cyclist or
the biker right like oh well they don't do and it's like look it's everybody makes mistakes right everybody right and
we need to be looking out for each other on the road The road does not belong just to to folks in cars right it it
belongs to all of us no matter no matter how we're walking or rolling through our streets So um I would love to see that
coalition with the cyclists That would be a fun press conference I'm sure I'm
sure you'd love that But thank you All members want to
come up Is that okay sure Oh Dwayne I'm sorry Did you want to say a few words first i usually don't give him a mic but
Tracy you remember when he was cheerleading right you could cheerleader right yeah Yeah I also spent like almost
20 years with another person there uh coaching the girls softball team in Elliot over that way So they kind of
grew up I'd like to thank council president for having us Teresa for doing this Uh
uh I am the uh chapter president uh newly elected this year Uh John on the
end right here he's our former he was here last year He's I replaced him as the president he had uh what 10 years
and uh he wanted to take a break to where he gets to sit in the background there and cause me problems Now uh
Michelle she's my secretary Dave Harris he's a former membership officer And then I have Rick here he's my product
officer He also was a treasure I'm also a district rep Uh I I serve southwestern
Pennsylvania six other chapters in our district including our chapter Um a bait
Um I'm kind of reading off some stuff here because I'm not good at speaking that well Um Abeta Pennsylvania is an
organization of motorcyclists dedicated to the protection of individual rights of motorcycles through political change
public education and charitable works As part of our mission we are also uh active in
eliminating unfair legislation as it concerns motorcyclist promoting motorcycle safety through b uh both uh
motorist and rider education improving the uh um the uh the
uh to the public Um couple of the things here that I'm
basically reading off our flyer here Um the uh license plates uh we were
responsible in getting successfully passed in the state Uh uh the obtaining vanity veterans are collectible and
disabled uh vertical plates for motorcycles The rider education it's a big thing Uh all riders need to
understand what the rules are in the road Um we ride out there a lot and
uh motorcyclists have to ride with their their heads on a swivel Um a lot of
people get used to the winter months in their cars They drive around and things like that and next thing you know bikes
are out on the road and everybody kind of forgets they're there including your bicycles So that's that's an important
thing Um the penalties we got passed where successfully passed a provision
that increases the penalties for careless driving offenses that kills or seriously injured people Um there's a
few laws out there Daniel's law Um that that law there was passed back in 2016
which is a big law and there's a new law that's coming out It's called the Miller's law Basically it but it's been
enhanced um that enhances penalties for accidents caused by texting while driving resulting in serious bodily
injury The new one that's coming out now is uh the Miller's law and this is the
one that they're working to get it that get activated It has been passed by Governor Shapiro Um what this entails is
is handheld devices Now eventually it's going to be to the point some people
like it some people don't but state police and other police departments will be able to pull you over Now if you have
a handheld device in your um last year in Pennsylvania it was 8,200
uh or yeah 8,200 motorcyclists killed in Pennsylvania There's also
875,000 licensed motorcyclists in Pennsylvania So it's real important and
uh I appreciate council uh giving us this proclamation again Mr President
Teresa Um that's pretty much all I have but uh thank you very much and God
bless Thank you And when you talk about uh partnerships I you know what I'd like to see is for us to do something with
our magistrates when kids get pulled over for racing with their little motorcycles all around the city if they
would have to participate in one of your educational classes I mean think maybe we can work that out somehow So thank
you All members want to come forward Thank you

Thank you The bill have received required numbers of votes It is passed finally That takes us to motions and resolutions Is there anything for
members councilwoman Smith Well first I want to thank city parks There's been a lot of good news When you see something
good coming out of the city it's usually with city parks And I mean they re uh reported that they're going to start
their movies in the parks They're um opening spray parks and um some other
things And I just want to make sure that we acknowledge them and the work that they do with such a small budget and the partnerships that they have I just want
to thank them for the good news coming out of the city Um but I also want to remind people that we have two things on
Thursday in district 2 One is the Elliott City in the streets event I
believe that's from 5 to 7:30 And we also have our city council public
hearing for crime in the city of Pittsburgh Um and that starts at 6 at
the in the same general area It's at um the senior center in the West End on
Wbash Street And so I I'm hoping that we can have some hear some of the concerns
of our residents and put something together to address some of the the bigger concerns um that council can
address There there are things that we can address and I think we we should be working towards those those solutions Um
but with that said that's all I want I did want to say that I do want to say when um we're talking about pools
Sheridan pool has 15 it has a million.5 in the plan
for Sheridan Park master plan including um 500,000 this year So I think it's
around 2 million $2 million for a poll That's what we put through council put through It is still waiting for the city
the administration the uh director to do something with that poll one night they announced that all pools will open That
was not my understanding that that was not one of them So if there's something that changed I hope that somebody would
let us know that that pool is or is not opening What they talked about is possibly doing something different with that pool Um but we have kids in
Sheridan that they have a lot to do in Sheridan but there still needs some place to for them to um to have some
recreation to cool off and and um and to be in a safe space And I do want to thank direct uh director um
Vargas Yeah director Vargas because she is having some conversations about what they can do what we can do to help the
kids in the community have some safe place to to be and to to cool off But I just want to say I just I
don't when we talk about all these areas that need some attention Sheridan needs
some attention for the kids but Espen also needs some attention to for some of the things they have It's a small area
and it's borders McKe rocks A lot of people want to climb over Esplan you know to get to the Sheridan part or go
over to McKe Rocks and I just want to make sure that that's always on somebody's radar That's it Thank you
Thank you They're waiting for a new playground there That's all Thank you Thank you I've got Councilwoman Gross and Counciloman Strawber
Um I appreciate Councilwoman Smith um uh thanking our parks and wreck department
and it makes me u remember how hard she and I fought to raise the wages for lifeguards as well as other members And
as a reminder it is all also uh recruiting for lifeguard season So if
you're out there and looking for summer employment the lifeguard um wages now
range from $1748 an hour to
$206 an hour And you got a good tan We should do take that job It's a great job
for people um across the city and as we encourage you that includes if you're
not a certified lifeguard if you can sign up now you still have the window to um have free certification
um at during as part of your training Um and there's number on well I can read
the number out loud It's 412 3237928 which is great news And it's
while I'm at it and I'm just literally reading from the city parks Twitter feed So you guys are doing a good job on the
the app that used to be called Twitter Um the uh a call that I often get in my
office is when are the vouchers for seniors being distributed for the farmers market season and the date I
have on my calendar is at the Healthy Active Living Center senior centers across the city on Tuesday June 10th
from 9:00 am to 12 pm and they're going to in the afternoon from 1 to 3 you can pick up
your vouchers for the city farmers markets Um so thank you I appreciate uh
a reminder that it's pool season again and it's lifeguard season again Um and we're grateful to the parks and
department Thank you Thank you Council Scher Thank you I'd like to make a motion to call for a um post agenda
hearing on the annual comprehensive financial report Second All those in favor say I I I Any
opposed we'll work with your office send the clerk to get that scheduled Anything else from members if not I just want to
take two seconds and thank you all for your vote some months ago now on the tread for Manchester Chateau Um I pay
attention you didn't but the final vote was actually cast by the county last week and they approved it as well Um but
it started here and made it through the school district We actually had a community meeting in Manchester yesterday about it focused specifically
on housing and how the housing opportunity fund and all the housing the bond and all of that is spread across
the city But now we have an opportunity to do something specific for that neighborhood So it was a good and
productive meeting but I want to just thank you all for your vote on that and helping move that forward I saw some
other I want to say something I just want to say something real quickly about that I I you know always admired how you
handled things so calmly and just really a matter of factly and I watched you in one of those meetings in my office
meeting with uh people about the farm and some of the things and you just handled it so professionally and so
amazing and I just want to thank you for that because I think people don't see you behind the scenes and what you do and I think if they had seen that they
would have also appreciated how you handled it So I just want to thank you for that and congratulate you on getting it at all Thank you Councilman Cau Yeah
No I just wanted to echo uh Councilwoman Kale Smith's sentiments I watched them do it in the lower hill I think for the
most part with the uh those properties there the SCA properties city properties URA properties all that stuff But but
