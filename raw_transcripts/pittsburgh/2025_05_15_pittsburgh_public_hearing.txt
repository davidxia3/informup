[Applause] [Music]
all right Good evening and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's Cablecast public hearing for Thursday May 15 2025
Will the clerk please read the t the subject of the bill this public hearing is relative to
public safety and crime in the city of Pittsburgh Thank you And for the record we're joined by
council member Barb Warick and Councilman Anthony Kogo who's also the
chair of public safety And um just to briefly just to say I've been received a
lot of requests for um a hearing a meeting something to express the frustration A lot of residents some of
you were here today um for the crime that's occurring in the city of Pittsburgh Different issues different
reasons And so this is that meeting and we're hoping that we can come up with some maybe possible solutions But I do
want to say that um well I'll talk about the rest of this after I'm going to call the first registered speaker is Sarah
Williams No
no no You You go She's not ready to go You're not ready to go No I'm ready I'm
ready I just If you want to take a second we can call the next person There's another registered
I just was surprised I was first Yeah because I signed up late I thought
registered speaker It's kind of hard to speak on this just because I don't even know what the meeting is actually officially about So I'm I mean I get
that it's public safety and I get that there's a lot of concern and issues around that but like we don't really have an agenda here We don't have any
specific talking points to talk to So I'm just going to say a few things about where I live Um I'm in Sheridan I live
two blocks away from Langley I'm on the corner of Zephr and Hammond I'm the house that has all the plants that
everyone thinks are weeds but are actually native plants in a pollinator garden Thank you Um it's a very
important thing and one of the things that's important about it is the kids really like it I spend a lot of time
talking to my neighbors because I'm out in that garden almost every day Kids stop on their way to school Kids stop on
their way from school Kids sit on our wall Kids don't mess with my plants because I've asked them nicely not to
and they listen to me And I appreciate that Um and those kids are I know a lot of
the problem that everyone perceives about our neighborhood and they are not here to talk about what they need and
what they want and what's missing in our neighborhood So I think that is a very
very important thing that we need to be doing as we talk about all of this and that's engaging the young people in our
neighborhood and I don't mean the ones that show up to an event because they're signed up for a group I mean the ones
that are wandering around that are living across the street from me that don't have enough money to scrape
together for bus fair to get themselves to someplace that are facing food insecurity that are facing housing
insecurity and that causes petty crime We have no jobs in our neighborhood We
have no programs that provide activities that will allow kids to get paid for their time in any way shape or form And
until we start engaging with these young people and again I mean the ones that are on the edges until we actively
engage with them and it's not a bunch of us talking it's them talking with us and we are learning from them what they want
or need nothing nothing nothing is going to change There are programs in this
city that are successful and none of them are happening in the West End except for a very very few and they are
maxed out and underfunded So until we start seeing funding until we start seeing successful programs transferred
over to the West End from other parts of the city and until we start engaging with those kids petty crime is going to
keep being a thing And that's all I really have to say at the moment until we learn more about what's going on here
Thank you The next register speaker is Carl Sudter
Yes my name is Carl Sudter longtime resident of uh district 2 I
guess I'm talking about public safety is that lady is
uh public safety also concerns housing I have an address at 2781 Glenmar Street
It's right up the street from where that lady lives It's zoned in R2 area It was
illegally converted into three units with no egress from the second floor It's owned by a gentleman called Equity
Trust Company was bought in 2021 for
$75,850 Equity trust is run by a Nicholas McFalls and he lives at
23 or 233 Carrington Avenue in the north side Uh I looked uh 233 Carrington
Street in the north side He paid $411,000 for this property in
2022 As of today the property is excess for
$46,000 Uh that's what happens to Sheran The residents weren't paying attention
and they let the slum landlords take over their community So until they all
wake up and smell the roses it's going to keep getting bad So thanks Teresa for
having me Thank you Carl Now that's the exhaust our list of registered speakers Is there anyone else that wishes to
address city council tonight aaron did you want to Yes Come just come forward
Wow it's been a while I don't Is this on i don't think I don't think any of I don't think it's on
Okay Okay because I'm like I don't hear it Okay Um hi I'm Aaron Mulcheney Uh I'm
a resident of Bertha Street in Mount Washington and several of our neighbors are here from Mount Washington today Um
we have a lot of concerns about the speedway um that has become our
neighborhood Um any given night if the weather is over 60 degrees to 65 degrees
um we have an ongoing stream of racing motorcycles and later at night um cars
with modified exhaust that race up and down Bertha Street Ulysi Street um
basically the the streets that do not have the speed humps and the and the traffic calming measures That's street
That's street Um and it's it's really become an issue for a lot of the
residents when it comes to quality of life I know we talk a lot about retaining young people and bringing young families into the city and you
know we can't even get activity or action on enforcing a noise ordinance
from 1000 p.m until 6:00 a.m Um so it's been an ongoing struggle Um we've worked
with the council woman on this We've reached out to Commander Abraham I know we've been texting videos All of us have
Ring doorbells All of us have cameras that face the street Um we've sent
videos of the speed racing We've sent you know photos of who's doing it Uh we
send them in and it feels like nothing happens We've requested a camera The camera was put at the corner of Bertha
Street and Graan View Avenue We're not totally convinced the camera is being viewed Uh whatever footage is coming off
the camera Um we've requested traffic calming measures Um we've called 911
repeatedly Uh over the last I'd say two years now we've been working on this Um
one of our uh neighbors who couldn't be here this evening actually um did send
me the number of days 92 In 92 days um
there were 81 calls made to law enforcement requesting that someone come
and deal with the noise complaints and the and control what was happening on Grand View Um and there were 25
responses to those complaints Now I understand that there's
a lot going on in a city and we completely you know we're respectful of
that Um we know we're not the only neighborhood There's got to be a really creative solution here that we're not
thinking of I don't know that we need law enforcement to sit at the top of our street every night when it's 60 degrees
for seven hours but you know we'd love to work with the city and with the
police to come up with a solution Um because it's driving people out of our
neighborhood Um it's impacting our business community when we're business owners over here too Um am I cut off
okay Well happy to tell you more later Thank you And I will say Aaron was our
state representative for for you know a term So thank you Um anyone else wishing
to address Mrs Bailey
read the texture
Yeah Do you want to speak yeah
Did you want to speak yeah
Good evening everybody Even Miss Bailey I appreciate you all
coming to hear the community's concerns As this lady was saying and Carl was
saying I live in Sheridan When I purchased my property 19 years ago we
had a working police station We had plenty of police patrolling the area
Since that time it's like Mayberry RFD but we're not Mayberry RFD I've never
heard of a metropolitan city with a police station that closes That's ridiculous But that's not what I'm up
here for I'm up here about quality of life issues The city is not using
ordinance 670 as it should be used I get people sending me
pictures of garbage Not a little trash but
garbage that is pathetic We're It's like we're a third world country And not only
that we have companies that I sent the video to city council a couple of years
ago There's a company up on Route 60 They're
uh I bet I'll say the name of the company but they dump their debris in
Sheridan So I reached out to Joel Anger the man who manages the Jewish cemetery
in Sheridan because it I found it offensive These are these people's final resting place and we have companies
bringing their debris in dumping it and my fear is with all the hillsides landslides we
have on the hillsides that the cemetery is going to be destroyed by the debris that's going to
roll down the hill And I tracked this man down followed him with my cell phone
and took pictures and I submitted those pictures because somebody needs to do something But on top of that I have a
blog in Sheridan called Sheridan Community News and people submit pictures of trash that
they're forced to live by every day What can be what can be done with it right
now disruptive properties is only going after bars and commercial properties There's no commercial
businesses really in Sheridan It is the homes And as this woman said the
children need help but in order to help the kids you need to help the whole household you know because it comes crap
runs downhill You got to fix mom and dad so they can get junior together But the
issue that I'm here about really is the trash So I appreciate if you all could
enforce 670 and we can get the trash picked up find people do something Thank
you Thank you Miss Bailey Is there anyone else wishing to speak
apologize ahead of time Oh no Okay My name is Mara James and I'm a
homeowner on Stafford Street I bought the house a year ago in
July And what I've seen on this street was there's a house at 2940 who has a big hole in it that's in
court now So now two days ago my neighbors we both noticed that the hole
is spreading in the middle of the street Like the the cement on it is dipping now
is like halfway in the middle of the street Okay that's first problem Rit way
that's behind Stafford where she's talking about all the trash is that I
have three houses back there that just refuse to pick up their trash They'll
throw the bag the cars running it over and they just the Monday when it's
garbage day they just throw more trash out there It's It's pathetic And I'm
like I paid too much money for this house I got faith in Sheridan Something got to be done And and speeding from a
keys rocks is ridiculous The other night I'm in the house I'm like what is that i
can hear it coming up Stafford When they got past my house I could barely see the car That's how fast it was going This is
every single night And there's no playground for the kids to play at So
they play in the middle of the street somebody's child is going to get killed and I done called so many times to get
help on maybe get speed bumps in you know on Stafford You can sit in my house
and just listen to the Zoom real quick and there's babies out there because there's no playground for them to play
at And I told my neighbor I said "Please keep your put them in the back." But she don't want to put them in the back because there's so much trash back there
It's it's it's terrible I'll go out there with my broom and stuff and I'm not going on nobody's property but I'll
clean the street but I can't go on her property It's It's a mess It's a total mess Like with the whole the speeding
and the trash somebody is really going to get hurt I can see it coming And by me being a nurse they're going to come
knock on my door but still I mean I'm going to always help them but I'm like something has to be done quick I mean
the kids they don't have nothing to do but hang around and
just do bad stuff Like there's nothing for them to do There's no park And I'm like what what are you to
do there's no park in Sheridan for these kids
Wait wait wait wait We'll address that after We don't interrupt when there are speakers We let them speak and then
council responds Okay So I'm sorry Okay But let your child go to Sheridan
Park with one way in and one way out and all the bad kids go down there I wouldn't let my grandkids go down
there cuz it's dangerous It's secluded It's a secluded park I mean there has to be I even we
wrote letters I had a little small community meeting at my house to see if I could help these kids We wanted to
talk to Langley and see if they could have like extended something to let these kids come in there and play help
with homework I'll even get on there and help them But they turned us away And
I'm like come on These kids are the neighborhood Help them Don't let them
keep provoking to be bad because there's nothing for them to do Help these babies But they turned away Oh time up Okay So
I don't know what else to do Thanks Lori Anyone else wishing to speak
anyone else anybody from Westwood you know how to speak no Okay Anyone else okay Oh you
would do Okay I thought you did
Thank you Um I'm here as a resident and a business owner So we live my husband
and I live and work in Mount Washington And um we've been here for 25 years And
honestly the first 20 years our street was more serene than if
you were in the country Like for real it was so serene And now the noise
level in the evenings that usually start at at dark So whenever darkness comes
into play the noise level is so disturbing that the windows in my house
actually shake from the level of noise Um I have
been uh remiss in that I haven't dialed 911
because I'm not trying to be an ugly neighbor Um but I do know that 911 is
being dispatched and the only time we have called 911 is when somebody is
actually on our property Um but I'm here tonight to be part of the educational
process to learn what we as residents and business owners can do to
participate in creating a better quality of life um for businesses and for
residents to keep Mount Washington a beautiful place Grand View Avenue is a
park I don't know if we can stretch into that idea
uh for methods and ways to address noise
um potential I haven't actually witnessed a drug deal happening but
there's noise on the street that people are seeing activity that
resembles drug transactions So um that brings fear to me as a resident It
brings I don't have children but I don't even want to walk my dogs now after dark
So daytime walks is is what we have available to us because it's it's now a
scarier place to be especially as a girl walking out alone at night So I thank
you for your time and am willing to help participate as I can to be part of the solution Thank you Thank you
Is there anyone else before I You want to speak
and then you go Tony
Hello everybody My name is Tony Moreno I was invited up here to speak for some folks that are unhappy with what's going
on The basic thing that I hear that I'm being told I'm being asked to address
First I have firsthand witnessed a lot of these meetings citywide I I get asked
to come to them all the time and I try to get to them as many as possible but I've been up here three or four times
and we hear the same thing over and over and over
again You are the organization of people that represent everybody out here You
are our representatives You are our champions You are the ones that we picked to go out and fight for us stand
in the gap for us I'm just a I'm just a community member right now That's all I am I'm a retired police officer and
community member We pick you to stand in the gap for us To put yourself in
jeopardy for us To put your vote for us and not for you Stand in the gap and
fight what's going on in policy Folks you keep asking the same question and you're wondering what they're going to
do about it They're not going to tell you that this is policy from the mayor's office and they have to cooperate with
the mayor's office in order to get the things that you finally get Not that you deserve but that you finally
get These things can change right now These are not laws These are not laws that are enacted that you have to go
through your state representative to go through the house and get all the things that you need to change laws These are
policies These are this organization of nine three of which are here They get
together and they decide their policies and then they vote them and then they enact them Are they for the mayor's
office are they for council or are they for us here because right now I'm part
of us I'm just a person But I know what's going on I watch I study And this
is about changing policy and for our elected officials to stand in the gap and stop letting us get our butts kicked
out here in the street but for you to get your butt kicked on Grant Street for
us We will champion you I'm telling you right now Democrat or Republican we will
throw you on our shoulders and carry you around and say thank you for at least fighting these people They might tell us
to go get bent and they're stealing our money anyways but at least we can come here and not beg you for help but say
thank you for helping us And what more can we do i'm just asking for the people that call me to be here Champion for
us please Thank you Nance did you want to speak
um I'm Nancy Burns I just want to let the Mount Washington people know I grew up in Mount Washington I am an old Mount
Washington person I started the girls softball league up there when I was 16 I
want to let you know that those motorcycles and stuff have been going on for over 30
years Okay so it's not nothing new but I hope you get it resolved because it has
been a very long time going on The other thing I live in Sheridan
and there is crime There are kids walking around Uh we had three boys
about a month ago that walked around the neighborhood They didn't make it obvious that they were up to no good you know
wearing a ski mask and the hoodie over their eyes I didn't make it obvious you know but I came out on my porch and
watched them and they were looking in cars and I said you know do you see what
I asked my son do you see what they're doing and they turned and looked at me They walked up the street and turned around and yes I took a picture of them
I also informed neighbors from different streets because they were heading down towards um the park the park down there
So neighbors confronted them also No one's car was broken into that day Neighbors need to stand up because
we You can't let them know you're afraid I worked for the board of ed for 44 years You can't let the kids win You can
help them I had kids that were throwing rocks on my trampoline and I invited them in my yard and we had a fire We had
a fire pit They didn't know what a s'more was Had a s'more Never saw them again after that Never yelled at the
kids nothing But I tried to get them to see that it's it's not bad you know
Um but we need to work as a community too We can't just you know put everything
on council And I mean we need to block the block parties back the groups the
families the whatever And I mean I'm still a M Washington fan I'm sorry I
grew up here you know Um but that was That's all I wanted to say You know we we need to
get the the community together and do phone calls like I did and stop the cars
from somebody's car from being stolen that day Thanks N Is there anyone else
wishing to speak anyone else wishing to speak before city council i do want to
acknowledge that we also have Beth Pittinger the executive director of the Citizens Police Review Board with us tonight too Okay with that said I'm
going to turn it over to my colleagues and uh start with Councilman Khill who's
the chair of public safety Thank you Thank you Councilwoman Uh thank you all
for coming out this evening It's beautiful evening I'm sure there's a lot of other things you could have been doing Um as uh Teresa said I'm the
chairman of public safety So I've been following closely just so you know the numbers on the police department I
follow I've post agendas on it We keep a close eye on it And I don't want to scare anybody but we're at an all-time
low for Pittsburgh police officers We've never had less police officers patrolling our street than we do right
now Ever Right We're under 750 Right size is probably more like 950
Okay When uh Mr Moreno was on the force which thank you Tony for your service He was a good cop from all You're welcome
And uh so you know he had probably a,000 maybe 1,200 when he was working So so
we're at an all-time low and it's not just this administration's fault it's administrations beforehand Um you know
we haven't had recruitment classes to to stay with the losing we lose certain
amount by retirement but we're really plagued now by other municipalities like
Monroville My cousin's a police chief of Monroville My brother is a police chief of Cantonsburg There is not a year that
goes goes by where they don't talk to me Thanksgiving or Christmas whether it be
um that they basically cherrypick our our police officers right we get a new
police officers on the force for four or five years we're paying them I'm just rounding about at different levels but
say we're paying them $60,000 Well Candensburg will call and offer them $90,000 because it's it's it's
nationwide It really is It's hard to find people who want to be police officers today So I just want to start
by saying that okay well we're at a situation we're trying to do many things to um recruit and retain the officers
that we have but it's not going to be something that's going to be solved overnight So we're going to have a shortage for some time Um I'm here
speaking as a public safety chairman and as Teresa's colleague but I also am here
as a not as a resident of of District 2 but uh I'm no stranger to District 2 I
kind of grew up in Olympia Field I grew up in Beachview but you know we spent JFK football as a kid and and I know
Mount Washington like the back of my hand In fact my better half Lisa his neighbors with Kathy and Darren and
Kathy spoke up here owner of Grand View Bakery and they we live right next to each other So uh I see firsthand your
problems and Lisa complains about it all the time So I am here kind of speaking for a constituent my constituent of
district 2 Um something I agree Erin Kathy something needs to be done Uh you
know just last night Kathy I come home I'm taking Lisa home late It's always late when I'm bringing her home Uh you
know kids and what they do is they park outside our houses and they just like party there I don't know It's just like
a place for them to hang out Meanwhile we're trying to sleep and they're loud They're boisterous They throw their
stuff on the ground Um besides Bertha Erin I know I see it You know um we
really have to have police patrolled I didn't realize it's Abraham the commander I thought maybe that was Ripple So Abraham's the commander for up
there Okay So uh I couldn't agree more I will follow her lead I will tell you anything she wants me to do as far as
intervening and you know uh again speaking out just is kind of a resident
de facto Uh I see it all the time I understand it And and not only that you
go up Grand View Avenue if like you said one of you said when it's a nice evening out oh my gosh you can't even drive down
there They're just in the middle of the street They're everywhere So I don't know exactly what the answer is there but more police presence certainly would
be uh you know good start And somebody ticketing on Bertha Car I'll get to you man Let me let me go through everything
All right Well the boss here says you know she'll she'll let us know Um so so so anyway I understand the problem up
there Sheridan Um again I spent a lot of time at Sheridan Uh who was it sarah was
speaking to the kids have nothing to do You know Sheridan when I was growing up had one of the greatest sports
organizations around I don't know if they still do or not
Yeah I know But I'm saying they do not have a good sports They don't have a little Don't engage Don't do that Okay
Okay So anyway that's what kept that's what kept me my brothers out of trouble
growing up right it was the athletic organizations and things they do Um uh Carl what you spoke to as far as
the housing goes let me tell you we're seeing this all over the city I see it in Brooklyn I see it in Beach View You know we have a problem with like LLC's
that are some some of these people we don't even know where they're at When we when they're when they're overgrown or their tenants are leaving trash out or
need to be cited we try to look for the owners to site them They're all over the world What we're having is these
developers or real estate collectors call it what you want but they're gobbling up properties within the city
of Pittsburgh They know it's going to be worth something someday but meanwhile they're just sitting on them and really not doing much with them So a lot of them are just deteriorating It's
frustrating for me when we can't find where the homeowner is or we've cited them numerous times and it just goes
unanswered So you know um really bad We talked about the garbage You know I've
been cleaning up my own district I can't stand it I agree with you 100% Garbage is like it's a nast It's the easiest
thing to do for us as a city is to pick up garbage It really cost us nothing Some two two people in a truck going
around Um I took it upon myself I don't know if you've seen the Liberty Tubes the entrance to the Liberty Tubes the
nasty garbage and everything that's accumulated down there It's my district
No Is that your district or is it mine well I'm cleaning I don't know I don't know It's me you or Charlotte I I didn't
actually know but my district drives by it So that was that was like uh you know I I had to clean that up It really is
really really bad Um so so I agree with a lot of what you're saying I will say you know um one of the problems is the
lack of police presence getting police uh to respond to Mount Washington say when they come speeding up and down 70
mph on Bertha Street which is ridiculous Somebody is going to be killed up there
Motorcycles as well you know So uh yeah I just need some self of some self some
control up there Some some presence police presence whatever it is Again I'll work with Teresa Whatever she wants
to do with the police up there I'm a full partner because I'm vested also up there as well And Lisa Kathy I wish I'd
have known you were going to be here She's probably going to be so proud that you were here because everything you say she agrees 100% with and is always you
know relaying to me Other than she wants Fetzer and Bertha paved but uh that's another story So Um so so anyway I'm
again I'm the public chair public uh safety chair So uh any questions regarding the police and you know lack
of them or uh how we respond or how we don't respond to things I'm here to answer any questions And um I'll turn it
back to you Thank you And if he's going to do anything I want we're going to get our bikes and ride up on Councilwoman Warick did you want to
say something yeah sure Uh yeah Thanks everybody for for for coming out I know
that it's you know it's a nice night and you know I I appreciate you all taking your your evening to come here um and
talk to us And uh this is uh this is my first time here at this this rec center So I represent district five which is on
the east side of town right squirrel Hill Greenfield Hazlewood Lincoln Place Hayes Um uh so I I do I I have to admit
I'm not real familiar with your communities over here in the layout Uh but I've you know been taking some notes
Um Yeah I mean on some of these topics uh you know the litter I I hear you
right i hear you It's it's it's an issue in Pittsburgh right like like dealing with the litter and um it's something
I'm I'm the chair of public works so that means I I talk it's something I talk about with the director of public works all the time
Um I know that it um it feels like an intractable problem
but it doesn't have to be right and um and you know there there are plans uh
hopefully for next year But you know something that I I mean my personal feeling is that when it comes to litter
that we should be treating litter our DPW folks should treat litter the same way that we treat snow and um weeds
right is that you have a season right so so you know in the winter it's snow in
the spring and summer you know when the when stuff's overgrowing and you you know they cut back so you can make safe turns around you know that kind of thing
That's that's when you do you know that's the main thing Um and then uh you
know maybe after winter there's like pothole season right before before paving and after after the snow But I
think that in that in that like October you know September October November
season uh when the leaves are dead and you can really see right you can really see the hillsides It seems to me that
that should be like litter season My feeling is that if we can plow all the
streets in Pittsburgh uh within 24 hour like of a snow you know what I mean in a snow event then we can use that same
kind of system to go through you know take like a six week whatever period it is and go through and do like a deep
clean because it's not every street right so and do a sort of a deep clean on litter and then um and then just sort
of regular maintenance as as needed Uh that's that's sort of one idea But
another um uh sort of it's called the gold plan
like our folks in environmental environmental services are like the garbage and recycling like the
cleanup end of DPW Uh they have something uh sort of on the books called the gold plan and that basically would
be like to hire a dedicated crew that just does only litter u you know and has
like their own space So that's kind of two different ways to approach the same issue Um but we are obviously not there
yet right and um it's something that I am definitely committed to uh continuing
to push on you know in until we can get something in place right i it seems like
and I understand that it's a behavior thing too Um uh you know getting young
people not to throw trash out please tell anybody you know don't throw trash out of your car But at the same time we
should be picking it up because if there's litter then you're more likely to throw more litter right if there's litter on the ground you're more likely
So so um I I appreciate you um talking about that Um as far as the the racing car
situation um you know I I I texted our director of public safety at you know
this feels to me like um a need for patrols I mean again I'm
not I'm not from here I don't want to assume but this feels to me like the need for just regular patrols We need officers in their car regularly Doesn't
have to be all the time 247 but it has to be often enough that when
you're driving through you you don't want to risk it because you might get and and I do I can't again I can't speak
because I don't I'm not familiar with the zones over here I do know over in zone four uh we are starting a pilot
program with um our commander over in zone 4 where um they have like a
dedicated team and they sort of like they they circulate around the neighborhood So like they started it in
Greenfield and they did in Greenfield they did just like I mean if they weren't on a on a on an emergency call
they there was like this dedic I don't know it was like four or five officers and they were in Greenfield and they were taking you know they were ticket in
people if they're running stop sign you know that kind of thing um and then they moved to Oakland next right so I don't
know maybe that's something to to explore with your commanders right like
but it you know Um you know we are we are short on
police I think the the ideal was maybe 8 right 850 950 I've heard 850 but we are
below that Um you know we the the city is doing you know we've been doing recruitment classes Uh we did give the
police a raise I think it was last whatever their last contract right they did get a raise A few other things we've
been doing to to make it so that officers can spend their time on
on you know urgent violent crime as opposed to sort of not you know less
urgent is um the telephone reporting unit So mandatory telephone reporting So
instead of have so let's say your let's say your car got broken into in the middle of the night you come out
in the morning your car has been broken into right rather than having an officer drive to your house to like take that
report at your house you can call it in and that is saving some some time not
not a ton but but some right for our officers um I mean I know that before that I've seen officers I I was in a
restaurant once and I saw an officer get called because there was a dispute over the bill Like that's not what they
should be doing right that's not what we that's not they are these are highly trained officers and um so they should
be focusing on things like that right like urgent safety issues like cars speeding down the street and doing doing
that kind of enforcement That's my opinion Uh you know we also have an expanded social work bureau now of 60 or
so social workers So like if it's a mental health call that is clearly not a violent call right is clearly not does
not need someone with a gun We have a a social work team that can be called in to to handle that that situation So you
know it's it is it's it's sort of how we're kind of cobbling together while we
are low right making the most out of those of the officers that we do have right and making sure that they are out
and and and I think that I think it's fair enough for us as council people and for you as residents to you know to
expect that our officers are out on patrol in you know as much as possible
right um so um yeah thanks for for bringing
all that to to light here Uh the last thing is uh you know I I I really want
to say thank you to the two folks about the one about the garden about you know
inviting kids to enjoy your your garden and also like inviting them in to the
you know to to to the fire pit to like because I just just to talk a little bit we had a we had a post agenda I think it
was just yesterday about uh something that uh the city is doing called the safe passages program and that's
something that we're doing in seven of our high schools It's in Perry Aldderise Arlington Brashier Millions uh Milion
sorry Obama and Westinghouse So this is a program It is the city operation better block
Pittsburgh public schools uh reach right and it's sort of part of the stop the I don't if you've heard the stop the
violence initiative So these are folks in the schools they are engaging
ambassadors who so they're finding kids who are like at risk of violent incidences
um and kind of training those kids to become mediators amongst their peers and
I mean it was a really fabulous I I encourage everybody to watch the post agenda it's actually very moving and um
the I don't I don't I should I wish I brought the I don't have all the numbers
but I mean the the incences the disciplinary incidences in the school So for example in Westinghouse just in
Westinghouse went from the the year that it started they had
1,599 disciplinary incidences and the following year they had
874 This is a very successful program remarkable Um
uh also significant drops So like there there have been a 20 overall there's been a 27% this is just in like a year
and a half or so 27% drop in discipline incidences a 14% drop in the number of
students who are like involved right like these sort of high-risisk kids and a an almost 8% drop in in violent events
overall Um it's a really incredible program This
is exactly what you're talking about here right it is bringing people it is bringing adults together to you know
they even have technology like an alert system So if there is an incident in the neighborhood like o over the weekend
right and they hear about it right because you know this is community folks they get an alert and then
everyone mobilizes they're communicating between schools So if you have kids who
don't know each other between schools and there's incidences happening say on a bus or whatever between communities
It's just been a very successful program and um I I don't I don't know what what the
what's the high school for this i don't have one It's in Brerier Oh it's Brashier Language course It used to be
language That's part of the problem Okay Okay Well at any rate so you know these
programs do exist and uh and they're doing very good work and I know that it's not you know it's it's not
something that happens overnight Uh but it is it is happening and it is and it
and and there is success you know and I know that it when it comes
to sort of things like car breakins and things like that's that's sort of small
consolation right if your car is getting broken into but I think uh sort of
bigger picture it it is important to remember that you know programs like this are
leading to red major reductions in like gun violence Right like a 33% drop in homicides in the city and a 44% drop in
non-fatal shootings And these are these kids right last year in 2024 we did not
have a single kid between I think it's like 13 and 17 you know murdered by a gun We did
have two incidences this this year but they were not gun violence but they were
kids play you know like playing with guns At any rate one death is too many
But um but I just want you all to know that that this type of this issue of the
kids it is something that is this is a number one focus right now in our public
safety department at the city of Pittsburgh right whether it is our social work team our law enforcement
folks our community folks um you know and our other you know nonprofit
partners Um lots of work is being done It's not work that you necessarily see every day
but it is it is being we are taking it seriously I just want to stress that Um
I don't think and I agree with Tony I don't always agree with you Tony but I do
agree You're right This body we we have the power to make these types of it
right like we as as your representatives have the the you know we can all sit
down with our directors we can all be you know push push push push until the things get fixed and it doesn't always
happen overnight right it doesn't always happen fast and you know sometimes it feels like forever but it's it's that
you know and and you have good repres representation here and so uh anyway anyway I just want to say thank you for
having me and uh yeah glad to have you Can I add one more thing thank you Go ahead You want to answer okay Yeah I
just just wanted to comment a couple things Um first and foremost Beth Pittinger she says it best You'll hear
her say uh we are now a big city with a small town police force Did I do that
Justice small town police department for big city problem There you go Okay So so and that's kind of the state that we're
in It really is Um as far as the phone calls go Councilwoman Warwick uh opened up to you know when you go to a station
if nobody's manning our police stations anymore at night which is a scary thing Uh my district we are up in arms We
don't if somebody's rans hacking our car we expect a police officer to be there and take a report And it may be hard for
us to do because of lack of police we have but we still want that We still expect it I still expect it So and and
and we're lucky because we have a really great commander most of you do for this area in Ripple Uh Commander Ripple and
he's also commander for parts of my neighborhoods and he's he's just the best Um the other thing was our best
means of of getting you know this crowds out of off of Grand View and you know
kind of just being too rowdy and causing trouble is this woman right here your council woman I know that she has
stopped many of times on her own and like kicked gangs of kids off of the corner and they scadattleled when she
comes So we all know she's retiring so maybe we can find a job for her as a steady you know enforcer She is an
enforcer trust me up there So uh don't give me a gun and a badge Okay She
doesn't need a gun and a badge That's the beauty about it Okay Thanks That's it for me Thanks Well I'm so embarrassed
You do You kick them off the corner I know you have I also feed the kids and buy them toys
Okay Of course A lot of people have seen the kids run to my car when they see me I'm going to say that They don't run away
from me But um but I do want to thank my colleagues for coming because they've had a busy day today all of our cable
bureau people our staff from the um community engagement office for city council and our sergeant-at-arms who is
a Sheridan resident by the way But okay I said that I hope Okay And so um I just
want to thank all of them for being here and of course our lovely Julie senior center staff Um so thank you all for for
all the work you put in so that we can have these meetings in the evenings to make it more accommodating for the residents and we did get a lot of
requests from residents and it was actually across the city and so I was hoping more people from across the city would be here so it wasn't just my
district but um I am glad that my district came out to share their concerns and some of the concerns that they have but I will say that I do I
want to talk about a few things I think part of um well first let me just say in terms
of the litter I I think I've done what I can as a council person I've picked up litter I've um wrote the anti-litter
campaign you know that whole program Uh started the grass cutting program across
the city of Pittsburgh did the e-recycling program and did all sorts of things to help with that part But I do
think a part of it is an education piece that we're missing And I think our kids I know everybody thinks I'm crazy when I
say this but I think our kids want to do what's right if people give them a chance Part of what our district struggles with is 50% of the kids in
Sheridan are in foster care So half the kids that will be there this year won't be there next year So they're in a transit situation And I think when we
talk about um doing things for the kids we absolutely have to engage the parents
And I think that that's or the or the guardian or whomever they're staying with because a lot of the problems is
that um people don't know each other and and I think communities don't know one another But in Sheridan in particular
I'm going to say I think there is a lot of programs for the kids in there There always has been and or there hasn't
always been I should say but there has been recently We have hope for tomorrow We have Sister Mary has a program We have the boxing program at Langley which
I helped start with um the late Jimmy Sevetic Um we have um Open Fields does
work all over our district and mostly in Craften Heights and um Northw Heights Um
but a lot with uh kids that need that need some direction and um Elliot West End Athletic Association does some stuff
with kids We have a library in Sheridan We have a pool and we do have a park and the park has two mill $2 million for
renovations for the park but it has not been spent yet And as much as council can advocate and as much as we can work
with directors we do not direct the directors So I don't want people to think that we can do something we can't do We do not direct directors That is a
any implementation is up to the administration side not up to council We can say here's the money Here's what we
want you to do We can write legislation but we can't make a director implement that whatever it is that we want I wish
we could sometimes and I try sometimes to make them do it anyway because I do know that we need a lot in our area But
we also have the Steven School building which we're working on That's supposed to be a home for the um Hope for
Tomorrow program Sister Mary's uh resource center the boxing program and
then a community center for the entire region And that has that had $4 million
and we just took a half a half a million out to put in for a playground up in Mount Washington on Shaylor to get that
done too So there's two million this year they're supposed to use for um waterproofing that building uh for the
Stevens school building Um so once that's up and running they'll have some place more places to go and more things
But I try to tell everybody and the kids especially that an absence of something to do is not a reason to commit a crime
because I think we keep making that excuse and it makes kids hear that And I said one of the things in short tier
cities they hold the bar so high I mean they yelled at me once because I brought somebody down with me without telling permission So you know it was like they
were serious They really they hold the bar high And I think part of that is is why their community is so amazing I mean
it's an you know it's one of the safest neighborhoods in the city of Pittsburgh the only predominantly black neighborhood we have in our in our
district And it has the one of the highest home ownerships in the city of Pittsburgh because they hold the bar
high They're really high And I think I give them credit for what they've done It's they've done it not because the city's done it because they've done it
You know the residents have done it So part of that is is that they held expectations um really high for their
kids and I want us to start doing that Yes they do need something to do but there are a lot of things for them to do
and if I keep telling people if having something to do meant kids would be safe Homewood and Sheridan would be some of
the safest neighborhoods because they have some of the most things the other neighborhoods don't have I mean Esland
has they don't have any of those things They have a playground that's it Um you know Westwood has the playground
a school and a ball fields Yeah And Oakwood has a playground And so there's
there's not East Carnegi has a playground So there's a lot of things that our neighborhoods don't have We
only have four pools in our 20 out of 23 neighborhoods So most of them don't have a pool Most of them don't We only have
four libraries The one in Beach I keep remind them is in our district but uh but we only have four
libraries But you know Sheridan has the library Sheran has you know but we have to get them up and running We have to make them usable so the kids can
actually enjoy them When we did the master plan for Sheridan we had more kids attend that process than any other
place in the city I mean it was really nice I want to see them young enough to enjoy that I want to see it happen while
they're still young And I actually talked about it this week actually
Um but I think like when we talk about
um the the commander for zone 3 I think he does the best he can because he's
also balancing between um southside and that's a that's a challenge And he is
putting he did we did put the cameras up You're right we need to know about that He did put in um undercover officers but
you're right we need to know about what's happening We need we asked for a report a couple weeks ago but I'm sure he's probably swamped himself Um and we
um and he's also working actually this new chief is actually working with Commander Ripple to maybe give him back
the cycles and have him put the cycles up there for enforcement So if that happens I think that will address the
issues And I think that's what we need all across our district and all across the city I think a little bit of enforcement with a little bit of
programming and a little bit of education and a little bit of caring all balanced balancing one and us doing our
part with legislation But um and I do think that when we talk about the um
problems with properties they did take out this administration did take out the
um com the residential and just have commercial but we talked about maybe changing that back and and increasing
residential because that's what's ex Sharon's experiencing problems with residential properties and that's what
some of our other neighborhoods are So we'll we'll um move forward with that or look at you know how we can do with that
get that passed with five votes of council And the other thing is that we're also working on no cruising laws
that the commander brought to us saying that that's what he needs for enforcement um in the area So I'm
working with Bob Charlotte on that because it was his it was something he was working on initially
Um but with that said I do think that we have to make sure that we realize that a lot of times policy matters and and if
people are saying that they want to defund the police or they want to do this or they want to do how that affects you does matter and and it there is some
balance there You have to have some balance Um I don't want to see everybody arrested I don't want to see everybody
um walking away free I want to see some balance where we're enforcing laws that you know will be given somebody a chance
We're enforcing the laws and so that you don't become victims because it's not fair to the people that are trying to do
everything right in paying for it a lot of times So I I think that we need to make sure that we're doing a better job
with that And so for my part I'm willing to work on that with my colleagues and and see what we can do to improve those
areas and that stuff But um I do want to say I think with the kids when it comes to the
kids everybody knows the kids are my soft spot I could slap the fire out of an adult but when it comes to the kids I
mean actually I feel badly because so many of the kids are struggling so many ways And um but I think to get the kids
healthy we have to give the adults help So um so I think those are some things that we are still working on and and
things we're trying to work with And there are programs that we try to work through with you know Kesha Gomez as Ebony you know Lunsford every farmer EB
does a great program where she's letting kids come in and learning about farming and um I think it's those are things
that that make a difference and you know really make kids feel important So you didn't come to hear me We really just wanted to come hear you So I'll end it
with that Um is there anything else anybody else wants to add i could just say one other thing Yeah When we talk
about policy um Tony mentioned it Teresa mentioned it Uh one policy we have and
this goes back to Mount Washington and the motorcycles flying up and down Our policy in the Pittsburgh Police
Department is to not chase anybody on a motorcycle a dirt bike where any type of
motor vehicle that's not a car basically Um problem is they know that They know
it now They do And they just blatantly will jump speed whatever They know we're
not going to chase them So whether I'm not for chasing them all the time because it is dangerous It puts other
people in danger It's got to be a better way But uh but but to just come out and blanket and say we're not going to we're
not going to chase anybody on a minibike or a motorcycle or dirt bike it's uh you
know it's it's putting a lot of people at risk and and that's why we have people driving up and down Bronzeville Road They drive up and down on the
sidewalks to go around the traffic 60 m an hour right past the library Uh so you
know that's just one policy thing that needs to be changed I'm working on that with our our public safety director
Whether we chase them or not is irre well it's not irrelevant but the fact that it's known to everybody out there
on a motorcycle on a minibike that we're not going to chase them It's they're laughing at us They really are They're
just like laughing at us and saying well you won't chase me because you're not allowed It's our policy So a lot of things have to change like that That's
just one that is front and center for me that we that I thought of while we were talking So yeah I chase them But
anyway but anyway they need to when they make the laws like that they need to not
use right so I'm just going to add that um I know we need to do some things differently I have voted against the
police budget and I voted against the entire budget this year because I do know that there's some issues and I'm
not going to vote for something that's going to put our area under my council can allocate legislate and advocate
Implementation is up to the administration So I don't want to see council members blame for something that they have no authority to do I mean a
lot of people like to misrepresent what we have our authority to do We all wish we could make them all do what we want
to do because believe me there'd be a lot of things different But um with that said um we do the best we can with by
controlling the budget and control and writing legislation and getting that passed But you need five members to do anything You can't just do it yourself I
wish you know we all wish we could do things by ourselves sometimes But we do have a great team So I want to thank my colleagues and uh with that said um can
I have a motion to adjourn and we can stay and talk
oh motion to second meeting adjourned Thank you everyone Thank you Heat Heat
