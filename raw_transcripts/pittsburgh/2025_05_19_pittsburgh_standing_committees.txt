official action or deliberation which are may or may be before city council and profanity will not be permitted
please state your name and neighborhood for the record you will have three minutes to speak and our first and only
registered speaker is Dr ronald Len
Miller dr ronald and Miller um Lawrenville i really love the nook on
Butler invite you all to visit it it's very busy very welcoming even though you
have to go online to get most of your information very very nice town uh you counselor uh claimments um are very
focused on the vote with good reason there is a primary election tomorrow um
the vote is the core of the US American Republican democracy that doesn't mean parties it
means institutions um but we citizens um are not in control of our votes so the the
vote is the central US American freedom of speech action uh but no voter in any
election in the United States of America as far as we know um can check um the
voting record to make sure that his or her vote or their vote um has been misplaced lost or misapplied leeched
over to someone else that you didn't vote for um you can claim it that's what
I mean by claim it but you can't prove it um no one in this room can prove that
you voted for yourself in any election in Alageney County
um so I and the Global Intelligence Society my colleagues uh have asked more
than 1,000 people in Pittsburgh City across nine districts all nine districts
and more than 10,000 across the United States country uh three questions to begin with for people that are willing
uh to uh engage um of all racial backgrounds ethnic backgrounds and so on
uh one do you want your vote to be misplaced or lost answer universally is no uh second question do you want your
vote to be misapplied uh to somebody else answer is again universally no and
number three um can you check to make sure that your vote has not been misapplied um or
misplaced and the answer is universally in all more than 3,200 counties or
county equivalents in the United States answer is no i think this is an egregious breach of u our right uh to
freedom of speech under the US constitution amendment one this is why
um my 2028 president uh effort um has
initiative one which is vote by voter verification for whom um the county here
will allow you to check that you voted but not for whom and that that is to get this US Supreme Court to rule that a
citizen must have access to the vote record to ensure that his or her vote
has not been misplaced gone or misapplied gone over to someone else
thank you very much there being no further registered speakers we will now take comments from those in the audience
wishing to speak
my name is Javon F brown i live at 715 Mercer Street that's in Katie World
Tires up on um Beford Avenue i repeatedly came down here and told you
that we have a domestic terrorist a woman that is that comes into the
building to beat the mother and daughter with the hammer it just beat another resident a little a man that was
kind of heavy and I looked he says just small as me and I said "What kind of diet are you on?" And he said "Cancer."
This man has cancer he was standing and talking to another resident and this
woman Rashidita McKinley walks down the hill goes up under the tree and gets a
branch and comes while this man is talking to one of the residents and
whacks him in his head just starts beating him in and he said "Why are you doing this to me?" Well I go to the
manager because I'm upset when they tell me and she says "Oh he has to go to we can't do nothing he must go to the
police." And I'm saying if you got cameras and she's been banned since
2020 2022 i went up me and my daughter about her messing with me and some of
the other people this is 25 she's still chasing me when I go to the manager and
say that I'm afraid she said "Don't say that." I said "She's saying things to me." She put her big breast up in the
ear she don't talk to me like that but some weeks later they heard somebody say
"What did you say to my mother?" had her some scaffling and that was her rashidita McKinley had our manager by
her neck but she's thinner now the manager threw her down they were wrestling on the floor and she was
saying "Get her off of me get her off of me." The manager said "I did not hit her all I was doing is reprimanding her."
Well no she said restraining i'm sorry restraining well I sweeped down in the building i've been doing it for years
and the manager came in and I said to her um when I told you that I was afraid
for my life and told you that this woman is um bother me you told me that she
don't talk to you like that i said but she'll grab you by your neck and she said "Oh no oh no." But there is
witnesses these are the citizens that told me they saw them and one woman was
sitting there and Rashita came out and told us called her all them called all them old women old bees and how she's
going to get us going to do this one to this going do this and that i'm trying to explain to you that when we when I
first came down here we came because we had no security we didn't even mention her then we got security oh it's been a
while we had security well the the Wit Watson our county councilman was in
there talking and I was sitting there and he was bragging about what he did and I said "We don't even have a bus."
And he turned around and he he started swimming he said "I put your ass out of

what a gentleman what a gentleman
introduce yourselves yeah sure my name is Fiona Kelman i'm the DBA for police
marty Devine the acting chief okay well thank you um for being here i had
questions on a couple of these things so I figured you know there's two or three in front of us but but the um Department of Public enter an agreement with theft
prevention agency for the purpose of receiving grant funds theft do you know what this is um what this actually goes
into what the fund goes into there is actually an honor squad um we have a
fund that's set up yeah um over the last how many years it was going into
um the same fund and when uh we had the audit and I met with um the grants department for this year we realized
your microphone a little closer oh sorry um when we had the audit earlier this
year and then I met with the grants department we realized that a new fund number should have been established and
so this is kind of going back doing our checks and balances realizing that we need to get a new fund uh what what does
auto Theft prevention agency do do you know i mean what do they So it's uh it's
supported by the insurance companies so we receive money which pays for one of our the salary of one of our detectives
pays for overtime pays for equipment pays for vehicles oh okay so this is not like
some something in black and white says uh don't leave your car unlocked no right okay gotcha all right all right
that's it for me as far as this one goes anybody else that's I have questions yeah councilwoman Kale Smith thank you i I know that Joey Kenya was there and
Joey grew up in my neighborhood so I know and you had received a grant for
this and you weren't paying people with that grant this is before your time so I'm going let you slide i'm going to let
you slide did you get it straightened out because if you didn't I don't want to vote for enough grant i don't want to vote for more money to go into a pot
that we don't see results from that's what So I want to know what what's being used and and what happened with the last
one yeah so uh we had a meeting with the um the uh the people that oversee the
grant and they had concerns too because um they weren't spending it no no no but
it was So yeah so it was sitting there so if you don't use it you lose it and uh we promised to uh to staff that unit
to their specifications and um we just So we had
so after Kenya left we had detailed a couple detectives down there to help out to help are they here no they're not
here okay and uh since then we transferred um another detective down there so we have two and we're in the
process we now have two detectives yeah we're in the process of And what happened with that grant money from that the previous grant did you pay for
something because Joey Kenya left because you weren't hiring people and the money wasn't being used for the auto
squad no yeah so when he left we he became a civilian and has makes more money and is happy as can be and they
left Pittsburgh police that's a that's a sad statement to me don't give him any ideas it was a sad statement to me that
you know somebody leaves here and they're just so much happier and so we failed to do our responsibility in order
right so after he had left that that left us So after he left that le left us down to
one detective and then uh we filled it via um detailing officer who was the
detective when he left it was uh Derek um
Quint thank you detective at the time Joe was there by himself kun was
helping out on the firing range and then after uh Joe had left Derek Kun had uh
come back and then we had somebody working with him i think I just say the administration's
probably happy they sent you over here today because I'm was waiting for this to come before us um but I do appreciate
that you are trying to straighten a lot of things out and I think I wish that we had had you in place for the last three
years because I see the work that you're doing and I see what how you respect the officers and that means a lot to us
contrary to what everybody thinks we didn't chase anybody away but I know people like to say that's the
fact but the reality is I have my text messages that prove otherwise so with that said I will say thank you for your
work and thank you to the officers for their work and thank you for your work i'm sorry that that there's such a
challenging time right now in the city of Pittsburgh for the police and for various departments thank you thank you
thank you Council Member Warwick um yeah thanks i just wanted to quickly
ask so I know that this may not be you know um specifically for this amount of funding
but I wanted to ask about um um abandoned vehicles uh cuz I you
know I I I know in in in my zone in zone 4 I I believe we have one officer and I
just want to I I I know there's some issues with storage and whatnot we just we do get a lot of calls about abandoned
vehicles and and I understand that it takes but it's sort of a complicated process and um if if there's
any uh if you have any thoughts about what you know what can be done to kind
of make this a faster process or or what the what the um what sort of the the
pain points are around getting you know getting vehicles abandoned vehicles towed um and and I know too I've also
had situations with like boats you know larger vehicles boats trailers that type of thing so boats are a little bit of a
trickier issue however to answer your question regarding the abandoned vehicles um in the very near future u I
have a plan to have a banned vehicle blitz where we're going to hit each zone
and try to clean up as many um abandoned vehicles as possible
oh that's great can we uh can we send you cuz you know we I I
have a long we have a long list between myself getting calls and also the office um you know we have a whole long list
should we send that to you or should we send it to our commander you could send it to your commander that was part of
the plan we're going to uh get a list from each zone to find out which try to prioritize which vehicles need removed
uh sooner rather than later I should say and um we're gonna we're planning on
taking that approach okay great and I had again you know you hear things and I you know just is do we
have is is there still or was there an issue with where to where to put the vehicles when once they're removed i
thought maybe there might be an issue with storage space no that's uh so the vehicles are removed they're abandoned
they're they're taken by a seller who and we have uh there's a couple I think each zone has their own and then they
take them to their own uh storage facility okay all right well that sounds good
thank you very much that's uh that's good news i'm glad to hear it thank you you're welcome thank you any further
discussion second round councilman um what's your name kong Hill
um yes so uh first of all I love the idea about the blitz yeah me too feel like we're back on the football field
and I and I Marty and I go way back we're old friends and I agree with Council Muel Smith as to the morale of
the department and I'm not just saying it because I'm biased honestly Marty you know I've known you for a long time and
I know you know how to treat people you're fair and you're honest and uh no I appreciate um the progress that you've
made in the short time that you've made it just a just a rank and foul it's just really really great not to be my phone
not ringing off the hook because complaints about our acting chief so it's good um I love the blitz uh you
know um Ripple's really good at removing vehicles I guess so the uh the ve or the
the traffic unit was moved back to him effective today oh so we'll be able to take care the problem that we had that
includes the motorcycles is there I'll skip second round that's includes the motorcycles is that right is that part of the motorcycles yeah right the entire
truck you know no no I deal good deal good deal you know the horses are coming out on Memorial Day for me the last
their last I think we'll work on that as city employees I should say their last parade but uh so okay that's it for me
Madam Chair thanks Councilwoman Kale Smith i'm going to bring the horses up for the next bill okay but for this one
I just want to say I love the idea of the blitz and and I in our area the fifth division has a lot of boats you
know and that they they were storing the boats from across the city there and it was c starting to cause a landslide right that right there's an issue with
the storage of the boats yeah so I just I want us to be mindful of where like what we're doing and where we're putting them and I want us to start in you know
order of districts not nine backwards but you know it' be nice they started one two three we'll get it figured out
just Thank you you're welcome thank you thank you but let's do alphabetical order like we do our voting yeah when
I'm gone they'll start everything will be district two first any further discussion i just had one
question this is a question that was one of those ideas that come up from constituents and now is the time to ask
it I think because um uh I hadn't gotten a chance to before now it was an idea that acknowledging that some makes and
models are more susceptible to break-ins than others to figure out a way to
somehow um I don't know if we even have record of that or working with PENDOT to alert those drivers to their
susceptibility of breakins because of the the the make or the model of their car um would we ever do anything like
that or more general PSAs i believe we did i believe uh when Chief Scarado was here we put out a public safety
announcement there's two types of vehicles that are more susceptible to being stolen others they're Hyandai
and the uh Kia right and I know that we had talked and I believe had moved forward on uh providing clubs the old
club input steering older people remember the clubs uh handing those out and I believe that happened uh under um
Chief Gado and there was just talk about doing that again recently okay great i'll pass this along to the residents
and then I I can have the uh PIO's put out another public safety great we'll look we'll look out for that okay and we
never work with the like the the scrapyards or the owners of the folks who take that to sort of uh I don't know
is there any way is there any work that we do with them directly to be on the lookout for that particular type so most
of the vehicles that are being stolen now nowadays are stolen by juveniles for joy for joy riding yeah and
uh as far as like a I think you're referring to maybe like a chop shop where a car was stolen since I've been
here um almost 26 years i've never It's not where the where it's right it
doesn't occur much or at all in city of Pittsburgh so we're fortunate as far as that okay thank you very much any
further discussion seeing none all those in favor of bill 1821 please indicate by
saying I i affirmative recommendation bill 1822 bill 1822 resolution
authorizing the mayor and the director of public safety to enter on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh into an agreement
or agreements with Vanderhos Gild German Shepherds Inc for the purchase of canines for the Bureau of Police at a
cost not to exceed $30,000 over three years motion to approve brief discussion
second second with discussion council um I guess my Yeah
bring up whoever you want experts canines right they don't bite do they no it's my muscle guess a little he is
muscle i think I can take him so I don't think he's intimidating me the questions got a little too hard i
was going to go like this look at my backup he's mine too that's right that's
right you introduce yourself would you i am Kyle Nelson Sergeant of Special
Deployment Division i'm overseer of the K9's EOD um river rescue and the mounted patrol
for now oh so responsive the mount of patrol for now did you hear that makes a
tear to my eyes kyle sorry it's not a tear in mind but we're going to keep them kids so Kyle it says uh how many
Kines do we have right now um for the easy answer is 15 um we have a
electronic deployment dog that does hard drives and telephones things like that
we have a blood hound then we have five narcotics dogs and six explosive
dogs yeah and they're out on the street every day every day is that right available on call if there's nobody
there on the street 24 hours robotic dog is not a robot right is that what you said did you say uh robotic dog what did
you say um your No one of our our first K9 is he uh does electronics detection
so if you have a cell phone that gets discarded he can find the cell phone in in the middle of a field yeah oh okay yeah right missing person or something
right no for the missing persons we would use a blood hound um the electronics detection dog is used mostly by the FBI for um somebody throws
a phone commits a crime throws a phone or something you know for a lack of a better term it's for child porn so if
you have a hard drive that you want to hide inside your house inside the walls or if they a lot of times they'll bury you in the backyard we bring in our
electronics detection dog and he will find the hard drive okay so it says 30,000 for K9's is that how much how
much are they are we buying to replace a canine to buy them from the breeder is approximately $9,500 so okay so it buys
three it buys three over a three-year period we typically don't need to replace them that often um I I'm not
sure where that money or that distinction of funds came from but it
would not exceed 30,000 over three years I don't believe got it got it yeah um that's that's it for me Madam Chair
that's Thank you thank you Cal councilwoman Kale Smith thank you um so I see that
we're well I was initially worried i'm thinking okay we're doing the canines but I saw the canines at some events
with kids and I loved watching how the kids were first real hesitant to go over
to the dog and then all of a sudden they were like really you know loving the animal and and the dog at the time and
um who doesn't like dogs something anyway don't buy time like
that and but here's the thing they love the horses it's true and they absolutely love those horses i And I'm going to be
honest when I see them I'm thinking "Somebody clean up after those things." But the kids love them and when I see
kids in Sheridan running to police instead of away or instead of yelling at them like they a lot of times the kids
are throwing rocks cops come down I send the cops home so I can take care of the kids because the the craziness that
incurs they don't run towards police but when they have when you have those horses and the dogs and the cycles kids
are running towards cops and to me there is no better me money spent than seeing
kids building that relationship and cops building that relationship with the young people in the in the in the community and especially in
neighborhoods where sometimes there's a little bit of tension and for me in one
of my neighborhoods that there's a lot of tent is when I go to Sheridan I mean I told you people call me so that
there's not tension between the kids and the cops and I it's just a great thing so I think we should do whatever we can
to keep those horses not because I want them because the kids love them and I think I mean they if they matter so much
and we're talking so much about building police community relations and doing all these things to build relationships and having you know um social workers go
with kids and doing all I mean to me they are therapeutic in some ways for some people and I just think we need to
do a better job at figuring out how we're going to do this but I think it's incumbent upon us we have a little bit of time left to figure out what we can
do um Give us a week
thank you thank you any further discussion seeing none all those in
favor of bill 1822 please indicate by saying I i i affirmative recommendation
bill 1823 bill 1823 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director
of public safety to enter on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh into an agreement or agreements with Bronner Group K9
Services LLC for the purchase of canines for the Bureau of Police at a cost not
to exceed $30,000 over three years a motion to approve brief discussion
second with discussion again K9's but different company is that right yes sir the uh Vanderhouse Gill Company is in
Ohio practically almost in Indiana um the Browner Group is in West Virginia it's about a 2 and a half hour drive we
just have them so that we have competing and we have different options for the dogs in case one doesn't have any dogs
that are appropriate for us we can go and try the other breeder got it got it um
uh yeah that's that's it for me that's good that's what I figured just briefly council I was just going to say that
we're going to So we're purchasing possible six dogs over three years is that right no again this we will only we
typically only purchase maybe one or maybe one or two a year um
it it all depends on the age and the uh suitability of the canines that we have working as they age out we replace them
we don't add any more people to the unit yeah right now we have two that are available that we're hoping to put on in the fall but other than that it's it's
got purchase them as you need yeah we as needed but this is putting the funds there so we could Right yeah got it okay
thank you yeah counciloman K just briefly there was an RFP for both of these correct yeah there's an RFP and I
have it in front of me if you want to review it yeah Lisa thank you thank you
thank you Council President Lel just a quick question um thank you i had actually never heard of an electronic
sniffing dog so I looked it up and it's actually pretty fascinating what they can do um but it also talks about the
handler getting special training as well so I'm just curious do we have enough handlers do we have enough handlers i'll
always take more that's the short answer um right now we we have two um two two spaces available
I believe one for a narcotics dog and another one for another explosives dog so we're hoping to fill those positions
in the fall uh but again it it comes down to whether we can afford people from the zones if we can add these
positions whether we can get the funding for the dogs which thank you very much it looks like we're going to have the funding for them but you know we'll I'll
always take more okay
