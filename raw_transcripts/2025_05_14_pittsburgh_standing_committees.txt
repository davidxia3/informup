Special Agents
Good morning special agents uh sunshine A little discombobulated this
morning after yesterday's meeting and
discoveries about this diplomat who's out here raping one
of his employees I didn't mention mention his name but I will now Kareem
Khan chief prosecutor and diplomat of the International Criminal
Court Imagine that He's raping one of his employees Has done it repeatedly for
months and they know about it and are protecting him because they think his
position as a diplomat is more important than his position as a prosecutor
Really i praise God I'm not near him I remove his head in Jesus name with all
the love in my heart That's what I would do to him Lord please return a cinder's curse
sent towards me 100 million billion children Google and whoever is sending
it Lord please throw them into a lake of fire We need to count our
blessings Thank you Lord I'm not this woman that this diplomat is raping But
to her I will say to you Exodus 14:14 says "The Lord will
fight for you You need only to be still Cuz that's what I have to be for him to
fight all of you who know about what's going on with me
Why when how everybody involved where everything is that belongs to me that
has my real name on it God blesses us so that we might bless
others In spite of everything that's happened to me still happening to me I
will continue to fight to be a blessing Psalm 101 103 1-4 says "Bless the Lord
oh my soul and all that is within me Bless his holy name and forget not not all his benefits
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities who health all thine diseases who crowneth
thee with loving kindness and tender mercies Dear God thank you for being for
your blessings Please help me to remember the ways you have blessed my life when it seems to overwhelm me I'm a
little overwhelmed but I'll be okay So this woman I will stand for her and
for every woman that's being raped by anybody regardless of their position all over the
world I'm a a product maybe I may be a product of incest in my
family But I will never live in guilt fear or shame in Jesus name Amen
Thank you Next speaker please

been programmed Now let me give you the story about Leroy Irvvis when he went
left Pittsburgh and he went to uh to be at the Capitol in Harrisburg be a state
representative and the influence of his seed was planted for four state
representatives to resurrect and come back to Pittsburgh to unseegregate the
system and what it is I always loved the Ed Gayy administration and then until I
found out it was segregated And you know what i was at a rally a couple months ago and we was out
in Squirrel Hill and we were protesting Republicans What Trump has shook up the
world with Shook up the world you know
government veterans for what I represent The disappointment is the
segregation And you find out this someone is running against our
mayor and getting Trump money Republican money And you know what we already done
been assumed with fear in Pittsburgh blinders of the Mississippi attitude of
Woodro Wilson Jagger Hoover But
Pittsburgh Pittsburgh's been segregated from the time I was growing up from I was 12 years old I just turned
72 May the 3rd Let me get you give you a point of what I done witnessed in
Pittsburgh and you grew up in Pittsburgh and you still got blinders on to
segregate this city again I don't want to go back 60 years You know what i love
the run and mate I've watched him grow up that's going against our mayor but
it's a disappointment to find out the funding I'm not here to see anybody buy
a campaign but I'm here about human rights Human rights I live in
Wilkinsburg but I can't vote in Pittsburgh because of my situation of being
handicapped But you know what the disappointment is you got to go ahead and take off

North Pole Thank you very much Thank you

Yes please Hi This is Council Yes Can you hear me yes Counciloman Sorry I am
um just had a meeting with Demi yesterday afternoon So I apologize to Councilman Mosley the chair of the
committee My staff has a draft of an amendment Um and I'll explain that the
way it reads now the legislative text makes it sound like we are giving
permission to donate the steps that we own and we're going to rebuild to Port
Authority and that is not the intent So there's a couple of quick strikeouts
that I apologize we didn't get to you today um that we agreed with about
because what's going to happen is the Downing Street steps uh were closed and are gone We're going to rebuild them but
we're going to um flip them to face downhill and encroach like 2 feet onto
Port Authority property And so this legislative text is intended to create
just a two or three foot easement with the port authority So once we get a second look

Bill 1798 resolution providing for a reimbursement agreement or agreements with the Pittsburgh Water for costs
associated with the Liberty Avenue HSIP project where Pittsburgh Water will be responsible for paying 100% of the
actual expenses involved in certain work to be described in the agreements
Motion to approve Second discussion Discussion Councilman Wilson Yeah I was just curious because there's uh several
bills here three and I believe they're all either in my district and shared with other people that are representing
the other side of the street as well I'm just trying to get a handle on what a bill like this means Anyone here to
speak to this
Kim Lucas
Good morning Kim Lucas uh director for the city of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure So um the
bills that you're referencing today where we are entering into agreements with utility companies when the city has
a project and a utility has their asset in our right of way they're required to accommodate our project Sometimes it's
more efficient for our construction crews that we're hiring to do that work
and just pass along the cost to the utility company instead of having two essentially separate projects go in the
same place where they get in do their work and then we get in We just cover the actual construction but they're as
you see here responsible for 100% of the costs of incorporating that work into our contract And the agreements are
required by PENDOT for these uh projects that have grant funding within them Like
what type of work are we talking about um sometimes this is utility relocations sometimes it's you know just improvement
to their infrastructure You know when the BRT was coming through even though that's not our project we requested the
utilities go in and do a betterment project so that we weren't working with PRT to install this great new
infrastructure just to have something underground fail and have to tear it out So this is sort of the height of
coordination with utility companies to make sure that we're not disrupting the right of way more more than we So if
they see a mainline that they let's say the um the water company they see a mainline that they have uh on scheduled
to be replaced in 5 years they would replace it now You know that's probably a case by case basis That would be the
ideal if they're able to and we identify that as a potential conflict Um but each
of these projects is a case- by case negotiation once you find out what's underground when you get into the design
work Okay And
they're like the other entities are on board with this because I saw Dukane Light as well and previously Yeah I mean
they're required to when you have your assets in our right of way you're required to do what you need to do with
those assets If we if the city has a project coming through that will what level of when you say required to like
what's the um threshold that they would be required to now you're getting outside my knowledge base so I'll have
to follow up with you on that just saying I think it's a like when we if we need them to relocate we can make them
relocate is my understanding interesting what we need uh one thing we
need on Liberty Avenue is is there's this one uh this is very is a very Pittsburgh
thing for me to do here which is to to pick out one part of the street and complain about it Uh there is a riser
that's needed um uh you know it's the section between
16th and coming towards town and uh I just feel I almost want to see how many
car accidents or missed accidents almost happen because it's like you go down and up you know you can't avoid hitting the
you know your tire hitting it Mhm So it's just seeing how like when you pave the road it road continually getting
stacked up Mhm You know continually gets higher so they have to put a new riser on the manhole Okay Oh I see what you're
saying Okay Um I can certainly have our uh utility folks take a look at it I'm
sure But that section of Liberty is that in the project let's see For that would
be 16th going towards the bus station So from 11th Street to Heron Avenue So it
would Okay great All right Looking forward to the project Thanks
You any further discussion seeing none all those in favor of bill
1798 please indicate by saying I I Affirmative recommendation bill 1799
