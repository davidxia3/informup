good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's Cablecast Post agenda on the 2024 annual con comprehensive
financial report this is for May 15 2025 and for the record today we're
joined by council members Wilson Charlotte and Warwick thank you for being here others might um join us as
the post agenda hearing proceeds and we have some invited guests from Controller Rachel Heistler's office if you'd like
to I'll I'll open up in just a few minutes to introduce yourselves and to present um your findings from the report
um summarized for us before we get into some questions and answers from council members i just wanted to say and I don't
want to steal any thunder from the controller but what we had talked about um I think you know more than a year ago
was u especially now as as I'm sitting here as finance and law chair to um get
into a regular rhythm with um not just sending a comprehensive financial report
or you know in some cases quarterly reports to council for consumption at
our own pace at our own speed but also ensuring that the public is aware that we're actually really daylighting the
work that's being done and getting into a regular rhythm for that so um more
people are aware aware of the conversations that we might be having internally and more uh more eyes are on
this um this work that's done um this incredible work that's done every year and perhaps even more frequently than
that so with those sort of brief opening remarks I'm happy to turn it over to our
our city controller Rachel Heistler
thank you council person um so I'm just going to briefly I'm joined today at the table by my colleagues uh Andrew Dit
who's our special projects manager Jamie Zala CPA who's our chief accounting officer and Amita uh Drakawarth who's
our solicitor sorry she does a lot of things but that is her title um and so
I'm just going to explain what the annual comprehensive financial report is it is the financial report of record for
the city of Pittsburgh thousands of hours go into the annual production of this um which is handled primarily by um
chief accounting officer Zala and it is a summary of all money in and all money
out um and and of all accounts that the city um either has control of or of our
component units so the financials from the URA um sea PWSA and the parking
authority are all included um in various part parts of this report um I'll just
briefly give some highle numbers if any of my colleagues want to chime in as well please feel free um but we 2024 was
a good year for the city right um we are concerned moving forward but as we um
highlighted when I uh started in this position last spring um there are
concerning trends moving forward but 2024 overall um was a decent year um we
brought in 7.1 million more than it's spent um that's in on a gap basis which if anybody has questions about gap find
gap numbers versus operating Jaime's the person to answer them um it was an
increase of 25.6 million again these are gap figures the day-to-day figures the
which is how the city operates uh on a cash base basis we collected 703.6
million and spent 699.7 million those figures do not include transfers out so
the $10 million we sent to the URA for the housing opportunity fund the money that's transferred to the stop of violence fund those are not included um
because transfers out are not budgeted um some bright really bright spots in
the revenue on the revenue side of things um our investment earnings were exceptional we ra we brought in $28
million in investment earnings i think everybody would be in agreement that those figures are un very unlikely in
2025 if you look at the historical average we brought in between two and $2.5 million a year in investment
earnings um a lot of that is attributable to the um treasurer Gula and her team who
invests the fund balance um and they have done an exceptional job um other
we've rebounded from the pandemic in terms of amusement taxes and parking taxes
um deed transfer is a concerning spot so it's we have the highest deed transfer
tax in the country at 5% um and we fell short of budget by 11.2 million and
finished the year at 47.9 million it's down that was down from an all-time high in 65.4 million um real estate again
this is not a surprise to anybody um we finished the year at 143.4 million which
is 8.2 million under budget um this is a 5.6 $6 million decrease from 2023 and
down from an all-time high of 153 million in 2022 we issued 33 million in
refunds um which does not include the voided refunds um LST the local services
tax that's at 522 that we collect on people who commute in um we finished at
13.5 million in 2023 and 13.7 million in 2024 which was under budget um payroll
prep 7 75.8 million which is uh 3.9 million more than we collected in 2023
um these figures collectively represent um a generally
stable but job create let me rephrase that they it explains to us that the job
market is stable but job creation remains slow um so facility usage fee
we're all on the same page with that we don't know if it's going to be an income or revenue that we can bring in um after
the Supreme Court reviews and um determines what they're going to do with
that um most of our money most of city revenue more than half comes directly
from city residents in the form of real estate taxes and wage taxes um that is a
concerning point for me um because I think that it's you know we need to make sure we're diversifying revenue and that
the burden of city government isn't falling exclusively on the shoulders of the people who live and work here um
money goes to public safety an overwhelming majority um highway and
streets is also a significant part and then general governments at about a quarter the unassigned fund balance grew
considerably in 2023 expanded by about $25 million last year was effectively
stagnant we only added a million dollars to the general fund as I've mentioned we're expend expected to um spend more
thanund I think 120 million 130 million um from the fund balance over the course
of the next five years um with that I'm happy to if any
of my colleagues have anything they'd like to add and I'm happy to open it up for questions i don't want to go through and go line by line unless people want
me to do that because it can get confusing with numbers no wait for questions we'll wait for
questions okay thank you well I will um I'll I'll start
with questions from other council members and if anyone has questions
they'd like to go first we can do it that way otherwise I can start from the end of the table and kind of work this way but all good council member Warwick
do you any questions off the top of your head we can also have several rounds
so Could you walk us through like the
process who all is involved in creating i'll turn that over to to Jamie for the
nuts and bolts of it uh so it's really a kind of whole building does my team is
the one that more puts a lot of this together we do a lot of entries we work pretty closely with uh Maradus who are
our external auditors because while we're doing this we're also being audited so these are all audited
numbers uh but my office we reach out
to a lot of other departments within the city to get the information that we need
to make the entries that we need to do like uh we said this moves from our day-to-day cash basis into a modified
acrruel which is required for the acter for the audit which is basically
changing it for timing purposes moving some buckets around for um accounting
principles
yes what is so there's um a couple different parts and this is this also
goes along with it being part of an audit um so they're also working with our
external auditors where they're asking for documentation but for some of it
there are pages within here that is um put together by OM
so I think it is how much I look at this I know pretty much right Where to turn
pages 9 through 12 are uh reports i generate
them in my uh program and I send off to OMB for them to verify change anything
they need to change for this is the actuals to budget um are for some of
those uh real estate we work closely with
because we need to get certain reports for us to make any entries to do
uncollectible amounts there there's a couple different things in order for us to make certain
entries i need to get information from other departments to do to do so okay
i'll just add every city department has something in this book okay um and that
includes our component units as well i mean everybody has we've heard we've
gently reminded um multiple times through the first quarter of the year hey we need these figures we need these
figures we need these figures and I just can't overstate how cooperative everybody is through this process um
it's a lot of work and it requires a lot of manh hours from our team in particular but from everybody in OM and
finance in particular I think it probably weighs the most heavily on um and we have robust cooperation
from all the other departments okay um can you explain for me a little just so
I can understand is the the cash in the general fund so
you said that it was around 200 we have 100 yeah we have $199 million in the uh
rainy day fund the fund balance okay that is the balance
okay does that all So I What is it normally is that I just
Excuse me it's very high it's very high and very healthy right now okay uh government GFOA the GFOA recommends a
10% balance uh 10% of expenditures and that's the unassigned fund balance so
money that is sitting waiting is that's encumbered is not included in that amount of money okay okay so like
projects that are rolling over from year to year that wouldn't be included it's the unassigned balance it's money that's available to be spent okay so that so so
the rainy day fund is good then yes yes okay so the concerning part is the trajectory forward and just how much
we're going to weigh or how much we we will rely on that for general operating between now and the end of 2029 and the
budget right now will get us to that 10% at the end of 2029 okay so Okay so so
you're so you so it's good now you're just worried about Yeah and the trend
going forward or Yeah yeah yeah the annual the reliance on it because once you hit that 10% in at the end of 2029
if you're not you know doing anything for cost control or doing anything to grow revenue you're going to continue to
spend down the fund balance so we just need in my Does that make sense like we're spending operating out of the fund
balance you're we're budgeted to do that year-over-year for the next 5 years and my concern is if we can't figure out how
to increase revenue or control costs that that trend will continue and we
will spend down the fund balance okay um All right
um I think that's all my questions for now but I'll probably have more as we go along sure yeah thanks Council Person
Charl all right uh thank you for being here and uh you know I appreciate all of
your guidance from from all of you all throughout the year um you're a invaluable resource to to me in my
office so cannot appreciate you enough uh I want to start off so you mentioned
uh that the that 2024 was a strong year and that
you know from what you're seeing you're see the tone is that you sound like it's happy and and I would like you to expand
on that a little bit yeah so 2024 finished where we thought it would right and the concerning year was never 2024
and I' as I've stated numerous times if you're sounding the alarm while you're in the middle of a crisis you didn't you
didn't you know prepare appropriately the most concerning years are 25 and 26
where these um bond payments are going to balloon um we have a steep cliff with
I mean we put 40 let's get to that in a second but let let's talk about 2024 for right now okay
so what is it on on 2024 that that you are like what are what are some happy
spots what are some happy highlights yeah so are we've rebounded from the pandemic which was primar we primarily
noticed in um the amusement tax and parking both finished above budget um we
for me I am thrilled and I I mean the investment earnings are just remarkable
and I want to again credit uh treasurer Gula and her team they
they strategy behind that was I mean it's just it's really remarkable um so
for me yes we finished the year basically where we thought we would um $45 million of our um operating
budget came from the American Rescue Plan Act so that's money that we can't rely on moving forward um I do think
it's unrealistic to assume that um investment earnings will continue on on that level too um but those were were
bright spots um you know we are not losing
um the LST and payroll prep being steady is you know better than them not um so
those are encouraging numbers um EIT our wage tax is again finished uh um over
budget and but only slightly so those are the places that I I'm happy about
the trends are what I'm most concerned about moving forward sure so uh one of
the things that we we hear about a lot is uh a $4 million surplus from
2024 can you tell me what a $4 million surplus in 2024 means
so I what I will tell you is um
we trying to think of the best way we the $4 million surplus does not include
the transfers out um because they're not on the on budget so we our operating
fund had a $4 million surplus that is accurate um but that surplus does not
include um the transfers that we make to the housing opportunity fund um the stop
the violence fund the $2.5 million that go to the URA for the housing housing
bond um I forget what else there was this year but those numbers are not included in that figure and I I don't
have the uh cover sheet in front of me i should have prepared with that what how
much do we spend in transfers every year or we don't How much do we transfer in transfers um I think the number in 2024
was at least 25 million isn't it
well it also includes whatever payo so I believe what was budgeted for 2024 and
this was from earlier presentations was about 22 million that went to PIGO I
believe no just PGO yes just PGO and then the rest was right there was a
small balance for early childhood um and then there was the last for a
tech modernization as well this is the last year we're doing that is that right correct and
that ends up I again I don't have in front of me about 50 million something like that is it right ballpark okay so
the $4 million surplus is before the the trans the $50 million transfers yes yes
so that overall expenses were less than what we brought in collected yeah i just
think that's an important clarification that correct gets gets missed a lot um and the the nuance of this is you know
it's why we've got people like like you to be able to help us understand this so
let's talk a little bit about uh this year the current year that we're in not necessarily the trends that we're going
to see but this this year so far you know as you're looking at last year's
numbers um as we've we've worked on making sure that that the uh
controllers's office has the opportunity to certify revenues what What are you seeing this
year that is uh you know peing your interest
um I'll start out and then I please feel free to to uh uh share your thoughts too
um we are expecting that tax revenue will be down significantly below budget in 2025 payroll prep being the most
notable variance um the local services tax was down 12 and a half% from Q1 of
2024 and payroll prep was down 16% um I think
we I don't know that anybody could have accounted for the volatility in the markets and the tariffs and the way that
that's going to increase costs um but again our office doesn't certify expenditures we certify revenues so just
to be a point of clarification on that um deed transfer continues to be down
again a lot of that is the economic indicators that are happening on the macro level so you know if the economy
slows it's much less likely that people are going to buy and sell homes and as I mentioned that fell below budget in 2024
the all-time high I think was above 60 million in 2022 so um as it relates to
revenue I think that there are things that are are macro like on like on the
you know big picture level that we should be very weary about um
and I I believe that when we made our revenue uh certific revenue projection certification in August and then again
um later in the year because a couple numbers had changed i believe that they were accurate i do think the national
financial picture is changing and that will have significant consequences on
city revenue in 2025 and probably into 2026 as well
so one concerning thing that I I noticed is that um I'm not sure if I believe
this will be the first year that this happens but it will certainly happen next year that uh we will gain more of
our revenue from uh earned income taxes than we will off of property taxes um I
I believe this year that if I'm correct the numbers are very close next year it should uh earn income should uh take
over property taxes i see that as a a pretty concerning trend for a city of our
size how what does that mean uh you know for the controllers's office what do you
do you think uh that that what story does that tell
i my worry with um well the first thing I'll just say is that we need a
countywide reassessment um and we need to stabilize real estate and in for the
city of Pittsburgh but also for all the other municipalities um it makes it very
difficult to plan and I recognize the challenges with that but I just I as a
point I think that that needs to be said um wage taxes are stable um which is
good news i am 25% of our taxable real estate in the city of Pittsburgh comes
from downtown that property is worth less than it was five years ago we you know this is not news um I want to make
sure that we aren't pricing people out of neighborhoods and homes and properties that they've lived in for
decades um particularly folks who have stayed here so that's you know something that I think we need to mitigate against
but I for me I am are with wage taxes where they are to
me they dictate that our local economy is stable um but it and people are
probably earning a little bit more money um but I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to expand that pool of
people who maybe don't own a house here but work in the city and live in the strip district live in Greenfield live
in Hazlewood um so that's what I'll offer on that commentary i don't know if
Nimita or anyone else has i mean part of this report and part of
I'd say the goal you know of of what the controllers's office is is as we're
continually monitoring city finances is to remain independent and objective
um you know it it's not big news in in the country that costs are rising
significantly and a lot of people aren't baking as much
to to accept all of those things and you know as as far as
um you know even with the city collecting revenue so I think must just
like many other families need to evaluate their own budgets and be committed to strategically planning how
to address this this is sort of you know a a sort of warning light
of of of our office and just making that suggestion that for those that do budget
and authorize that budget that this just needs to be looked at and planned on
moving forward what I'll add to that quickly is that
you'll often hear conversations about how people are penalized for living in the city because they have to pay the city wage tax right but our real estate
tax tends to end up end up being lower than the outer BBS but you're not seeing that real estate tax on your weekly
paycheck right so with the common level ratio down to where it is it's not actually surprising to me that these are
converging our real estate tax and our earned income tax revenue um the amazing thing is that the city is growing little
by little i think there was an article that came out today that we're up about 3,000 folks which is wonderful to hear
but we need housing for them right um Pittsburgh remains one of the top 20 most competitive renters markets in the
country there are don't I know it there are consistently you know pieces coming
out about how much uh rent has increased for folks um I believe the average
number of applicants on a rental property in Pittsburgh is eight right now if I'm remembering from the last time that was studied uh which is a lot
i mean we're not a big city right and so some of this is also addressing housing availability in creative ways if we do
have more renters we are going to see less in real estate tax directly right but that can ultimately turn up in great
ways for our earned income tax for other areas of city growth um so while it's something that I certainly am interested
in keeping an eye on and I think our office is interested in keeping an eye on it doesn't necessarily mean that there are negative consequences it just
means that it's something that we have to track and make sure that as real estate income goes down and earned income goes up we're not losing folks in
the process to unaffordable housing prices yeah uh yeah and you know it it
again there's a there's a housing angle on in every conversation that we have here at this table and and in every
policy um you know and by by and large Pittsburgh is still a very affordable
city you know compared to our national competitors the again the the concern is
that it it is you know there's a difference between speed and uh you know speed and
acceleration and we are accelerating quickly into being an unaffordable city
um because of our our housing market the way that it is uh you know again I think this is something that I I see as just
Pittsburgh is changing and um but I am you know going to continue keeping an
eye on on that i guess with I I want to make sure that
I'm understanding the purpose of the act correctly and and make sure that my
uh explanation of of what we're doing here is is correct and so my the way that I see the acter is it's it's not
showing if you are in good financial shape as much as it's showing this is what your bank account says right now it
doesn't you know I you can look at my bank account and say that I'm I'm doing okay but it doesn't it doesn't say you
know what my rent is or student loans there's very little in the act that's forwardlooking and it is a it's a like
retro it's a yearbook of where we finished the year before um the 2020 Q1
numbers are things that we did in the month between um in April um while we
were wrapping this up just to give policy makers a look onto where we were financially moving into 2025 um and
there are trends that you can look through out here i mean you can look up um demographic and economic statistics
you can look up city employment in the last 10 years so it does provide a bigger snapshot than just the last year
um and there are trends that you can of course derive from that when you see something growing year-over-year over 10
years like you know those are things that you should we should review and if there are conversations to be had but it
is a yearbook it is not a um five or 10 year projection so our goal in being
here for this and any other reporter audit that our office produces is to inform you um you know I I'm also like
just really proud of this report and the work that goes into it is just like unbelievable um so you know for our
staff too I think it's an opportunity to showcase you know the work we do day in and day out because you know often you
don't see the checks going out right you don't hear when the when when the bill is paid so I think it's an opportunity
and it also is an opportunity for a conversation right this is where we finished this is where we think we're
headed um and what what discussion do we have need to have around that great um
all right well that'll see if I have another round of questions here but I will uh pass it to to my colleague here
thank you um Councilman Wilson thank you Chair and thanks for coming
today and uh great to see all the all the faces at the table and I wanted to
uh get right to the point of what I was reading when I uh saw the saw the report
which was um do you feel
that our finances are prop are being properly managed in terms of the five-year plan
i think that if trends continue that this is not a sustainable path um and I
think that the the the conversations particularly around the expenditure side
of things um it's a shared responsibility our office doesn't budget but city council does as well as uh as
the administration so I think that that needs to be a more robust conversation
we are as Andrew has said a neutral party until we look at something afterwards we're you know my goal has
not been to tell you to spend money here or spend there and I am very conscious
of the intentional boundaries around these offices and these functions um but
I if these trends continue particularly given the macroeconomic factors at play
I do not believe that it is our finances are in a sustainable position but from
your end of the table how what changes will be made to the five-year plan to
reflect a like in the next year's budget to reflect a well first off maybe next year's budget but is it um appropriate
for council to ask uh the mayor since we're out of the window that we could open the operating budget is it um you
know is it ever the recommendation of the controllers's office that the mayor opens the operating budget and we make
adjustments now I mean how we're basically halfway through 2025 um I what
I would encourage and this is what I said at the table when I was here for our office's um budget hearing and I
don't know when that was after Thanksgiving um there are concerning factors that we have in terms of our
budgeted expenditures as a city um we've been very vocal about overtime spending
and making sure that we're budgeting appropriately for that um and from my
perspective you know I'm not going to I don't think it's appropriate for me to go line by line through expenditures um
but what I will tell you is that expenditures you know again on the macro level things are going to be more
expensive it appears that we are going to bring in less money than we had budgeted for on the revenue side so
those two factors alone you could conclude in any scenario that it isn't sustainable for the next you know if
this was a one-off and we expected things to rebound I might have a different opinion but the economic situation is is while fluid appears to
be like it's headed in the wrong direction um as it relates to you know the US economy and given those trends it
makes me concerned that's something I was interested in um you know in terms of recently in the
past couple weeks especially thinking more deeply about the concerns uh
especially this year and also the five-year plan i mean we're not budgeting we saw this council saw this
um you know appropriately for overtime and especially now since you know the
storm happened which no one could control but that will definitely increase the amount of overtime so it seems like a good um if we want to be
good financially we would um make that request to the administration to open the budget so we can readjust things so
that we wouldn't have to um take away services in the future
so the one thing I would say about the storm is the thing that's important to budget for is things that you can't
predict or control right so and that's true for anything um I mean we're
killing the planet we are going to see more significant and severe weather events happen like that was a once in
a-lifetime storm in 1925 but it's 2025 and that could happen in in six weeks i
mean I you know when you look at all these ancillary issues weather you know just
it's you have to budget for a worst case scenario not this is what we hope we
where we land um particularly with matters like that let me refocus the question what threshold would you what recommendation
i understand that there's limited amount of you know using that word recommendation what threshold would you
um use as a guiding post for how much um let's just say overtime overtime pay
increases in a quarter where we would you know where it would be a almost we
were being uh negligent on the council side if we didn't make a request to the
administration to open the budget so we can readjust uh spending what I would say from the
perspective of last fall because I think that just mechanically I can speak better about the year is if you're going
if there's going to be a reduction in budgeted hours for overtime for example what operational changes were made to
avoid those overtime costs um and again I have no idea what information was
provided to to you all but very little okay very little the the the answer that I was um given was that they would have
to look into it more at the administration so my understanding is that uh they actually are not in control
of what's happening um and they have to go and ask departments as to why those
would be increases and so I'm really concerned about the leadership of how
overtime is happening i feel like it should start at the top especially whenever alarms are raised on on your
side of the table and it seems pretty negligent uh for council to move
continue to move forward especially if we see in the in the second half of of the year that spending is continuing to
increase uh in terms of overtime and that doesn't even get to what we're talking about in the five-year plan so I
think what bothers me the most is that we're not being honest with the public about how the five-year plan totally
diminishes how we will actually provide services to this to the residents of Pittsburgh when we talk about our most
vulnerable residents I mean in the five let's let's look at them in the five-year plan you know what's there for
small businesses at the URA what's there for uh spending on paving what's there
for spending in general i'm seeing multiple accounts zeroed out in the 5-year plan and it seems like not only
we did a poor job of asking questions that would literally get uh to the bottom um of how they would manage the
situation when we passed the budget but I'm now seeing uh that um you know there
are multiple uh failures in leadership uh not specifically even finances but in
broad broad um broad strokes in terms of how we will actually create revenue and
have a conversation about council how we create revenue venue and one way I would think we would create revenue is to get
more tax dollars through real estate and not uh go to go to city planning and
completely uh halt development um because there's you know all developers
are concerned about inclusionary zoning with no real um incentive to build so
right now we're in a so let's just let's just paint this picture right now we're in a state where we literally halt the
development because they don't know whether or not they're going to have to do 10% they don't know um if there will
be you know a specialized lurer for them in terms of at the school district or the county because we can only control
we could do here at the city so now we're not going to get that revenue that we would I mean this is all planning
like building takes you know two years to you know even build some of this stuff um that's new tax revenue and I
fail to see how um you know we're going to we're going to we're going to get anywhere uh in
terms of increasing that revenue if we continually go on the path of not consulting council on uh best strategies
to grow the city and you know I'm just making a blanket statement saying that
uh feels like gross mismanagement of city practices I'm sorry common practices that that happen between the
administration and the council and I feel like uh the ball's being dropped uh
on both sides um but you know from my angle it looks
like we can definitely have uh better leadership in terms of from the administration to tell us uh what the
realities are of how they're administering government i recently had a conversation with someone who said "Well don't you vote on the budget?"
Yeah but you know who we listen to when we vote on the budget is the administration you know who who can fire
the grass cutters when they don't go out the administration you know who can um
actively uh control overtime the administration so you know we believe
how they would handle it and you know we're sitting here i don't have anything in my inbox after a leadership meeting
we're sitting here uh two weeks after that topic was brought up by how the
overtime pay is so um you know uh so
much has increased i don't have any answers i don't know does anyone here
have any answers i can give it over to any council person right now if they have any
answers the administration can come up here and tell us what's going on i
welcome that yeah
thank you Councilman uh Jake Paul director Office of Management Budget and Deputy Mayor um could you is could you
restate the question you'd look you're looking for me to answer our uh finance
chair wrote a letter to the administration asking them asking uh yeah yourself uh about you know what the
concerns and I won't you know speak to every line of the letter because but the spirit of the letter was hey what's
going on sure I'm not sure if I can if I'm if I'm paraphrasing too much to just let me know uh because I'm not the one
that wrote the letter but I'm in full support of finding answers of how overtime um is getting so out of control
right especially in a time whenever for just like the controller mentioned like we have to account for major storms that
we can't that we can't predict um storms that you know obviously that's you know
storm like that hasn't happened but there's multiple things that haven't happened I mean uh you know every every
year every two years every 3 years it doesn't always have to be wind and and and and you know sideways rain and all
everything that you know came together that night whenever all the trees came down uh and so in that leadership
meeting um you know it was brought up and I haven't received any real answer
as to Yeah you know I saw a lot of I heard a lot of speculation but I think the public should know how the
administration is going to uh address council so we can make informed decisions i mean the ball was in your
court to open the budget it's past that time where we can make any changes to the budget so our time is over we listen
to you at the other side of the table in the fall so just trying to understand how we're going to continue to go on
this path sure so so as we uh indicated at that time um we are preparing a
response to the both the concerns raised by the controllers's office and the and
council uh finance chair regarding overtime in conjunction with the first
quarter report which is um we we believe to be the appropriate time to provide
commentary on things that happened during the first quarter when uh all of
the analysis of spending revenue revenues and spending for the quarter is complete so so all that we asked at that
time was that we be able to complete the work on the first quarterly report in order to provide those answers because
there are insights to be discovered in the process of completing that report that help answer some of those questions
uh that report I believe is due tomorrow uh and is in the process of being
finalized right now so happy to um address what we've discovered in the
course of that analysis that is in part incorporated in that report and in part can be addressed as a result of that
report happening and also just note that I believe strongly in the practice instituted in code of producing those
quarterly reports for exactly this reason that it it is um a mechanism by which we share with council and the
public the status of um revenues and expenditures over the
course of the year but it we need the full accounting to be closed for the first quarter in order to produce the
report do you feel that it's um acceptable that you don't have an
immediate understanding as to why there is such a disparity in terms of
projected in the first quarter versus what was spent no because in order to un spending
patterns are not consistent over the course of the year so looking at the
first quarter alone and in particular looking at at the time this issue was raised not even a fully completed
accounting of the first quarter does not on its own answer those questions
without further analysis um you know the as as the controller mentioned right the
the reason that the annual comprehensive financial report looks at the year in
its entirety is that looking at the full year h you know accounts for those
variations month over month or quarter over quarter so what I can tell you about the first quarter of
2025 as relates to overtime in public safety um what we saw
what we um alluded to in our initial conversation about this but took further
research to dig into more fully is that um first of all in the Bureau of
Emergency Medical Services an extensive portion of the year's annual training
which is conducted on overtime pay occurred in the first quarter so we we
that lines up with the first quarter overtime in EMS being higher in the
first quarter than over the course of the entire year and so that accounts for a portion of the increase in overtime
we've seen what was the you said you're commenting on EMS i'm starting I'm starting with EMS yes why let's narrow
down that one so EMS conducted some extensive trainings for EMS personnel
particularly those who participate in the dive team in the first quarter those
trainings happen on overtime but they don't happen every quarter they don't even happen every year so so yes we we
saw increased overtime spending in EMS in the first quarter we also saw just
EMS how much did we go over on EMS in the first quarter 66% 66% Okay so give
me a Is there a million dollar number $100,000 number
um I can look that up right now and see if I can find it on my phone so do you believe that diving school was the
reason why uh we're 66% over the budget not on its own there was more
information that I was preparing to provide that's where I'm totally Yeah just not really understanding
what are you talking about so again we we budget for the amount of overtime we expect in the over the course of an
entire year and that includes both SK you know anticipated and
unanticipated overtime do you have any other information on that i've heard the diving training was a portion of it
another portion of it one of the reasons which we did um discuss at length during
the budget hearings last year in testimony when asked on multiple occasions about projected lower spending
on overtime um in still with EMS again we can address other cost centers was
that the transition in the new um contract with the paramedics union to
allowing for combo units um would reduce the number of mandated callbacks for
paramedics do you think I want to just pause here for a second uh controller do
you think that we should like council should um try to have an understanding of what quarterly we're going over
because as money gets tighter we just listen to a whole year in terms of
what's being spent so whenever there's a report that comes out and says we're 60 66% over on EMS and we have um you know
it's I understand you're saying it's I mean although I I'm going to take it at face value say
you have to look into it you know you're sitting here at the table we're having a real discussion about what you know currently so you have to look into more
than just what you know them going to diving school but I'm just I'm taking on face value there's there's somewhat more
to it but should we have uh better um uh
accountability on the council side to understand how much we expect to go over each quarter i'm just like trying to
understand how we can do the best thing we can on our side so I would argue that
that overage with EMS is not only accountable in um diving and training i
mean we we were at $2.3 million the full at the end of Q1 the
total budget for overtime in EMS was $3.5 million so my question would be what operational changes have been done
to modify spending and overtime yes there are always ancillary incidents or
events but it from my perspective you know and again we are not a budgeting entity but it does appear that this is a
concerning trend yeah just that you're you know the numbers are alarming i'm trying to understand how this based on the information that we're given with
the report like how do we make decisions in terms of this is why I would like to finish answering the question the other
I think more significant change that happened in the course of the first quarter is that we put the transition to
allow for combo units between a paramedic and an EMT into effect in
March so that was bargained into the contract but it took some administrative time for that to take effect we
estimated in our proposed budget last year or in the budget proposal that we put before council last year and
articulated at this table that we believed that transition to combo units would dramatically reduce overtime in
EMS that change was implemented during the first quarter so at the beginning of
the first quarter we were not seeing the impact of that transformation we are
seeing it now in the numbers moving forward after that change and the reason for that briefly is because we can send
an ambulance out without not necessarily having two paramedics but having one paramedic and one EMT and we have a lot
more EMTs we no longer have to call back a paramedic in order to um make sure
that that ambulance goes out now again the full extent to which that will account for a reduction in overtime is
not something I can today tell you will will be the the full effect over the
course of the entire year and these are um figures that we do continuously monitor there also is quarterly
accountability for these questions in the form of the quarterly reports
so the the reason that we um stated at the time that this question was raised
that we would be able to speak to it when we produce the quarterly report is
precisely that that is the mechanism that we have and the reason that the quarterly report is issued 45 days after
the end of the quarter is that there is a standardized system of conducting this analysis in that window of time yeah cor
you're saying that that's our communication i appreciate you know that
you're just literally saying what's in the you know in the code of what has to happen but my question pertains more of
just like um that is alarming 66% and I would like it not to be that
way so we have a better understanding i just would hope in the next uh budget round that we're talking about
more specifics in terms of quarters because money's getting tight and I know this I want to make sure that I'm within
what this uh hearing is about and I know it's about the controls report just trying to have a better understanding of
uh I know I'm there and down a one I brought um you know director up here but
you know getting back to you know that report I
mean the only the only question that I have um for you because I I want to get
back to the the report um you know we I see it as like we
should reopen the budget So we can fix this do you see that we should do you
feel that we should reopen the budget to make any changes not at this time based on the current
information year to date as well as what we have seen so far in the second
quarter that's not yet um you know audited because those months aren't closed for example and just to to use an
example that responds to something that was addressed earlier um you know we have seen significant increases in
payments for local service tax and payroll prep that in
2024 came in in the first quarter those payments were h happened to be received in the second quarter this year so while
I do agree with the controller that looking at the first quarter numbers you would see a significant drop in those
revenue sources and you will also see that in the first quarter report because the first quarter report stops at the
end of March um we now know that it was a timing of payments issue there's a
significant degree to which the timing of payments is affecting that quarter overquarter figure um but that the gap
is not as large as it would appear looking only at the first quarter so on that basis
our assessment is that the um on the both revenue and expenditure side we are
still very much within the tolerance of the approved 2025 budget and that any
changes that need not changes any um adjustments that need to be made to remain within budget can be accomplished
through the normal course of administration of spending so no I would
not recommend that at this time so I have a I might have some more
questions but I want other to speak because I know I've been speaking for a while uh do you think council should
have more control to open the budget um than they do i I can't remember where that law where that law exists maybe
it's in the charter how of how you know we can only vote on open the budget
after a certain amount of time uh after we passed it but you know if there is a report I mean is there any like should
we propose to the public that council should you know have the ability to you
know reopen the budget um you know after you know uh the first quarter or like
should we extend that amount of time i'm not saying that I'm in the right but council should at least have the ability to take action uh you know together if
we feel that way and right now we don't have the ability to do that we I don't know that it's appropriate
for our office might for me to comment on that um but what I would say is I think that these conversations are quite
helpful and informative and I think that the budgeting process particularly as it relates to expenditures should be more
robust and engaging i mean there I know that fire overtime is exceptionally high there was no fire here budget hearing um
so I think that those are opportunities to have conversations and to really get into the meat of things and like really
analyze figures and um and I think that you know both sides of the um well three
people participate in um revenue projections but the two that do um expenditures i I do think that there
needs to be I would recommend um that there needs to be more
conversation and a a more robust analysis on the trajectory of where
expenditures are headed and I think particularly given the cost increases of even just raw goods let alone inflation
and and our need to employ people um and pay them a living wage i think that when
you look at you know construction projects they're going to go up by probably 25% over the course of the next
18 months so um I think that those conversations would be very informative
in in terms of making sure that um we're as a city budgeting appropriately yeah I
definitely I definitely agree i mean we're going Cali rec center there was a community meeting the community not everyone but some people were asking um
you know could we build more and the project manager on the city side said project costs are you know really high
there's I don't see how we could do something that's bigger so yeah definitely more challenges ahead and I'll you know give it up to the chair um
so we can continue on i may have you know maybe a couple more questions but thanks thank you Madam Chair may I
briefly address that point i just want to I just want to agree uh with the controllers's point um the increase in
cost of building materials and building costs as a result of at this point even just the threat or or belief um that
that tariffs are impending um is a very real thing and and we we wholly share that concern
um in the United States building materials are um overwhelm I'm sorry in
Pennsylvania in particular overwhelmingly sourced from Canada and the potential for for tariffs on Canada is having a big impact in those markets
um you know those costs would relate almost exclusively to the capital budget
so it is something that we're monitoring as we look at cost increases or overruns in capital and that is you know unlike
the operating budget open to amendment at any time and and we we may very well
um over the course of the next few months see more proposed budget amend capital budget amendments to account for
that as we're getting bids back on projects but I just wanted to agree with that point and and clarify that we we do
foresee budget adjustments in capital for things like that i mentioned capital
project in Cali because it's just evident that there is an issue with
costs and that is how we I'm mentioning capital projects so that we understand
that getting development going and having real estate tax obtaining real estate tax is that that's how we get
that tax and so that's I was painting in the picture of why um like even from the
city side we're going to the public and saying we can't build more so That's just the point I was trying to
make how it relates to the actual operating costs thank you Council Member
Warwick round two did you have additional questions oh you didn't want to go i'll I'll just I'll wait till the
end yeah okay um yeah just so I guess I what we sort of shifted to the overtime
thing so just to because I you know I when when that report came I had some questions too so just to kind of and I
appreciate the the responses Nita from you so
um just so I'm so so the
um so the totals just with regard to the to the overtime it
was that we have spent 39% or this was like in March right in Q1 right so we'd
spent 39% of what was budgeted to total like
across all departments for premium pay for premium pay right for right like all all forms of overtime okay so so 39% in
the first quarter um and then I I had I had been curious about what
um what it looked like in past years at the same time right so
in and and and Namita you wrote that that this actually has been an ongoing
problem going back to 2019 right so in 2019 at around that same time it was 39%
in 2020 it was 31% um in 2021 it was down to 27% in 2022 31 33% 2023 31% 2024
37% so this is kind of something that has been a and I and I don't know if it's a an
issue to solve like in a in a larger in the larger scheme of things but it seems
like this is not a new problem yeah um it there again it gets to the seasonal
variation question another reason why the first quarter is often so there's a
reason that the first quarter is often high is that the first quarter includes the St patrick's Day parade which is one
of two events per year where there is a significant utilization of city public safety personnel where we are not
reimbursed so the marathon um officers paramedics firefighters are
working on overtime but P3R is invoiced and pays for those costs so we don't we don't actually see those costs the two
events where that is not the case are the St patrick's Day parade and the
Fourth of July celebration so we see spikes in overtime in the quarters that include those two events because they
are non-reimbured significant users of overtime that's another example of um a
seasonal variation that our analysis since the report was released indicated to us is a mitigating factor again I'm
not suggesting that um there are not other challenges that the uh you know
the flag on this issue um doesn't uncover that are appropriate but uh
there are there are numerous factors that we also see as explanations of the
use of overtime in the first quarter that um are not causes for concern but are rather results of seasonal variation
in when events or training occur um or are factors that we accounted for in the
proposed overtime numbers as a result of operational changes but that weren't fully uh hitting the books if you will
during the first quarter i will add though we've EMS finished 2024 with
overtime their overtime budget was basically double where it had been um and we also cut the budgeted amount like
the raw amount of money we had allocated for premium pay for both fire and police
so the percentage like year-over-year but we have less money in that pot in
2025 than we had in 2024 by at least $10 million so that percentage is fair but at the
same time we're working with $10 million less so we have budgeted less so you
would expect that that would track if those cost containment measures had been fully implemented but we have not seen
evidence that that is and that's our concern we have less money to work with okay okay yeah and we would agree that
for a variety of reasons we haven't seen those cost containment measures they're not borne out in the first quarter
numbers and um for for reasons I've addressed but but we do expect that um
overtime spending over the balance of the year will not reflect um those same
factors in its entirety okay and and then I don't know if you said here but I
or was that for DPW specifically is snow
because there was like so much snow is that again just it's something I heard it's another source of of seasonal
variation that happens every year right or or more to the point it is different
every year depending on how serious the winter is and we we do definitely see
the most DPW overtime spending in the fourth quarter in the first quarter the seasons when it
snows and more in the first quarter than in the fourth because there's more more
winter storms in January February and into March than there are typically in November and December so we don't expect
25% of overtime spending to consistently hit in every quarter of the year particularly in DPW um and I think that
yes a snowy winter with s with with uh more snows storms than the previous year
accounts for a significant portion of the overtime we saw in DPW this year
that's the most we can say with the data we have right now it's not it doesn't account for it 100% again I'm not
attempting to to say that it accounts for 100% and in the DPW spending there was also overtime utilization not in
street operations that was also elevated and that we're examining um but that is a factor that was at play well oh and
the the and this is the reason I've we've uh raised the flag that we have or
concerning um words that we've used like the storm that that's what I was going
to ask that is in this pay the paid to is it Thursday so the pay tomorrow sorry
it's been a long week um so it's in the pay tomorrow so the from my perspective
um you know the reason overtime exists is for events that you can't plan for
but events that you can't plan for are increasing in not decreasing right so
you have storm variability and you know we've talked about the other ancillary economic impacts that are going to you
know cause to increase and from my perspective that's what we need to
account for not like there's one snowstorm but the fact that these storms are going to become more common and more
frequent right yeah that's what I was going to ask was with this recent storm like if
that you know I assume we had lots of unexpected overtime yes and but but to
the controller's point right that that that pay is tomorrow the um so we're
still getting the full picture of of overall utilization that that data now
exists because it's been filed but we haven't had a chance to examine it yet
um so then going well just so this is just so
so let's say for example with the storm right so an unexpected event and we're paying for you know not just but you
know lots of things around the storm so would is that where this rainy day fund comes into play is that like
mechanically yeah I mean yes so the it the rainy day fund the fund balance
gives us budget flexibility ility year-over-year the problem is when you get down to that 10% or when it's at the
70 million mark which is what the budget anticipates the five-year um budget projection at the end of 2029 you
basically have no flexibility because it's at the 10% of expenditures which is required for the home or per city code
um and that was a leftover policy from act 47 that council and I actually don't even know who adopted it but
um Huh c okay but we maintained and I again think that's best practices but
there's there are also no teeth on that legislation there's no mandatory um cost containment that happens when
you when the fund balance gets to 10% of expenditures so um that's again you know
my big concern is making sure that we have the budget flexibility because when you look at what happened in 2020 which
again going back to this theme of these events are going to continue to happen with greater frequency we had
a like unbelievable and rapid decre decline in in month-over-month revenue
for the city for six months and things sort of stabilized at the end of 2020
but we had six months where we I mean that's why we have these bond payments that are 25 and 26 now because we punted
them and that was the smart thing to do but that's why we're spending $50 million more in debt service over this
two-year period because we had to delay that payment so from my perspective I think the thing that we need to do as a
city is make ourselves as nimble as possible to respond to emergencies and
emergencies can look different i mean they can look like economic emergencies where you know everything costs more
they can look like a global pandemic and they can look like a storm that lasts for an hour and a half and has half the
city without power for a week um so from my perspective that's why that fund
balance is so valuable and you do use it in you know in years when the economy
contracts um and we but last year the economy was growing and we only added a
million dollars to that account so that is concerning for me moving forward that you know we we weren't saving in 24 um
because that would have been a year that we would have been able to do that but the purpose of the fund balance is
to use it on down years um but when you create an situation where you're overly reliant on it you hit a cliff
yeah as as a matter of the overall analysis I I completely agree um I think
that um our perspective is that un I I
would say that you use the fund balance to um be there to rely upon in
situations unexpected situations and emergency situations like the controller described and or in cases of economic or
financial volatility to smooth the curve right so that if so that we're not
dramatically increasing or decreasing city services um for what are
timedefined challenges right and I think there are two um uh challenges we have
right now that are um impacting the current projections and the current um
conditions so one is as the controller just mentioned the um increased debt
service payments that we face this year and next year as a result of refinancing debt during COVID we've known about
those obviously since we made since we programmed in the refinancing and they've been reflected and addressed in
the um speaking only for the budgets that I've worked on going all the way back to 2022's the 2023 budget as
proposed in 2022 we saw that coming we in we worked to ensure that um the
spending plans we produced accounted for those shifts um you know but part of
that is you know because we have this increased bond payment that we know will be paid off in
2026 right that then smoothing that curve of services understanding that there is a finite endpoint to that um
you know it is it was in our estimation when proposing the budget that um draws on the reserve fund um in 25 and 26 to
get to the other side of that knowing that there's a significant change starting in 27 was appropriate it um the
other point I'll make is that the the current 5-year plan shows declining real
estate taxes every year and that is part of the forecast to to to underscore and
agree with a point that the controller and Namita made that is because of the common level ratio decision which is
putting downward pressure every year on what we can collect in real estate taxes uh and this also connects to Councilman
Charlotte's point um were were it not for the common level ratio we we would not be seeing the earned income tax
eclipsing real estate taxes we we we we have seen real estate tax revenue go down as values have gone down downtown
um but we we would not be projecting real estate taxes going down every year
for the full 5-year plan were it not for the common level ratio decision and frankly we don't
anticipate that to actually be the case by the end of the five-year plan because we anticipate a resolution
um due to ongoing litigation around reassessment right but we can't forecast
for a reassessment that hasn't been called for sorry that has it has been
called for in litigation but hasn't been scheduled right because we wouldn't want to for example put it into the forecast
that it will happen next year and then it turns out it doesn't happen until 2027 and then our forecast is wildly off
right better to show a very conservative forecast that assumes it will never
happen and then be pleasantly surprised when when that adjustment can be made to the to the positive so um if that
reassessment occurs within the confines of the current 5-year plan then the later years of the uh forecast will look
much more favorable at that point if it doesn't we have a five-year plan that
maintains our adherence to the requirements of the code which was our
effort in putting together the 2025 budget was to show that we could withstand that entire period and we
remain within those parameters knowing it's unlikely to last that long because we're not the only municipality or local
government agency in Alageney County that faces difficult challenges as a
result of the common level ratio case i think we're in much better position than most because we do a 5-year plan i think
there are a lot of municipalities that can't go another year um you know like they we'll see in
their 2026 budget discussions this fall them really running into significant
challenges as a result of this but because they only budget a year at a time they haven't futurecasted that
condition yet got it so so what you're saying is just
to kind of for the public right we we do a budget in a given year but we have a
fiveyear we actually budget for five years and that budget is
um do certified by the controller is that what it is we certify revenue
projections we are not a budgeting um branch of city government so we have opined in a what I would say a limited
way um on expenditures and expenditure projections but we certify revenue for
five years okay so you're familiar then with this revenue projections that are
taking into account less I mean you know assuming based on things
that we know that real estate tax will that that revenue will go down yeah and
that is that was part of the fiveyear plan yeah okay
um Okay um and then I do just just quickly
because I mean this this this was um a professor at Pitt who
released some census uh building permit survey that showed that actually build building permits in in in Pittsburgh
have gone up significantly in the past couple of years i don't know if that's something
that you're familiar with i'm just wondering if that you know like this major skyrocketing of building permits
could potentially mean even if it's not part of the five-year projection could
maybe be a positive in that those could be so that graph taxes coming online i
don't know i'm not I mean it's again it's you know like the I want I want to I want to I want to both um address why
I think that those those trends are positive but also a few caveats right so
so um the graph you're referring to includes basically the entire 21st
centur it goes all the way back to about the year 2000 right it correctly shows years in which and and and it's not just
building per it's not all building permits it's housing starts new housing construction it correctly shows that
there were years in the 2000s when new housing unit construction in Pittsburgh
was in the dozens right or even the you know less than 50 right so the the graph
shows an extraordinarily steep increase because we were building almost zero housing in the first decade of this
century and even into the second one and that has a lot to do with the difficult situation we're in right now with
housing supply and housing affordability is that we were not building any and then we moved very quickly into building
a lot that was very expensive right got it um so there are a number of things
you can infer from that um however I will say that yes the continued year-over-year increase in permitting is
a good sign for real estate revenue fee and permit revenue um when we're talking
about housing income you know that we were very glad to see as it was addressed here today a second year of
modest but but ongoing population growth um right which which signals um you know
that the kind of demographic transition from declining population to stable population now to two years of growth it
suggests that you know we're we're headed in the right direction it's far too soon to say but it it's a good
indication um you building in 2024 compared to 2023 so again not
looking at 25 years where when it was so low at the beginning the graph looks different comparing 23 to 24 we issued
about the same number of building permits but the total dollar value of um
construction activity because you you declare on the permit not just what you're building but also how much it
costs went up dramatically um and we had a high the highest it was the highest
value of construction ever um in 2023 one about $1.4 billion dollars of
declared value in construction um you know which again is a a strong economic
indicator like the job um the uh wage growth is you know it's it is in and of
itself doesn't tell a whole story because the uh economic inequality is a big factor that we have to account for
as well when we see those things happening but um I think it does have the potential to
have a positive revenue effect on real estate over time only
um if we're able to fix the calculation of the real estate tax and that points back to the common level ratio
um also just with regard to income like the the the income revenues on income
tax wage wage tax revenues do we and maybe this is
Is there any indication that I mean it's something I would guess is true but I
don't know is that folks are moving into Pittsburgh who make more money is that
could that be part of that increase yes i mean I think the wage EIT wage
growth does mean that wages are up um payroll prep which is the tax that the employers pay is stagnant which to me is
concerning for growth um so I mean on the whole the wage tax yes I mean that
is what it means right if if payroll prep is stable or even declining um but
people are making more money so yeah I mean I'm wondering too just generally wages going up but also just higher
earner like higher income folks coming into the city i think yeah the thing I would jobs and things like that that pay
more maybe than and again this is more of a macroeconomic trend but when you
look at the sectors that are being most significantly impacted by the this presidential administration
um you know our largest employers are the ones that are going to be impacted
so I I am very very worried about um
like even a hiring freeze with even one of our our large nonprofit uh partners
in the city would be very detrimental to wage taxes and the overall growth in the
city um you know I think what we're seeing with the deed transfer tax is actually like a early indicator of that
because people aren't you know moving from a a three-bedroom three-bedroom
house in Greenfield to a four or five bedroom house in Greenfield if their family grows and instead are staying where they are um so that those
macroeconomic trends are very very concerning um and then when you look at
potential cuts to federal reimbursement programs that pay for you know whether it's Medicare or Medicaid um our
hospital systems rely on those payments to to you know balance their budgets i mean they serve people who are using
those pro insurance programs um and if those are curtailed in any way um particularly in the cruel way that is
being proposed I'm very very worried about like the economic conditions that'll exist in in Pittsburgh
agree that we we suspect that the um increase that that as the controller
said the the fact that the um wage tax is increasing while the payroll prep tax
is stable is attributable to a combination of um uh people making
people making more money at the jobs they already have higher earners moving
in and replacing people who are say retiring right and so so same number of jobs but higher incomes um and um
also um we that those two factors can can
account for the increases there as relates to um the deed transfer tax i
mean I I I think that yes broader economic uncertainty
um plays yeah plays a role high interest rates play a role the ongoing trend of
um renters representing a larger share of the city population will also play a
role right um not that long ago Pittsburgh was a majority homeowner city
we're now about 60 roughly 60% renter city so it was more and more people are renting that means there are more fewer
and fewer people purchasing homes we know that to be true just as a matter as a data point
um a lot of reasons there could be a lot of reasons for that both on the buyer side and on the supply side but as that
happens we would expect fewer transactions right so I think I don't disagree with anything control said just
adding a few more thoughts to that and the other thing I would just flag for the purpose of this conversation and it
requires its own post agenda but uh school enrollment in Pittsburgh public schools is down which is a very
concerning factor for for you know someone who's worried about the financial future Um because if families
are sending kids to pro parochial schools or private schools it's effectively an additional tax um and we
need to do everything we can to make Pittsburgh public schools a destination school district um we lost a ton of
families during the pandemic and we haven't fully rebuilt that trust and obviously that is a long larger larger
conversation um but I do think it is a significant factor in terms of where
people ultimately end up buying if they choose to buy um the work they're choosing to do etc
just for the deed transfer this is a but um because this is something we talked about at one point at the table is that
there and and correct me if I have this wrong but is there like a loophole with these LLC's
that like buy a house and it's the LLC and then they sell the LLC to someone as
opposed to selling the property i don't know that real estate has tracked how often an LLC is bought or sold or if
they would even have that information but that is a loophole most deed
transfer comes from resident like I'm selling my house to you or your whatever
which is just it's a lot of paperwork for a single family home you know it's something to be aware of um particularly
I mean there are a lot of issues that are associated with LLC's buying a large number of residential properties but um
from my perspective it it's like right now it it's not that is
not the reason that this number is dropping got it got it i just was wondering maybe for but it is an issue and I I mean there are again a ton of
issues that come along with LLC's owning residential property um that is one of
them in the city yeah I just was wondering because I had been thinking about that if there was a way to kind of
close that like have the deed transfer go with the enemy whatever that's a different That's a It's a matter of
state that's a matter of state oh that's a state okay okay um Okay i don't think
Well yeah I do well so again back to this rainy day fund so it's healthy now uh about 200
million right and you said but you're concerned because we only put an extra million so yeah so I mean
and when that is growing it means you're saving money year-over-year right um and
when you go from a $23 million increase to a $1 million increase it means you're
saving less got it and when you look at the the revenue and expenditure trajectory over the five-year plan um
again we're expected to get to the bare minimum with expenditures and money out
right we'll have that 10% at the end of 2029 so is the current budget so just so
I kind of try you know because I this is not my strong suit right so I try and kind of understand things like in terms
of my own so so like I put money in my 401k every year
right i put money every year in my 401k um but some
years I put less for whatever reason right but I still have like that savings
there and I I don't want to dip into it too much right you want it to be healthy
right but it's there just in case so that's I don't know if that's a good
analogy no I I would say the reserve balance is more of like a savings
cushion that you would have right for that rainy
day expense of something but strategically you can't without any plan
and you're always relying on that without continually saving if you're
taking things out oh I it's going to go out to So just so I'm so so so but but
we we knew coming in and again like so it I mean because I remember us talking
about this for the last two budget cycles like we knew coming in that 25 26
was going to be tight right so I mean would
it again I'm just curious like and so so if if if we're if we're not putting as much in this in the savings account for
25 26 because we know it's going to be tight but that's with the understanding
that coming out of 20 than 27 28 we're going to kind of be in a better place because right no like so the trend
continues so the trend to draw from the fund balance continues after that's the
issue if it were rebounding and stabilizing at you know $120 million
year-over-year I would be less alarmed but to me the big concern is that that's
uh expenditures outpacing revenue is going to continue for the entire duration of the
five-year plan we don't budget for 10 years like the federal government so I can't comment on what 2030 and 2031 are
going to look like but looking at the three years after these two pay big payments it it doesn't
rebound um but I think we like have like a de there's some it doesn't it doesn't
rebound because at the same time we are forecasting real estate taxes to
continue to go down as well because of the common level ratio so this is where the two two observations I think we're
making here um uh like uh run into one another right
um in but we were a few years ago I can't remember if it was in for the 2024
budget but I know for the 2023 budget um you know we were not forecasting declining real estate revenues because
we had not yet seen we were forecasting about flat real estate revenues because we had not yet seen evidence of the
impact of the common level ratio case that would let us give us a sense as to what the annual impact would be and at
that time we did um more or less show the type of rebound I'm generalizing but
that the controller is talking about right we we putting less into the reserve fund in 23 and 24 and then it
would it would rebound um what has changed in subsequent years is we have taken that conservative position in
budgeting for declining real estate taxes yes we do see the trend continue
to us that is evidence further evidence of the urgent need to resolve the
question of real estate taxes in Alageney County and the common level ratio case if we were not having to
forecast declining real estate taxes over those out years I think we would
have a very different picture as it relates to the reserve balance in those later years of the projection
okay um Okay well this has all been in I mean it's a
lot it's a lot of information and I you know I I should know more about it than
I do so I appreciate you all i'm thrilled to be here anytime you want to talk about it um uh so I do want to just
one thing is because there's so so this is just and I you know because of the the season that we're in and and
um you know I've heard the term act 47 thrown around a lot right just various
folks I've heard it on the radio and this kind you know so
um just so so it's clear so the criteria for like the the you know going into act
47 this like financial distress program include expenditures exceeding revenues
for three years not making payroll for 30 days
failing to remit employee tax withholdings things defaulting on debt payments or
failing to make uh pension payments have any of these things
happened well expenditures are expected to outpace revenue for the next five years so I mean that is true i'm not
saying I and I have reiterated that I do not believe we're on the brink of act 47 like okay but but that first factor is
going to happen for the next five years which is why I again my perspective has been the entire time that we need to
have an honest conversation with city residents and let them know where things are headed and that you know if you're out and someone's complaining that their
alley hasn't gotten paved it's probably not going to get paved next year like it just isn't I mean the cost of petroleum
is going to continue to increase right asshole's going to be more expensive because of it so from my perspective I
think the most important time to have that conversation with people is before you hit that point so but we
expenditures are outpacing revenue and they are going to for the next for the budget that you all voted on says that
fiveyear plan okay you want to respond i think your question was have any of
those things happened the answer is no um are they are they are any of them
expected to happen this year i would say the answer is also no
um the uh whether they happen whether we expenses
exceed revenues um in future years will
depend on a number of variables right the the forecast and the five-year plan are
projections not actual appropriated spending right and nor are they year-end actual results right um you know so um I
don't I don't believe that we are in a position that would make that condition
unavoidable right we're not we we can address with from where we sit today
there's no reason why that scenario has to come to pass within our existing
ability to manage for these variables and depending on some outside factors
right that we can't control and this thus can't put into the forecast i mean
I mean so okay so you so Councilman Wilson asked "Do you feel that there's anything we should do now?" So we're
about halfway through the year that we should do now again this year next year well I'm I'm
not comment I'm not prepared to say anything about next year yet right because we haven't proposed a budget for next year yet will certainly there there
are many things that by the time we propose a budget for 2026 will be very different than they were um you know in
the fall of 2024 when we proposed the current 5-year plan chief among them the
tariffs and the uh economic volatility that has followed the inauguration of
the Trump administration that we'll have to take into account i do not believe that there's anything warranting a
reopening of the 2025 budget to make adjustments at this time for reasons I already stated that the um we're we're
well within the kind of brackets of our ability to manage the um expenditure
issues that you know that we face right now and is there any type of I mean I
know you don't but you know I I don't know because I always say this right like we're council we look at
the budget and then it comes and we approve it but it's always like well what do you want to cut do you know what I mean like what what would have to go
and I I mean I just I just know over the past couple of years like there have
been a few things at least that off the top of my head like we have not introduced any new capital projects for
example right to try and just sort of not be adding new things and actually just you know finishing and doing the
things that we've already budgeted some for and getting those done is there anything else that you're looking
at for next year sort of with the same Yeah eye to
to to being frugal and and trying to conserve again I I the the the budget
process has a timeline is on the timeline that it's on for a reason right
it's it's still too early I think to give you a a clear uh articulate answer to that
question because there's still a lot we have to observe before making those um
recommendations and ultimately making that proposal but I do think that if the
cost of building materials continues to increase as it has been consistently
increasing the cost of construction has been consistently increasing since the pandemic first because of supply chain
disruptions then because of uh inflation and now because of inflation and tariffs
right so we will particularly in the capital budget um continue to face constraints and challenges and we do now
have projects that continue to be delayed because between when the their budgets are set and when bids are
received costs have gone up and we have to adjust right so that will continue to be a pain point and something that we
have to to address um in the coming years on the operating side of things I
I um you know we have every year identifi
you produced savings sometimes significant savings um in ma smart
management of our insurance costs uh our our um uh short-term disability costs
right to produce savings and we that we can continue to one that help us in the current year hit the mark and two that
over the long term we can factor into how we allocate or how we propose
funding but be able to offer a much clearer picture of this answer in
September when we produce the preliminary budget proposal okay all right yeah and I mean I guess just
generally I mean I know that this is something we're all aware of it's just you know what are the ways that we can
increase revenue without putting the squeeze on workingclass Pittsburgers you know what I mean folks who are
struggling just to you know buy groceries right um and I know that there
are then there's there are a number of things we aren't able to do which is very frustrating as a city right it
would be lovely if we could charge people who come into the city you know use the tunnel to come
into the city to go to work every day right i mean that just feels like something we should be able to do as a
city my understanding is that we're not allowed to do that from the I don't I'm not an expert in I
think it's state law and then PEDOT is the only entity that can toll an interstate right um I just wanted to
flag one thing i was I I had mentioned in an earlier point that the GFOA number for the fund balance is 10 the GFOA
number is 16.7 so we would hit that recommended threshold in 2028 not in 2029 um the
city code mandates 10% so when we're looking okay when you're looking at the fund
balance the current projections have us have us passing
um what the GFOA says is healthy in you know three
three and a half years when you say passing you mean going below yeah sorry excuse me dipping dipping below that
threshold the 16.7 threshold percent threshold in 2028 which is in three years got it but has us above or at what
is mandated man yeah there are no teeth in that yeah right so there are no teeth in it but the 10% is we'd hit at the end
of 2029 um but the 16.7% would happen at some point in 2028 got it
for further context on the fund balance in in 2020 before the before the city um
began spending out of it because of huge drop offs in revenue due to the pandemic
before that the fund balance was at $und00 million it's twice that today
right so once the um immediate impacts of uh
COVID on revenue were sort of rebounded from which in part ARPA played a large
role in we have consistently utilized that opportunity
to build up the fund balance for precisely these reasons right to to have
uh as much cushion as possible for for challenging times so before anybody knew
COVID was going to happen and that there would be either a drop in revenue or ARPA um the balance was $und00 million
and going up modestly every year but it was it was climbing but it was half of what it is today we've been able to I
see what dip into it rebound to where it was and then double it got it since 2020
okay so before COVID like our savings was you know like what what we had in the savings account generally every year
was around like a hundred million that's what it was at that point it was have been going up every year to that point
and what about before that do we know i mean the fund balance bottomed out in 2020 or 20 excuse me 2004 I think at
like $3 million okay it was and so like in like 2018 do we I mean if you don't
have it doesn't matter here i have it somewhere
it was at 133 million in 2019 um we spent about 50 of that in 2020 and then
continued to rebound after the pandemic okay so oh I see is this here's
is that is that gap unassigned
so okay so so so this oh I mean this seems like fairly sign so in 2019 we had
133 million in 2018 we had 114 this is in like in our savings account right we
had 114 million in 2017 Oh I'm going backwards apologies sorry 2020 we had 85
million that was COVID presumably where we had to That was like major rainy day like big time rainy day then 2021 we had
109 2022 up to 167 2023 up to 198 so we've been saving
money actually yes so we've been really putting money in the savings account
over the past few years oh I didn't even realize that and so then now in 2024
we're at 199 which is significantly [Music]
higher than we've ever been i mean of course things are more expensive and the dollar you know I mean I get that too
and in revenue we were um transferring from American Rescue
Plan into the general fund as well that helped yeah right but that helped us
still put money into the savings like we we got a ARPA money which helped us do stuff and then in in instead of just
being like great we've got ARPA money and this money let's just spend it all
we said wreck we got this ARP of money let's put let's let's the portion of the
ARPA funds that went to support the operating budget it was labeled um uh
well I'm forgetting the exact label but a portion of it was basically to avoid layoffs right that was the line in the
layoffs that the Paduto administration had projected they would need to enact they would need to move forward with
right in uh July of 2021 if ARPA was not passed arpa was
then passed and so the cost right to not lay those people off was part of the um
operating budget every year 21 22 23 24 and so that relieved pressure on the
fund balance and general revenue which allowed us to rebuild and in fact
grow the savings account the savings account so yes I mean that's you know I
I think that's I mean again I recognize the concern going forward but I think that that is worth noting in terms of
things that have been done over the past few years to make sure that we're financially well if you look at page 186
in that book you can see the number of FTEEs have increased by more than 200 full-time positions in the city in the
last two years so that's I mean we're at that cross point where
right you're going to like and those are positions created not necess not necessarily hired um but that is a
dramatic increase in that amount of time so while we're socking money away we will quick quickly and rapidly burn burn
through that money if we're not careful many of those positions are not general
fund positions the places we've we've increased the FTEs the most are in planning and PLI where they're paid for
out of fee revenue so Oh okay
okay all right well um I think Yeah again I mean right
increasing revenue i mean obviously it would be great there just there's so many things that I wish we could do i wish we could charge people coming in
the tunnel i wish we could do a sugary drinks tax i wish that we could you know I mean all these things that other
cities do right like to to increase revenue um you know um I wish that our nonprofit
partners would you know help in as well with these with these things
um you know because they you know if if they were forprofit specifically UPMC I don't know what the numbers like they'd
be 32 million or so a year in taxes that they don't pay because they're a nonprofit so I know that's that's a
source that's a sore point for for folks across the city um and obviously
something we need to look at going forward but uh anyway I appreciate this um I appreciate everyone coming and
having the long discussion um you know my take is my my takeaway is that you
know these are definitely concerns right but it also feels like these are concerns that you
know we have recognized for a while now and that you know have and we're working
towards them but I think that I'm hoping we can all continue to work together you know finance chair yourself director oh
she director gula OM you know continuing to work together going forward yeah
thanks thank you we'll move on to Uh Councilman Wilson I know he has a few things to say before he has to depart
and then I'll I'll make some remarks at the end so I hope people will will stay for that thank you Chair i have to uh
leave pretty soon here and I wanted to make sure that I gave some final thoughts so we have a lot of signals
that tell us that things aren't going in the right direction we have schools that are closing prt is um you know not
currently funded at a level where they could sustain the the current operations
that they have we have ARPA funding that's going away we can see the
five-year plan where we have not allocated money for the land bank we have not allocated money for um you know
all the typical things that we could you know continue to provide um the level of
service that we're at right now i believe when I look at the five-year plan
and I heard I heard um you know we're
over on overtime and in the first quarter and I heard this at the the
budget meeting which was one of our plans is to
um get more revenue with the um with the
uh not the cost level the reassessment in my understanding and I just heard
that again here my understanding is that that will not provide that much more revenue so that as a growth plan in
terms of increasing revenue doesn't sound like that is a real plan and I I
spoke to the county about this and they're not un their understanding is that that wouldn't increase um revenue
in at a level that would get us out of this hole does
anyone that controller do you have any thoughts on the
I'll let Nimita is the most familiar with this as our office solicitor yes so I think what you're referring to is the
windfall provision that the county has which says that if there is a reassessment then the county tax rate
has to adjust down to avoid the county receiving a windfall i can't remember the exact percentage right now but it's
quite small um above a certain amount in tax revenue that's right um the city
would continue to benefit from the elimination of the common level ratio being at what it is now below 60% it
allows us to continue to collect revenue and more importantly it allows us to continue to collect real estate revenue moving forward instead of real estate
revenue stagnating the hope is that this is not a one-time reassessment but that
we all get ourselves on a plan to reassess regularly frequently and honestly uh in a way that to Control
Heiser's point continues to protect our most vulnerable residents who have been in housing for a long period of time but
I do want to specify that the county windfall provision impacts the county directly but it doesn't prevent the city
from uh receiving revenue from real estate on a regular basis and the elimination of this sub60 common level
ratio would be a big help we wouldn't see an immediate spring back it wouldn't be that everybody's houses are suddenly
100% of their sale value and we're getting the total amount of money right like that's not realistic but we
wouldn't continue to see this so my point So my point is that my point is that to rely on so it doesn't sound like
we're going to get this is a long this is a hot topic for a long time uh it's been taking Yeah anyway it's it's seeing
a lot of different turns here my point is we are relying like what I'm hearing
from the administration is that the the growth pattern is is to rely on another
government entity to do something and I think that we need to have a real
economic plan i hear that a real economic plan and a job plan i'm not
seeing that at all what I'm seeing is hey look the permits look like this in
the year 2024 we must be good you know that was a good year we don't know where the next permits are going to come from
that is what or the next build the next um development is going to come from we Okay yeah loosely we do they they put a
permit in but we don't have any sort of plan to point to and say this is our economic development plan we're relying
on um from my understanding you know different you know non different
entities like the Alagany conference to devise a plan like that and loosely put
together some uh you know some revenue to to spur development downtown that we
don't even have all that revenue you know the $600 million that's that's that's there's a lot that has to come
together to make that happen and so I'm not seeing the level of commitment uh from the city side to really fix this
this um decline and I would like to understand more from the administration
on what the real growth plan i know that you've been you know quoted in the paper saying that you don't even call back
developers um like you kind of take pride in that so I mean that's concerning to me you know you said that
they had a really good time in the past administrations and I don't know if that's really a good direction for us to
go to go down um and when at this table I just hear you know the administration say that between the common level ratio
and what another government entity will do and the reassessment that that somehow is going to solve our problems
i feel like that's a real concern whenever we hear you know the controller say that you're we have to be honest
with the public about look we can't pave those streets you know in coming years and I think that's where we're at we're
just not being honest with the public we're not speaking honestly publicly about this uh and I would love to get to
a place where we're going to be um in a better financial situation because we
had these honest conversations sure so first of all I I Please keep your answers short we need to wrap up before
four and I need to say a few words before that so I actually don't have to say anything okay thank you no just keep
your answer short please and then we'll wrap up so first of all I did not say that a reassessment would be a source of
tax revenue growth i said that the reason that and for exactly the reasons Namita said um that we the annual
formula by which the common level ratio goes down is the source of us needing to project reduced revenue every year a
reassessment would change that would reset the formula and would stop the
downward pressure on revenue which is entirely artificial and produced by the ruling so I'm not claiming that not
claiming that would be a property tax revenue windfall or increasing taxes um
as a result of reassessment that is the solution only that the now courtmandated
cut to real estate revenue every year would go away for the reasons that that Namita specified um as relates to other
sources of revenue again I there simply isn't evidence other than rhetoric and
conjecture to suggest that we are seeing losses or or a downward trajectory in
investment wages um or uh building activity right so the the um all the
economic indicators including now two years of population growth don't support that claim
thank you all right so um I want to thank everyone for your participation i
this is it's clear to me that um this is daylighting a lot of what our joint
financial task force has discussed and that I take for granted because I'm a part of that but other council members
don't necessarily so um you know really important um conversation the ACER is
one thing it opened up a whole bigger conversation about many many other topics and my hope going forward is that
as we discuss um really anything that we're looking at it through the lens of
revenue growth and um expenditure m maintenance or
um you know consideration because when I you know my my observations um more so
since I've become the chair of the finance and law committee is that council although we seek to grow
revenues we don't have direct control over revenues right we can set the table we can um we can help set the table set
the foundation for an environment that grows jobs um and that helps to start new people grow new businesses or start
new businesses to grow our population to keep people from leaving the city um
investing in vacant land to get you know more properties back on the tax roles um
uh you know but we're not we're not part of we're not part of um you know a
conversation directly with the nonprofits to get our bigger share we we do have limited capacity to implement
new taxes and with expenditures the challenge is we do have control we pass
a budget every year but the process doesn't always lend itself to
um taking the deep dive that we really need to where we need to throughout the year right um we we look at it we
scrutinize it we do the best we can to digest a lot of information over a short amount of time and have conversations
throughout the year but the conversations throughout the year are peacemeal contracts coming to us without an understanding of how they fit into a
greater hole so I I'm I'm really looking forward to holding more of these types of hearings not just on ACRA and not
just as it relates to the controllers's office but looking forward to um the quarter quarterly report um the results
of and sort of the answers to the questions that many of us have raised and then you know perhaps having a non-n
November December um almost budget hearing on um as we dig into various
various departments and and getting questions answered from the department heads themselves um not just a budgeting
issue but a management issue right and and if we have questions for them getting answers directly from them about
um how they are viewing their management role through the lens of um saving this the city money or growing our revenue
sources too because I think it has to be for the next two years until we retire some of our big debt until you know a
reassessment happens a lot out of our control until you know tariffs stabilize or whatever might happen there we have
to take I think we have to we all it has to be everyone's job not just OM not that just the controllers's office not
just finance um it has to be all of our jobs to to view the decisions we make
through the lens of financial and fiscal responsibility so that's what I aim to do here I'm so grateful to everyone um
for their participation I'm really grateful to the council members who are here for for their great questions and
helping to daylight again the conversations we've had um you know at the financial task force and at um
uh even some of the you know council and and mayor's office uh leadership meetings as well so thank you there's
more to come and with that having exhausted the business of this post agenda hearing this meeting is adjourned
thank you [Music]
