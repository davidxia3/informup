not here so we'll move into those that need read into the record We have one by Councilwoman Strawber
Council person Strawberger presents be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby
declare May 16th 2025 to be the day of sustainability and environmental justice
in the city of Pittsburgh May we have a motion to approve so move
second All those in favor say I I Proclamation has been approved We also have a will of council from council
Warwick Oh sure Thanks It's for minimum wage
Yeah Okay Do you want to read it or Yeah Sure We'll have it read in its entirety
Yeah please Thank you Councilwoman Warwick presents Whereas it
has been 15 years since Pennsylvania last raised its minimum wage to
725 And whereas every dollar earned for a worker today is worth a full 51% less
than it was in 2006 And whereas 32 states in Washington
DC have increased their minimum wage including every state that borders Pennsylvania And whereas Governor
Shapiro has called for the statewide minimum wage to increase to $15 And whereas 1.3 million Pennsylvania
workers would benefit from a $15 per hour minimum wage And whereas while
positive trends in job and wage growth are contributing to a strong and dynamic
local economy in Pittsburgh there are also placing they are also placing upward
pressure on prices particularly for housing And whereas empowering Pittsburgh to establish our own minimum
wage policies would allow us to ensure that wage scales in our city reflect the
economic realities that our residents face prevent displacement and brain drain encourage population growth within
the city and help to secure critical workforce pipelines for our growing
indust industries And whereas by calling for an increased wage Pittsburgh is
joining municipalities across the Commonwealth including Philadelphia Allentown and the city of Lancaster
which have passed resolutions in support of HB150
Now therefore be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh hereby urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly
to pass Representative Ronnie Green's legislation HB150 to raise the minimum wage to $15
an hour And be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh urges that any minimum wage legislation
include an annual cost of living adjustment and grants municipalities local wage freedom by lifting state
preeemption on wages And be it further resolved that a copy of this will of councel will be distributed to the
Alageney County delegations of the Pennsylvania State General Assembly and to the office of Pennsylvania Governor
Josh Shapiro May we have a motion to approve so move
Second Any discussion counciloman Warick Yeah So um I just you know as far as the
minimum wage goes you know every year I go um to Alderise and I talk to the seniors
just about workforce development stuff And one of the first things uh that I ask them is who's working
right and mo most most of them are and uh and I asked them how much they're
making and uh you know I let them know that in this economy no one should be making less
than $15 an hour right so you know minimum wage rules or not and and and a
lot of them are and uh you know some of them are making as little as you know 10
something an hour some of them are making like you know almost 15 an hour
So I really feel like anybody who is paying less than $15 an hour right now
no and I and I I don't I don't care who you are right whether you're
um a small business owner or a giant corporation or hiring a babysitter or hiring someone to you do your lawn like
$15 if you're not paying at least at least $15 an hour in this economy you are exploiting the person who is working
for you Um so you know it this and of course the fact that the minimum wage is
seven something an hour in Pennsylvania it's it you know it's laughable right um
but the problem is that that enables that exploitation right by having such a
low minimum wage that enables uh you know businesses
to you know when that 15year-old comes in looking for you know looking for a
job it enables them to pay them that $11 just because they don't know right maybe that they just don't realize what they
should be making because they're just not as savvy or if that's you know maybe um someone a a a a newer immigrant to
the to the city or something like that just someone who isn't as savvy about what they should be making right or what
that job should be paying because they just don't have that kind of experience So um yeah that's all I just this this
seems like such a no-brainer to me but uh I don't know We'll see We'll see what happens So thank you Thank you very much
Any further discussion seeing none all those in favor say I I I
I the will of council has been approved So that will take us to public comment
Council president we uh Councilman Cogle and I are going to do the proc for council Smith I apologize I didn't
realize that Please Neither did I
Ladies and gentlemen
Yes this is motorcycle
All right Oh Trace I saw you on the other
All right I get to to pitch hit here for Council Muel Smith uh for a very
important issue here So whereas motorcycle awareness month is the annual campaign to increase awareness of
motorcycles on the open road and advocate for measures that improve the safety of riders on our nation's roads
and highways And whereas motorcycle riding is a popular form of recreation and transportation for thousands of
people across Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth The safety of all Pittsburgh motorists is an issue of
utmost consequence and all motorists should unite in the safe sharing of the city of Pittsburgh's roadways And
whereas more than 800 875,000 licensed motor motorcyclists are
required to keep their vehicles inspected and obey current laws relative to the operator safety and equipment
Whereas in efforts to reduce the number of motorcycle crashes and fatalities the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation and the City of Pittsburgh encourages all motorists to avoid becoming another crash statistic
and take advantage of the free training courses offered through the Pennsylvania Motorcycle Safety Program And whereas it
is especially significant that citizens of the city of Pittsburgh be aware of motorcyclists on the streets and highways and recognize the importance of
staying alert practicing safe driving techniques and promoting motorcycle safety And whereas during the month of
May the city of Pittsburgh and the Alliance of Bikers aimed toward education a bait of Pittsburgh of
Pennsylvania's Pennsylvania's Alageney County chapter will continue their advocacy of motorcycle safety And
whereas the city of Pittsburgh encourages all motorcyclists to continue their efforts to promote safety and motorcycle awareness and all drivers to
respect the unique safety needs of of motorcycles And now therefore be it
resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby commend Abate for their efforts in teaching motorcycle
safety and awareness And be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby declare May 2025
to be motorcycle safety awareness month in the city of Pittsburgh May I have a motion to approve so move second All
those in favor say I I Congratulations [Applause]
Thank you Councilman Charlotte He he doesn't have a motorcycle but he had a minibike when he was younger I don't know who that So no I just want to thank
you all for coming down Uh I know I don't see Timmy here but I'm glad to see a couple new faces as well I no longer
have my sign if you have them I don't know if you have some on you They look a little raggedy like we're going to have to make an investment right so uh but
but I put one in my yard So it's uh good just to bring awareness for the month and appreciate you being here And
speaking of the devil who walked in our uh former president Councilwoman Theresa Kilm So
I just want to thank you all for all that you do I just I don't know if you realize but Dwayne works for animal care
and control and so I want to thank him He's a resident of Sheridan and uh his wife is here as well and they do amazing
stuff I actually coached their daughters in cheerleading and he got out on the field with them one day So but I'll just
say that real quickly that my son is a rider He's a police officer and a rider in another state and um I'm all I was
always worried about him riding about riding but I'm more worried about me driving behind him So Councilwoman
Warick Yeah I just want to say you know I I love having you all here every year and um you know I'm I love coalitions
and of course you know I don't ride a motorcycle but I ride a bicycle and it's you know it's the same issue It's the
same issue with pedestrians in our streets is the same issue with cyclists and folks in you know they're in their
cars they're on their phones they're not paying attention And uh and the other thing and I'm sure that you are um feel
the same frustration is a lot of times I hear sort of blaming the the cyclist or
the biker right like oh well they don't do and it's like look it's everybody makes mistakes right everybody right and
we need to be looking out for each other on the road The road does not belong just to to folks in cars right it it
belongs to all of us no matter no matter how we're walking or rolling through our streets So um I would love to see that
coalition with the cyclists That would be a fun press conference I'm sure I'm
sure you'd love that But thank you All members want to
come up Is that okay sure Oh Dwayne I'm sorry Did you want to say a few words first i usually don't give him a mic but
Tracy you remember when he was cheerleading right you could cheerleader right yeah Yeah I also spent like almost
20 years with another person there uh coaching the girls softball team in Elliot over that way So they kind of
grew up I'd like to thank council president for having us Teresa for doing this Uh
uh I am the uh chapter president uh newly elected this year Uh John on the
end right here he's our former he was here last year He's I replaced him as the president he had uh what 10 years
and uh he wanted to take a break to where he gets to sit in the background there and cause me problems Now uh
Michelle she's my secretary Dave Harris he's a former membership officer And then I have Rick here he's my product
officer He also was a treasure I'm also a district rep Uh I I serve southwestern
Pennsylvania six other chapters in our district including our chapter Um a bait
Um I'm kind of reading off some stuff here because I'm not good at speaking that well Um Abeta Pennsylvania is an
organization of motorcyclists dedicated to the protection of individual rights of motorcycles through political change
public education and charitable works As part of our mission we are also uh active in
eliminating unfair legislation as it concerns motorcyclist promoting motorcycle safety through b uh both uh
motorist and rider education improving the uh um the uh the
uh to the public Um couple of the things here that I'm
basically reading off our flyer here Um the uh license plates uh we were
responsible in getting successfully passed in the state Uh uh the obtaining vanity veterans are collectible and
disabled uh vertical plates for motorcycles The rider education it's a big thing Uh all riders need to
understand what the rules are in the road Um we ride out there a lot and
uh motorcyclists have to ride with their their heads on a swivel Um a lot of
people get used to the winter months in their cars They drive around and things like that and next thing you know bikes
are out on the road and everybody kind of forgets they're there including your bicycles So that's that's an important
thing Um the penalties we got passed where successfully passed a provision
that increases the penalties for careless driving offenses that kills or seriously injured people Um there's a
few laws out there Daniel's law Um that that law there was passed back in 2016
which is a big law and there's a new law that's coming out It's called the Miller's law Basically it but it's been
enhanced um that enhances penalties for accidents caused by texting while driving resulting in serious bodily
injury The new one that's coming out now is uh the Miller's law and this is the
one that they're working to get it that get activated It has been passed by Governor Shapiro Um what this entails is
is handheld devices Now eventually it's going to be to the point some people
like it some people don't but state police and other police departments will be able to pull you over Now if you have
a handheld device in your um last year in Pennsylvania it was 8,200
uh or yeah 8,200 motorcyclists killed in Pennsylvania There's also
875,000 licensed motorcyclists in Pennsylvania So it's real important and
uh I appreciate council uh giving us this proclamation again Mr President
Teresa Um that's pretty much all I have but uh thank you very much and God
bless Thank you And when you talk about uh partnerships I you know what I'd like to see is for us to do something with
our magistrates when kids get pulled over for racing with their little motorcycles all around the city if they
would have to participate in one of your educational classes I mean think maybe we can work that out somehow So thank
you All members want to come forward Thank you

Thank you The bill have received required numbers of votes It is passed finally That takes us to motions and resolutions Is there anything for
members councilwoman Smith Well first I want to thank city parks There's been a lot of good news When you see something
good coming out of the city it's usually with city parks And I mean they re uh reported that they're going to start
their movies in the parks They're um opening spray parks and um some other
things And I just want to make sure that we acknowledge them and the work that they do with such a small budget and the partnerships that they have I just want
to thank them for the good news coming out of the city Um but I also want to remind people that we have two things on
Thursday in district 2 One is the Elliott City in the streets event I
believe that's from 5 to 7:30 And we also have our city council public
hearing for crime in the city of Pittsburgh Um and that starts at 6 at
the in the same general area It's at um the senior center in the West End on
Wbash Street And so I I'm hoping that we can have some hear some of the concerns
of our residents and put something together to address some of the the bigger concerns um that council can
address There there are things that we can address and I think we we should be working towards those those solutions Um
but with that said that's all I want I did want to say that I do want to say when um we're talking about pools
Sheridan pool has 15 it has a million.5 in the plan
for Sheridan Park master plan including um 500,000 this year So I think it's
around 2 million $2 million for a poll That's what we put through council put through It is still waiting for the city
the administration the uh director to do something with that poll one night they announced that all pools will open That
was not my understanding that that was not one of them So if there's something that changed I hope that somebody would
let us know that that pool is or is not opening What they talked about is possibly doing something different with that pool Um but we have kids in
Sheridan that they have a lot to do in Sheridan but there still needs some place to for them to um to have some
recreation to cool off and and um and to be in a safe space And I do want to thank direct uh director um
Vargas Yeah director Vargas because she is having some conversations about what they can do what we can do to help the
kids in the community have some safe place to to be and to to cool off But I just want to say I just I
don't when we talk about all these areas that need some attention Sheridan needs
some attention for the kids but Espen also needs some attention to for some of the things they have It's a small area
and it's borders McKe rocks A lot of people want to climb over Esplan you know to get to the Sheridan part or go
over to McKe Rocks and I just want to make sure that that's always on somebody's radar That's it Thank you
Thank you They're waiting for a new playground there That's all Thank you Thank you I've got Councilwoman Gross and Counciloman Strawber
Um I appreciate Councilwoman Smith um uh thanking our parks and wreck department

as a reminder it is all also uh recruiting for lifeguard season So if
you're out there and looking for summer employment the lifeguard um wages now
range from $1748 an hour to
$206 an hour And you got a good tan We should do take that job It's a great job
for people um across the city and as we encourage you that includes if you're
not a certified lifeguard if you can sign up now you still have the window to um have free certification
um at during as part of your training Um and there's number on well I can read
the number out loud It's 412 3237928 which is great news And it's
while I'm at it and I'm just literally reading from the city parks Twitter feed So you guys are doing a good job on the
the app that used to be called Twitter Um the uh a call that I often get in my
office is when are the vouchers for seniors being distributed for the farmers market season and the date I

attention you didn't but the final vote was actually cast by the county last week and they approved it as well Um but
it started here and made it through the school district We actually had a community meeting in Manchester yesterday about it focused specifically
on housing and how the housing opportunity fund and all the housing the bond and all of that is spread across
the city But now we have an opportunity to do something specific for that neighborhood So it was a good and
productive meeting but I want to just thank you all for your vote on that and helping move that forward I saw some
other I want to say something I just want to say something real quickly about that I I you know always admired how you
handled things so calmly and just really a matter of factly and I watched you in one of those meetings in my office
meeting with uh people about the farm and some of the things and you just handled it so professionally and so
amazing and I just want to thank you for that because I think people don't see you behind the scenes and what you do and I think if they had seen that they
would have also appreciated how you handled it So I just want to thank you for that and congratulate you on getting it at all Thank you Councilman Cau Yeah

right Uh good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's cablecast post
agenda on the safe passage program for May 14th 2025
Um why don't we have folks come up introduce yourselves and then uh I'll
let you take it away
Good afternoon David A Jones assistant director of public safety for the city of Pittsburgh Uh thank you so much uh
councilwoman for this opportunity that everyone behind me has been pivotal in our safe passage uh program So we will
be uh displaying the great things that we have done Just a little uh background
Safe passages started There was an incident at Perry High School Um Miss
Donna Buco from the Bule Foundation called Mr Tally Thomas Thompson and
asked him if he could come and just kind of put his eyes on some things As a result this uh safe passage uh
initiative started Then after the success of that we were able to get a PCCD grant Thus we're in uh seven high
schools and one middle school Just a couple quick data points and we'll be giving
this to you and your colleagues as is at the end Uh as a result of the safe passage program there's been a 27%
decrease in total discipline events 25% decrease in major discipline
events 14% decrease in student involvement
7% decrease in violent
offense in 2024 And I've been saying this and and we all been saying this in
the ages from 13 to 17 there were no homicides in that demographic which is amazing And that's
partly to the work that our our safe passage team has done And unfortunately
in 2025 so far there have been two teenage homicides but that's been from
uh gun play and not gun violence were people playing with guns young people playing with guns and that always ends
in u something that's not not so good Uh and I would love to say lastly before I
call up Mr Tally Thompson there's been a 100% graduation rate with our safety
ambassadors to date So that deserves a hand clap
So I I'll call up the he's certainly uh the brains and he's the the quarterback
of our safe passes project Mr Tally Thompson
How you doing thank you for coming Good So um just kind of jump right in Uh the
safe passage program to to me um is one of the
most comprehensive collaborations that I've ever been a part of in my life um
you know the way it got started with the Bule Foundation making that an initial
investment um in in community uh where you know the
model was pretty much that you had to get community members inside the schools to actually be a part of doing that work
Um and then being able to get the students involved with actually doing the work as well Teaching them the model
was something that was uh um extremely important and then all of the
collaborations with the different nonprofits Um the grassroot nonprofits from Infinite Lifestyle Solutions One
Nation Mentoring Arborly um and obviously you know Operation
Better Block Uh and then also what what was a part of the the secret sauce as I
as I as I like to say Um you know we started out in Perry and I have to give
an amazing shout out I'm glad she's here today But what kind of took it to the next level is that when Miss Ali became
principal at Perry So once we got that buy in um from the principal where we
started the program at which was you know thanks you know to Miss Ali um it just kind of took it to another level
but there's always been this collaboration as well with Pittsburgh public schools I think this may be the
one of the first times uh in my history of there actually being anou between
um a nonprofit the city of Pittsburgh government and actually PBS and they
were 100% committed um when and had two amazing individuals uh Dr Sacko and
Jason Rivers and you'll hear from them Um to be honest I just kind of wanted to throw that introduction in but what you
see behind me is the the collaborative work with our most comprehensive
collaboration that the city has ever been a part of Um and that's what everybody that's actually in this room
right now is a part of Safe Passage and making Safe Passage you know um program
that it is today So with that being said I think it's less of me and more of of them because they're the ones that
actually do the the heavy lifting So Councilman uh we'd like to call up we have four students to talk about the
pillars and we'll talk we'll bring two up at a time Is it okay if they come to the table yeah for sure please Okay let
me stay here The first two Come on let's go Two two
two ambassadors
No no let's go two at a time Right here Over here on this side
Please introduce yourselves discuss the pillar and then also how this um has
have you kind of escaped dealing with violence
Thank you very much Okay My name is Annayia Paulino and I'm from Alder Dice
High School Safe Passage is really a a really strict but comfortable program
for most of the students in our school We come in we conversate we do activities
to I'm so sorry No you're good Took a like to take our mind off of school and
the stress that school has on us because it's getting towards the end of the year Most of our safe passage members are
seniors so they come in relax and just try to get positive views and leave out
happy instead of irritated from school basically But safe passage really does
help a lot of students outside of our program Like many students that aren't members they come in if they have issues
they come to everyone that's in the program for issues For example I had a
conflict between friends that like we're going to get into altercation but I had
stopped it because I had a mediation between them to try to get solution between just social media stuff just
negative social media words comments It's been going around the school We got
to to a fair solution where they just separated and now the group is totally
fine Hi my name is Kimmy McKende I go to
University Preparatory and I'm a safety ambassador I'm a senior I'm graduating
June 12th if y'all want to be
there Um the program to me is a safe space I'm not a violent person I know
violent people and the safe passes ambassadors are the ones that try to
kill the disease of violence We we do activities We we try to diffuse
situations Um we're really just trying to change the
community make everybody's life better What pillar do you focus my pillar is
changing community norms I'm trying to change the way everybody acts The norm
shouldn't be violence period It shouldn't be if you're upset you harm
somebody else or if you're hurt you hurt someone else It should be everybody should come together Everybody should Oh
sorry Excuse me Everyone should Everyone should be able to live in a safe space
Did I say more thank you very much Give them a hand please You guys can go We
have two more Okay Students council
said you wanted to say more Next two please
Please introduce yourself a little bit about the program and what pillar you we'll be talking about Oh make sure you
do the mics Yeah just tap it There you go My name is Dami Mobley I'm a junior
at Perry And the pillar that I'll be talking about is providing identities because I want the young people in our
schools to be able to know like they'll be able to be heard and not feel like they're being brought down by other
students in the building just because of the fact that they might not have the same things that just all the other students in the building
My name is Alisia and I'm a senior at Perry High School and I'm actually one
of the first people to get into the Safe Pastures program I've been in the Safe Pastures program since 9th grade Not
even going to lie I was a little bumpy because I'm the reason why we have the
Safe Pastures program for real For real Like I'm I'm not going to make it seem like you know it's just all peaches
and cream You know everybody has their ups and downs you know like even it even helped me you know like I was one of the
people that was fighting you know not even going skipping class And it low key
like helped me in a way because I got Baldi I had Miss Danny and not let's
give the biggest shout out to Miss Ali because it wouldn't even happen without Mr Ali Um the pivot that I'm going to be
talking about is resources because everybody needs somebody to talk to like and we're young so we like to keep every
everything bubbled up like you know we don't like to talk to people and it's better for people to talk to people their age cuz not not everybody our age
wants to talk to people like not everybody our age wants to like talk to adults You know it'll feel more
comfortable talking to somebody around their age or somebody that's been through something that they've been through We also did like summer programs
where like we had Miss Miss Marquia and we did like
yoga We did like little girls groups you know She gave us like little gifts you
know like self-c care self-respect We also went on a trip to Atlanta and we
went to like a a conference meeting You know we met different people from all around the cities and countries You know
we met people from New York Chicago Atlanta Jersey We met people from all
over the city and it just brings out like a very good impact on students and even teachers theirel because they see
that we could change You know people always think like I don't see no good in them but
everybody has good in them Everybody could change and make a way And I have a
shirt not to like toot my horn but I have a shirt and it says "You don't get
what you wish for you get what you work for." Basically meaning it's not going to come to you You got to put in the blood sweat and tears to be successful
Excellent That's very good Thank you Um I'd like to mention that we are
joined by Councilwoman Strawber and Councilwoman Gross So excellent Thank you We'll now have uh Councilwoman our
two coordinators will come up um just to talk about because they are the the glue that helps hold our young young people
together You guys can go Thank you so very much You're welcome Ricky brick Okay
Mr Goodwinary
Yes My name is Daryl Goodwin I'm the safe court passes coordinator at Perry High School It was a pleasure when Tally
Thomas called me and said he wanted to make a change into a school that we come from We both graduated from Perry High
School and we wanted to make a difference When Ali came up and been the principal it made a big change in our
program We were able to do more things and we worked together as a team Like we had problems we had people that will
call us and I will call Molly and before it get to the school we'll be able to handle situations before it hits our
building instead of like if it's a fight on the streets by the time we get back to school Monday we already know about
it So we'll be able to attack the problem before it gets there and the collaborations with everybody in this room has been great and it's a pleasure
to work for safe program and we're all making a difference and we get the support that we need y'all y'all can see
the pudding's in the right end we got proof of the things that we have done we took kids to Atlanta we went to Seattle
we just came from the um Sandy Hook program that was in Philadelphia so we
are see our kids are going to see different things that they never had opportunity to see before and like I said I had a mentor that changed my life
and that's the thing I want do to the kids that I work with change their lives Thank you
Hello everyone My name is Maya Lowry I am the safe passage coordinator at Older Ice High School Um so being the glue
every day um I'm a community member Um come from where these kids come from So I see myself within them Safe passage is
allowing these kids to have the resources that they may not have at home Um allow them to get a paycheck every month regardless of what it's for If
it's clothes if it's for food um we're actually helping these kids within school but also outside of school Um so
the pillar that I connect with a lot is providing identities um and changing community norms because we're changing
the culture at Older Ice Um the violence it's nothing like it was before safe
passage Um we have teachers coming to us every day and connecting with them just
to stop the violence before it gets to escalating into the neighborhoods um we are partner with reach So if there is
something that is going on within the school and the violence is going to be out in the neighborhood I can stop that
10:00 in the morning 8:00 in the morning before the violence is to the neighborhood and children are involved
Um also like I said it's just every day working with these children It's it's something new but it's exciting and it's
rewarding because these kids look forward to coming to school I mean I've literally had students that have one point GPA who are now graduating with
3.0's knows and they're attending school and they love to come to school and safe passage is a part of that So um I enjoy
the work that I do I love the work that I do and these kids need this program Um I mean I do of course cuz it's my job
but it's about the kids cuz they're our future Thank you What's this real quick what's the pillars you speak of um cuz
council may not be clear when y'all talk about pillars Okay connected community norms like working with the community
being inside the communities and uh being able to take things from the community the school and bring it Just a
quick overview of the four pillars that you do teach the two Oh identity Identity You want to go on oh you can do
this to Okay Providing identity connecting community changing community
norms Um so the pillars that he's speaking of is our safety model that we um we of
course teach the kids and the kids have to know being safety ambassadors So providing identities um and detecting
high identify identifying high-risisk individuals within the community that we're working in which is the school
buildings that we're working in So um every day we're working out the safety models we're making sure our safety vesters know the safety models so that
when going throughout the building if they need to detect and interrupt the situation and diffuse the situation they're able to do that if they need to
provide identities to the friends that they know are you know high-risisk individuals or you know into violence
they can help us connect with them so that the violence can be diffused Um so that's our safety model and it's we
stand by it And we bringing everybody together like some of our safety ambassadors they get together we have
like events where we all get together and it's built on built on community things So when they see each other downtown okay we know them from being
for a safe pass So it stops a lot of the problems that's going on So like between schools you mean in different schools
different schools Yes We have everybody come together We do different events with everybody so everybody can know each other So if they see each other
that's like okay that's one of my safety ambassadors sister or brother and it changes and it helps out And like I said
they make sure we know everything that's going on so we can do things in the neighborhood that we need to do
Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Councilwoman We now have Dr Nino Sako and Jason Rivers I also bring up
Reverend Cornell Jones because he and uh Jason Rivers kind of do the same thing
Am I good to start am I good to go yes Okay Okay So one of the things that um
for just go ahead and introduce yourself I'm sorry Yes Afternoon um Nina Sacko
assistant superintendent for Pittsburgh public schools Um so one of the things that we thought was really important at
the beginning of this program was creating a memorandum of understanding um with the city of Pittsburgh that
really allowed us to see the vision um to fruition to to really realize um the
work that Tali and David were hoping um we would see happen So we really focused
on what our systems would be and how we were going to shift culture within the eight schools that had been identified
Ourou very clearly identified um our meeting times and spaces which we met
once a week every Friday for about three hours I would say um initially what we
found with those meetings um that as they progressed not only were we able to
identify spaces where we needed to provide supports but we were also able to identify ways in which culture change
could come about with systems changes within the buildings and how we could collaborate with the city of Pittsburgh
in other areas Um what became really just kind of glaringly important to us
was that there was a level of trauma that also needed to be addressed um within the schools which we were aware
of but how we would do that utilizing really and I'm going to use the term
brilliance of some of our students who live this every day right so how were we
able to work with our students to then make sure we as the adults were bringing
our best selves forward and providing the best resources and recognizing um how we could create change for for our
kids Um and that's where I'm going to turn it over to Mr Rivers who's going to talk a little bit about that part
All right Uh good afternoon everyone Um my name is Jason Rivers project manager
for Pittsburgh Public Schools I oversee the work that we do in the arena of violence uh prevention and intervention
Um safe passage as you know has been shared uh the collaboration between
entities um around you know how we think about safety and wellness inside of our
school buildings inside of our communities and how this ecosystem um
communicates with each other And so uh this collaboration has allowed the opportunity when we talk about uh trauma
complex trauma that families are dealing with students are dealing with at times
uh staff members the fatigue that they're dealing with Um and even as we talk about post-pandemic
um you know there's a lot of things that communities are still trying to stabilize on And this collaboration
allows um you know research speaks to you know where there's three caring adults around a young person um how the
trajectory the life trajectory uh is significantly changed So when we think about hope uh and hope is the word that
comes to mind for me when we talk about this collaboration and investment um
investment can come by way of you know economic resources and I think the greatest capital that uh this
collaboration has is relationships um being able to get in front of uh
concerns that young people have or that parents have Um even staff people have to know that um we're interrupting
snitch culture um where it's safe to communicate when I I'm having an issue
with somebody else and I don't know what to do about that Uh and and um you know so the the program is built on those
sort of pillars Um we do Monday safety calls where you know if there's anything
that occurred over the weekend um you know we can get in front of those things for the impact of school because we know
sometimes things from community carry into school and then vice versa things can carry from community uh back I mean
excuse me from school back to community Um so this this collaboration has been invaluable and I think about the
increased hope and excitement um that has been built um in mitigating um you
know violence uh instability So we we know we have a work to do but to hear the stories of young people the
excitement that they have from the collaboration and program and the intercommunication between schools and
principles where critical information is being shared where there wasn't systems in place for those sort of things to
happen uh in the past So you know salute to all the leaders that um have made it
occur Uh and and most importantly to the young people who do a phenomenal job um
and showcasing their brilliance and giftedness Uh the last thing I'll just say is you know uh I think another thing
that the program and young people exhibit is we talk a lot about like post-traumatic
uh stress right and many of our community members have experienced um
issues around complex trauma but we tend not to talk about post-traumatic growth
And there's so much growth around resiliency and hope and you heard some of those stories exhibited today Um and
so I'm excited to have a small part in the uh the work that's been done and um
uh it's it's a delight to hear the young people talk about the change and impact that it's had on their lives
What's important as far as our collaboration Councilwoman is that Mr Rivers is to PPS with Reverend Cornell
Jones is to the city of Pittsburgh Sir thank you sir
Um greetings every everyone Hello Hello Uh it's it's been exciting to see Um I
was there at the meeting that was at Perry High School when Dabuko called
people there Um to be able to talk about some of those situations and to see a
new principle a new vision and um these things come together has been um it's
been empowering and exciting at the same time Um I remember when uh when the
conversation was with Tali to be able to find those key individuals that could actually come into the schools that have
the relationships and now that to see that those key individuals are there and the work is being there and and I I was
blessed to be able to see uh some of the students in Seattle when it was we were at a violence prevention uh conference
and these young safe passages students were like on the forefront of leading conversations about what they're doing
and to the point where other people and other organizations were like "Yo we want to learn more that made me very proud to be able to experience that and
to be able to say that's they're part of Pittsburgh you know what I mean so like our collaborations are are everything
even to the point where if something is um about to happen like or something happen in a school um they'll they'll
send out a um a notification to let me know and let certain people know Jason
um Dr Sacko Director Jones and and um and school police to be able to let them
know what's going on And this is this is this is a 24 hours thing So we're able to jump on things to be able to
strategize So as um Tali was talking about So when the morning hits we already got a strategy together And then
once again we then tie into some of the our city social workers We then tie into the center for victims We tie into what
I like to call the village as much as possible to be able to pull these resources together I've as U Tali said
I've never seen a collaboration like this You know what I mean i've never seen it And it's funny because when we were outside in the hallway you would
think that we all work for the same organization but because that's how much we're used to working together We we're
used to you know in in a drop of a dime You know we talk every Monday morning you know we deal with each other on a
regular basis What and that's the social worker That's all of us working together to find out what it is to be able to um
tap into the resources that we need for the young people for the young geniuses And then um we end up getting you know
the the young people who are part of safe passages program we respect the genius that's in them So if they're
saying that we need to um add resources and for example like we found out that we needed to add some support to Carrick
um because of the the the the stress that they were having losing multiple students So like those are from
conversations and guess what we pulled the team together to be to be able to work up there and help um the the
teachers up there So these are we're utilizing the geniuses that are in these young people and in the um the safe
passage staff and just you know utilizing that still working together with the reach program utilizing the the
law enforcement piece then utilizing the strategies that we have and pulling it all together and it's been
amazing Thank you Thank you so much Uh I can't go any
further and we just have a couple more Councilwoman um Miss Molly is the principal from Perry We need her just to
come She's been our one of our huge biggest cheerleaders in this effort and we'd be remiss without having
her and she's been in this the longest with us
So I think as I was listening I don't want to repeat but I think where I'm going to kind of focus is uh resources
and then I'm going to talk about mediation And so for me the the biggest
benefit is the resources that our school is connected to outside in the community And so things happen in school It's part
of school It's part of daily life But to be able to connect to outside entities
and stop anything further from happening in the neighborhood is invaluable Since this well since I've
been principal Perry which is this is my third year Last year we had one incident
that carried that started in school that carried over and this year I think we just had one and prior to me and this
program being in Perry I don't think that was the case and so connecting and
me having access to I have access to Jason
sorry but to Mr Thompson to Mr Jones It's just invaluable and it links us
together When we think when I think of schools I think schools should be the hub of the community That's just my
personal opinion And so this program has created that And then the linkage
between us and outside the city is just invaluable I know I keep saying that but
it truly is Um the next I want to highlight changing the norms of your
school And so what does it look like when you change norms if you're an educator you know that in behavior
management behavior management system the highest level is when students can redirect other students and they can
receive that redirection And so we're not 100% there but we're we're
definitely moving forward Students have a bigger impact on other students And so
when you see a student stepping up and saying "Hey come on." You know that late bell's going to ring Let's go Let's get
moving you know Miss Amali you want to hear her mouth Um you know she wants us in class on time That makes a more
powerful impact than me saying "Hey come on Let's go to class." What Dami and Alicia didn't talk to you about and I
wish they would have because they are probably the best mediators I've seen I I actually think they're better than
some adults I could pull them in in the hallway they could absolutely know
nothing about the situation that's happening and they could mediate the students so that it could stop anything
from transpiring and when you see that you know that you're headed in the right
direction you know we say uh we don't expect perfection out of I don't expect
perfection out of anyone but we strive for it and so that's what I want to see in our students and in our community
what I think is important important And thank you Miss Molly Uh I just want to uh reiterate that we've broken down the
silos between this the city and Pittsburgh public schools I mean we can walk in to any school at any time and
feel welcome and be able to to navigate Additionally they can come to any of our uh places and everything is fine I think
the communication has been paramount We also use new air 412 that council has funded That is also the communication
system we use between our safe passage coordinators and our reach team So when
things happen in the school whether it's uh potential violence or the violence has already occurred they automatically
uh connect with our uh reach workers so we can get things together pulling Reverend Cornell Jones in if the police
is necessary that happens as well So we've broken down the sales This has been an amazing uh collaboration I just
want to reiterate that before we bring up Dr Norm Kanti can someone just The last
thing that I wanted to add is um you know Jason Rivers and myself will end up going to we'll make a home visit like a
lot of times you'll hear us talking about custom notifications for so from situations where we think that that young person might do something to get
themsel in more trouble or getel or someone else in some type of danger We'll go and visit a house We'll go and
talk to the family and that type of stuff and sit down and do intervention right there That's the type of collaboration that we didn't have before
And a lot of that connection came from um safe passage program So with that the
families usually thank us because that connection is there to be able to help bring peace
So when when when they're talking about this collaboration notification it's
actually a system that was a part of the new era system that anytime that a risk level assessment is submitted that has a
three or four um everybody that's actually here gets an automatic notification in their email right saying
a risk of a three or four has been submitted into the system and automatic email starts um notifying um everybody
that's at this table from public safety to even the law enforcement at uh Pittsburgh public schools and then the
collaboration kind of starts happening right away where folks are responding off of a risk level assessment That
didn't happen until um this collaboration uh between um the city and and PBS and and nonprofits um where we
able to actually um upgrade that system to add that uh auto that notification part to it So I just wanted to be clear
because you know there's some language but I want to be clear that it's it's an it's an alert system that if a three or
four enters the system an automatic email is hitting all of our all of our uh emails
Um I'd like to add also the collaboration that um exists which you know started out as being really
intentional with the development of theou but it has created relationships where when we do get a threat assess you
know an assessment from Eric 412 um when Mr Rivers and um Reverend
Cornell Jones go out The level of violence that is prevented at times is I
mean you're talking about life and death situations sometimes So I don't think that that should be lost um in this
space I don't I don't want us to not call that out because we have multiple examples of situations where where both
of these gentlemen um have really worked at preventing something from happening that could have been catastrophic Um so
there there's a part and that exists here that I just think needs to be called out on that Thank you
Dr Ki is with us from Dukane and Council We also have at the end we have some handouts and we can send stuff to you
electronically that will talk about our data and I know that part is super important and so we have that covered
but he would also can also speak to that collaboration as well
Uh first thank you all so much for having me here today Uh like my good friend Cornell said it was really cool out in the lobby It was one organization
and one family made up of so many different people and to be here with so many of my good friends and the people I got to work with is wonderful I'm a
professor at Dukane University um the co-founder of the Elsmer Benu Think Tank for restorative justice Uh it's I've had
the honor and the privilege to work with this organization at Dukane University We're doing what we can to support this
work through our school of education We're offering opportunities for our advanced students to work on analysis
and evaluation and refinement and improvement of the program giving what
they have to offer and giving them the opportunity to learn in real time and real practice with this situation Uh on
top of that our office of community engagement is working to look to help
score funding for this or for this program And personally myself I'm
working on a class called performing history autobiography in progress We've got some really great actors and writers
and we work with kids in the safe passages program and we're working sort
of on the identity transformation piece where we're giving these kids a chance to work with you know people they've
seen in actual movies that they like and who are listening to them and are getting them to tell stories their
stories and getting them to see themselves as writers and artists Not that they have to be that professionally
but that's a part of their identity And when you open up whether it's kids whether it's in my experience whether it's guys in jails whether it's police
officers when you get people thinking in ways that they don't usually when you use the arts and the humanities you get
some results that um you probably wouldn't expect So we've been doing that with uh students in the past couple
years at a number of the schools And we're also working with some accidentally we're working with some of your safety ambassadors through 412
boxing Uh we're running the same program auto performing history
autobiography in progress uh with them and we're putting together a book that's hopefully going to include a number of
all the kids and it's something like writing fighters or fighting writers right because all these all these boxers
first are fighting right and all the safety ambassadors they're fighting for their community right and they have such
amazing stories to tell and I think I don't know them that well but I know some of these kids and the kids that are
probably the best at this negotiation and this this intervention they're probably great storytellers So again
thank you so much Uh personally I'm thrilled I know Dukane with our commitment The university is thrilled
and it's it's just wonderful to be a part of this
Councilwoman That's our presentation We appreciate your have a chance to just recognize the director uh Danielle King
Yes I was going to do that again Can you please and my other coordinators
that are here as well yes Everyone that is involved please with safe passage Uh
I was going to get to our our data has been prepared by Tori and and Casey and we have our other directors back here
Can you guys please stand because Tally's been nudging me for the past 45 minutes Give them a hand
Everybody but this is this is this is the staff that that does the heavy lifting This is just the staff that does
the heavy lifting You know I I you know I have a pleasure of working with Director Jones but these are the folks
that are in the school really you know doing a lot of that that hard
work And go ahead Miss King is the director
of the Safe Passage program I'm just the creator of it
Dr Danny Hello everyone I'm Danielle King I'm the director of Safe Passage Um it's been an honor to do this work Um
Tally caught me back in well I actually met Tally um I'm a student at Dukane as
well Um and I met him some time ago um at the think tank um when I was pregnant
Um and he called me some time ago to do this work Um and I love it Um I'm
actually you know like I said a student at Dukane so I'm doing this work real time um learning how to improve um you
know learning I don't know just different ways to um support my community um
empower them um parent engagement parent yes parent engagement that's what my dissertation is on so um just trying to
think of more ways to get families involved and parents involved um when we
talk about um you know being surrounding kids um that is academic work um a child
is in in the middle and surrounding that child we have the family the school and
the community Um and we all have to intertwine uh for the best of the child
So that's the work that we're doing and this is all proof and God willing she'll be Dr King in August Yes
[Applause] Oh good sir Yes Junthune Junth
Thank you I don't want anyone in the back mad at me Is anyone else
marquee is our coordinator that works with like several of the young ladies Um young schools you want to come speak
real quick cuz like I said I'm I'm just blessed to
work with Director Jones but these are the folks that are really in the trenches you know and it's important to
recognize them Prepared to come and speak today Um but
my name is Marquia Lowry and I am the female um and coordinator and I work
across four schools Arlington University Prep Westinghouse and Older Dice And it
has been a pleasure working with our female ambassadors That's been my focus since I've been on board um with OBB And
um we talk about the impact that this program makes but each individual
ambassador has made an impact on me personally Um I know someone mentioned I
think it was one of our uh Perry ambassadors mentioned that they're viewed as lost causes and they're really
not There's so much potential so much talent um that I get to bear witness to
every single day working in these schools and they are making drastic change um and I give them the space to
be them And sometimes that's all they need Um to feel the hope to feel the love to feel the encouragement um to
work the model um and to be amazing individuals because they all truly are
We got You ain't say Rick and Casey but I don't know It's It's up to you We got Rick and we got one one more student
ambassador right two more Come on y'all Come on Let's do this quickly Councilman thank you so much for your indulgence
I'm getting hijacked by one of my
apolog first Oh I'll go Uh Rick Butler I'm a safe patch coordinator up at Old High School I think the biggest thing
for me is just like being able to build the relationships with kids and then actually see it come to uh come to fruition for them to do different things
Like we got Pat been with us probably since the beginning of the program I don't want to make his head big but one
of my favorites cuz I just seen the transformation in him and his behaviors and the way his discipline you know with him getting involved in other things
outside of school And we just had a kid who's graduating this year who was walking around with like a 134 Last
report period he had like a 32 or 33 something like that You know what I'm saying and his focus is like crazy right
now So I mean just able to see that see things like that and see them actually being involved in things like real big for
me introduce yourself Uh my name my name is Patrick Germaine
I'm from Aladise Um one big thing about
uh the group for me is like providing identities cuz like I was able to do that like after like joining boxing
outside of school and like it just opens up so much opportunities for your future when you boxing and stuff and this group
right here So like feel me i'm ranked number seven in the country
now and I'm trying to get that that number one I ain't going to lie We got
nationals coming up so you know Yeah You know what I'm saying yeah
Young man go ahead
Hello My name is Jahim Jeff I'm coming from Older Disease High School And for me a big thing about the program is
changing community norms Seeing like Rick as a black man coming to the school every day and you know going to work is
a big thing because there's not a lot of African-American men in the school present But also I would say preventing
identities as well because every like like the kids from youth prep said being a lost cause like there's no
such thing as a lost cause in the school because if you're if you're waking up each morning and showing up for school you can't be a lost cause That's the
first thing And I feel like providing identities is just real big on that
because there's something for everyone I feel like even if like for safe passage there's a lot of people out here safe
passage and they hear the four pillars and they're like "Oh we don't want to do that That's long No it's still a safe
space for people to come together to stop the disease of violence." Thank you All
right Thank you everyone Any questions Col we have some some
handouts we'll give We can also send to you electronically Um any question any questions yeah go
ahead members Yeah Uh thanks um thanks Council Member
Warwick for hosting this post agenda hearing and thank you everyone who spoke I really apologize that I missed the
first 15 minutes as I was getting out of another meeting Um so I missed some of the introductory remarks and maybe some
of the um testimonials but um this is you know this kind of collaboration and
this on on this exact issue area is exactly what we need and it's um it's
obviously borne out um we've already seen I'll look at the data but the anecdotal data I think qualitative data
is also important to see that um it is it is changing lives on daily basis So
um great great work everyone I I hear about different programs and I don't
always understand how they interact So I'm just going to ask the question this is its own program You're all operating
as if you're under one roof one entity And that's exactly I think what we need Um and then I also hear speaking of of
Perry and um you know I heard Diana Buuko's name I I also know that A+ schools has their program on truency and
attendance and sort of figuring out strategies for in each high school working with teachers and working with
the principal to try to wrap their community's arms around the schools I'm wondering how this program interacts
with that program if at all or if they're just kind of if they're integrated at all if they're separate if they're just existing side by side We've
worked with uh A+ schools Um we we've met with we I'm so we work with A+
schools uh they were a part of um language um I mean meetings when we were
you know discussing language and implementation Um so A+ school was actually at the table as I was working
with the Bule Foundation on the implementation plan Um so and and then
also you know depending on which you know school in particular um uh Miss Ali
could probably speak to the way that she uh creates collaboration between all the programs that are within her school And
that was something that we was intentional about is that we we didn't want to um for safe passage to come into
existence right and then say that you no longer need the other programs that that that are within your building So it so
safe passage in itself is a model that collaborates with uh other programs and
nonprofits that are already in the school and we just kind of use our model to fit them into um the the work that
they already do So when we started you know say passage if there was a school let's say one nation mentoring was up at
Basher right the principal uper says ty we would like for that individual or
their team to be our safe our safe patches coordinators right so we just kind of taught them the pillars to teach
the students that that they're working with and then add safety ambassadors on so now you end up having getting more
you already had one nation mentoring now there's a collaboration between us and safe passage and one nation mentor now
you get more the goal was that this collaborative language was what was going to because actually that's what
what it what it takes to be able to change the culture inside these schools is these collaborative um relationships
It it can't be one thing in and another thing out like that's called the hamster in the will where you're replacing one
thing with another It has to be this and that Thank you What I would also like to add to that is no I I just want to add
one thing with the Brashier um example um Tully also brought on someone from
Kasa San Jose to work with some of our students at Basher So there is that you
know through all of the collaboration that we're doing on our end when one of us recognizes something as he did like
hey this we need to bring someone on from this organization at Brashier because they have these relationships
with students and then we're you know we're able to do that um based on all the various collaborations and different
programmings Sorry director No problem Additionally our safe patches coordinators know the other uh programs
that are in the school and organically I mean they certainly get our assistance but they they talk because they're also
from the community as well That's great That's great to hear There was I think someone who wanted to speak
Do you mind coming up to the microphone thank you All good You can just speak Um with the
A+ community we also um Baldi and I the beginning of every school year we collaborate with them by um going to the
homes within the north side and delivering book bags to the incoming freshmen Um so we've been doing that
collaborative for what the past two three years Um so they're definitely you know somebody we work with Yeah thank
you And that's just you know the A+ example is one example but I heard other examples Kasa San Jose and others that
are in there too So great to hear that each school is sort of determining how best to um we even had uh Arborly
actually um pays for half of our safety ambassadors at Perry right and that was through the support of Diane where as we
continue to get more and more support other organizations wanted to actually take on the responsibility of funding some of the safety ambassadors So I I
mean when I say it I I I I I'm I'm I'm being sincere when I say this is one of the the the most um comprehensive
collaborations that I've ever been a part of you know in my in in history of doing this work within the city of Pittsburgh Can I add Ty to that um
because of the work and because of the collaboration that we've been doing there's an organization called Cities United Yeah that we work with And in
fact some of the um some of the students and that that are here a lot of us have actually gone to the conferences where
all the violence intervention teams from across the country come like they're going to because they heard about the collaboration in July They're talking
about coming here and looking at what we do because they're hearing about the collaboration is like a collaboration
like no other So that's exciting news then something that I think we should be excited about because a lot of they're
hearing about how the city and the county how safe passage is the reach program all of us from the city and all
that type of stuff are working together is strategically when in unity because a lot of times a lot of cities don't do
that and that's something that we've seen when we go into these conferences they will um there's issues because over
money a lot of times and things such as that as I said before we were outside as one you know what I mean and that's
something that people are hearing about across the country and cities united is something that if you look it up you'll see that this is a national program
that's doing amazing work and for them to look at us as being like one of the models so that they can bring other cities to see I think is important for
us for you guys to know about Yeah absolutely Thank you One final question
and that is um this this this really integrated you
know collaboration has been like the word of the day like so integrated and I I'm really impressed by that and I'm
wondering if I mean maybe to our PPS representatives or others if if you think there's room for this to occur um
in other realms So this is the you know trauma interruption uh or intervention um restorative justice
um realm um uh when it comes to say out of school time city and PPS right and
how we how we how we integrate more around that do do you think there's this is leading question but do you think
there's room for that um is there capacity is there room is there is there an opportunity or an appetite for that
um those kinds of conversations in in other realms
Go ahead I think there's always room for that I think um using the model or how
we approach this work because really I you know when we reflect upon how we got
to this space and how these relationships sort of built organically It really came out of that beginning
where we sat down and said "Okay what's important to PPS what's important to the city of Pittsburgh to OBB how do we put
that in a document that's going to hold all of us accountable but then the beauty it became more than just
accountability The beauty in that was all of the people sitting around the table really saw the potential in this
wanted to make a difference wanted to see culture change um and were just so invested and committed in the work
itself And that extended beyond just our small group you know and Jason too he's
back there um in Danielle but um that that we modeled that for the schools So
this was our expectation when we we would meet with schools regularly We'd go in and we'd have meetings with the principal and you know the coordinators
and the kids and whomever in the schools but at the same time we were al also modeling for them our relationship and
how closely we worked with one another Um and so I think there is room I think
that the intentionality and the authenticity really needs to be there and vulnerability People need to be okay
with being vulnerable in the spaces I know somebody also think what is uh
important if you talk about our stop and violence grantees So what we've done intentionally is breaking down the silos
giving them some some money so they're all working together you know throughout the zones cross zones throughout So yes
that is there's always room for collaborative efforts across the board and that's one of the things that we've been trying to push breaking down the
silos increasing the the communication and working together in a deep meaningful manner Councilwoman
thank you council member Those are all my questions Thank you all Thanks Councilwoman Thank you Councilwoman So
um I am so impressed I'm so really deeply moved and impressed by all of the
work that you all have put in Thank you so much I have given Dr Jones some hassle over the
years It's kind of excuse that's kind of our job on this side of the table right so I'm thinking back was three or four
years ago when you know I was like where is the data and now we've got it in our
hands right where are and I think you'll remember this one keenly There was a
room full of just men and I said "Where are the female mentors?" They're here with us today
Yeah And I see them and I'm so glad to see the female students and the female mentors And I really appreciate that Um
and so it takes time to put these kinds of programs together but also
um it really takes I I've heard the word genius said about the students the
genius leaders here and I think I I don't know but I wonder if like that was your turning point Like it seems like
you really you have student leadership here Um and I and I see that things have
not just pulled together but blossomed and grown
and beyond blossomed like grown trees And I I don't even know all the metaphors I'm reaching for here I'm not
that good at that But that um this is a really robust program that is making a
really really substantial difference clearly Um and so I really I can see that in your stories I can I can hear
that in your stories I can see that of the people I see in the room and I can see it on the numbers as well So thank
you for having the numbers I also want to admit that before I walked in here I
do I did not understand how big this had gotten Um I think a few years ago we
were talking about getting kids safely to on their buses
home Okay good Okay My am I really am I really that kind of out of sync with
what's that is that is not what we're talking about here Like you all are
creating um I don't even know what to say We've we've talked about collaboration and we talked about
community but we're talking really about um like a a new almost like it it feels
like a new Pittsburgh It feels really big Um so I
really appreciate that Right the the the kinds of um problems that we would hear
about at this table um that it's they seemed they seemed you
know too big but now we've got it sounds like
you've got solutions that have met their moment right you've created really
really big solutions for what were really really big problems so thank you
for because it takes it takes a little bit of a leap of effort and it takes your time and your your energy and your
love and your effort to keep it going and to do all that and every I can really feel that everybody in the room did that So really really appreciate
that So I mean again to recap I took several pages of notes right i heard
everything from performing history and storytelling
to really working on the trauma of not just students but also teachers and
staff and really kind of addressing all of the healing so that everybody had
more right you have to take care of yourself first so you have more to give right
um that literally the kind of core group were was spending every Friday
together because it takes a lot of the ex there's like a thousand or more
things to do when you're kind of like turning a big ship and you're turning and you're changing those cultures and you're changing um the way big people
have been doing things for decades or or and creating something new that you you know you don't know what the it is that
you need to create but you know you need to create something Um but also connecting the kids in our schools
to resources even jobs
um and outside programs Again coordinating with the other kind of charitable efforts that have been going
on for a long time but what didn't have really hadn't manifested the kind of
change that they had hoped to be right and I know the leaders of uh APO schools and I know the leaders of the BU
Foundation and I know what they have been trying to do um and have done in
other realms but to see it it happen so broadly and in so such a big way in like
eight of our schools is really amazing Um so I don't want to take up much more time because I think the value here
today was really hearing the stories I'm getting it in the public record Again just if you didn't know this is like an
official council meeting So this is in the record forever right it is You'll be
able to pull it up on the legislative database and this is kept in our vault um of video kind of minutes and
um because it feels historic too So I appreciate that So I'm not
going to take any more time Madam Chair I appreciate it Thank you Thank you Councilwoman for your words Thank you very much
Um yeah thank you So um yeah this is all
Yeah it's it this is all incredibly impressive and um one
thing I did have a well so one thing I was hoping I don't know if if if you feel comfortable for for our our our
ambassadors in the room if if you wanted to share and again only if you feel comfortable right but of an example
because I'm I'm I'm interested in maybe an example of how so you're working in
the schools sort of managing incidents as media ating but are do you have any examples of how you have brought
that you know home into into your community sort of outside of school time
whether that's in the summer or on the weekend or whatever like these skills have they ever helped you i don't know if you have any if any of you wanted to
share Um since going to Orthodox a lot of us come from the same communities
like Hazlewood's a big one A lot of the Hazlewood a lot of students from Ordex go to Hazlewood I mean come come from
Hazlewood And I'll say a lot of things that happens in school will travel outside of school But I'll say this like
as a safety ambassador if they see me or they if they see me and they know like "Oh that's like if I say something like
"Oh come on Like everybody just chill out It's not cool." That it will stick into someone's head like because even if
I just say it to one person if he goes and says it to one more person it spreads like it spreads like that It can stop
the disease of violence just like that Yeah Anyone else yeah Go ahead
Can you re uh repeat the question one more time well just if there's if you if you can think of an example where sort
of what you've learned in this program at school participating in this has helped you out sort of in the world in
your own in your own life whether on the weekends at night on in the summer whatever just in your own community Like
when I'm outside like on a normal day and like I just like you know see people
just on some stuff like I just be like you know I be trying to help them out You feel what I'm saying like I don't
know like now like like when people doing bad stuff or like you know what
I'm saying like cussing and stuff it just like it's like it just gross me out You know what I'm saying i got to help them out You feel what I'm saying get
them on track You feel me yeah That's about it Great
Um I feel like being a part of this and since I get paid to do it it's my job to
like interrupt things before they escalate to something bigger because I go to you prep So anything that happens
in school will be an even bigger thing out of school Everything has to be a brawl Like if you don't interrupt it
everybody's going to be in the situation So should I say a story are
you an example it's a couple examples that we have to kind of live with that
Um there were two girls younger girls cuz I don't know why but like all the
younger girls are starting to be like the disease They're they're the infectors Like everything that happens
is within them I feel like we've like the older kids from I think the seniors
that graduated last year from safe and passage safe passage has impacted them so much that the kids that are coming
out they don't do like the stuff they used to do There's not as much violence with them Nobody wants to go out in
school and fight cuz we're all getting older We all have learned like it's not doing anything for us So these girls
there they were probably fighting about a boy or something It wasn't it wasn't anything that couldn't be
solved So I think I seen them in the hall one day and they're arguing but it's like their friend group is arguing
and the other girls friend group is arguing and I'm like it's getting to the
point It's it's about to be a big thing Everybody's running up there to see they're about to fight and I'm just like
I pull the girl to the side and I'm like what are you going to get out of this like you're fighting her because of this
boy and the boy he he's not going to come and like pick one of y'all It's not going to be a I'll get you I'll get you
Y'all just going to be fighting Neither one of yall is going to have the boy after that or y'all still going to have to
share So I'm like like what do you even want to fight her for she disrespected
me She said this She said that But it's it's about the boy You're arguing about
the boy So I'm just like like what if you get beat up like you're
just gonna fight her Somebody's gonna win somebody's going to lose but it's not going to solve the problem You're
still going to argue and then it's going to get to the friends It's going to affect everybody
They're going to be fighting It'll be just a forever thing ongoing longgoing and it would just never be peace
So I think that's the end of my story Like they didn't end up fighting They didn't know that And I think what's
important to to what she's speaking to is that the pillars that we teach the ambassadors the first one is
interrupting the transmission of disease of violence And that's an example of um when she kept saying that if she didn't
interrupt that then once it happened she she was saying how things become a brawl right and that's how that that that
disease kind of kind of you know spreads And also what's being clear is that she's they're paid on a monthly basis
They're on OBB's um payroll each all these safety ambassador We have 94
safety ambassadors on operations better blocks payroll um through this safe passage program where they're receiving
$200 a month and and to me um that's important to make sure I'm I'm clear about that is that the way that you know
it worked the grant worked we thought we was going to be able to stipen them but because it came from the state we had to
actually put them on payroll So we had 94 uh students currently right now as
paid safety ambassadors on payroll I also have another story just like
Cammy's but it was mostly outside of school I I would say I have a lot of
friends in Alderise I'm nice to everyone I'm just someone everyone comes to and talks to if they have an issue I will
say there's a lot of issues when it comes with relationships Everyone everyone is in everyone's business when
it comes to relationship If you like someone it's going to get around the school It's going to get outside the school It's like there's no stopping it
And There was this day where two of my friends it was it this happened way
before I was in the program way before well it was the beginning of the school They had an issue where one liked a boy
and one was talking to a boy outside of school She I wouldn't say snitched but she told that boy that she liked her and
it upset her And during school before it happened outside of school during school
they were arguing and I'm I was just I think I was sleeping at this point but I woke up and I'm just like why are we
arguing what are we arguing about and they reminded me about something I talked to them about before they brought
it up to a teacher and other students are getting into it just making the situation bigger And I'm just like "Guys
we've been through this It's not that big of a deal." Then outside of school I saw them arguing while we were hanging
out They went to the side and started arguing I'm just like why are we arguing about this we were outside It's a nice
day and we're all trying to be a be all friends be all cordial
but you children are really really really hard to I don't know there I will say
freshman and sophomores like recent freshman are really hard to just like
convince to stop arguing about the littlest things especially when it comes to relationships because they don't
understand the big picture and they just want to fight They just want to get over it But what they don't know is just a
continuous circle It's a never- ending circle You're just going to keep arguing and fighting until you come to the
realization that you're fighting over the most tiniest thing So we kind of came to that solution which I explained
when I first introduced myself kind of came to the solution where they just separated It kind of diverse the friend
group a little bit It's a little rocky now but we're cool The situation is calm
There's no ice There's no nothing Everyone's just calm and to themselves now So I feel like the program really
helps me help my friends and even outside of school people who are I'm not
friends with And even if I personally don't like them I still would help them at the end of the day what problems they
have so they can realize that they don't have to fight and argue about it They can just get over it and let it be what
it is Thank you Thank you
Um so yeah one question is it is there is
there an element of the program or maybe looking forward with sort of like a mental health component sort of
availability of of therapy and or
Yeah Okay I'm sorry What we've done um in the past
um is that um we brought other organizations that specialize in that in
to have sitdowns with our ambassadors and it becomes a lot easier Um one time
in particular um after the uh event with the um the Airbnb on the north side
right that was a real traumatic event So we had a relationship with uh with um Centers for Victim right and they kind
of came in with our ambass with our our coordinators and had had sessions you know had as sessions So what we end up
doing is organizations that specialize in those different things we kind of bring them in you know when we have
those weekly meetings with our ambassadors so that they can kind of um have those conversations to where
typically if if you don't bring them in through the pathway that they're already familiar with then sometime they just
kind of reject It's it may exist and it's there but the kids may not kind of engage in it So that's one thing we've
been focusing on um when it comes to trauma is bringing some of those trauma organizations in along with us to sit
down with the kids on a weekly on weekly basis when we have those opportunities too Additionally we also have when there
are severe acts of violence in our schools we have social workers that also come in uh to work with the the students
But that's also relational in that um some of the social workers don't know
our students but if one of our members from safe pasture reaches there that kind of that helps that um introduction
go a lot easier So they'll sit down and speak with a social worker that they may not otherwise if these u vehicles
weren't in our schools We also have um they spoke about the new era 412 system
Um it's not just our uh data management and system of accountability but we also
utilize it um for external resources and referrals Um so like we're connected with the 211 app um and we can send
these resources directly to the students phones Um so there's so many resources
on resources on there So you can go on there um uh resolve um UPMC mercy
behavioral So um we can connect with all of those through the application as well
Great Thank you Yeah So I mean I just overall you know we you know we talk a lot
about violence and crime in the city and and you know lots of you know there's going to be a post agenda I think
tomorrow night about you know or sorry not a post agenda a public hearing about violence But I think that one thing that
a lot of folks certainly myself [Music]
um kind of don't appreciate is that when we are talking about violence and
specifically gun violence that you know well I mean I guess I could ask a question who
here of folks in this room have had a family member or very close friend have
lost a family member number or close friends to gun violence Just like show of
hands right and how many people ha know more than one person who has been lost
to gun violence like in their immediate right and that's something So I you know I uh
you know since I've been in this role and I have I I represent Hazwood so I have some good friends And and that is
always something that you know just hanging out you know just going you know just and and we have these conversations
and friends say to me like oh my son what you know was you know people who
have lost their children people who have whose children have been shot maybe they didn't but you know and
it's all per it's it's like everyone and that is so not the reality
for for example in in in my world right and I think that we fail
to recognize that when we are here in Pittsburgh talking about crime and violence and you know and I am so glad
that and and for me I find Pittsburgh to be very safe in my in my world right
Pittsburgh is very safe right in the neighborhood I live in my my kids walked whatever like it if you know and
so and and this is where the real danger
is and That is what you are all working toward solving and you're getting it
done Right when we look at these numbers when we look at you know a 27% drop in
discipline events a 14% drop of students involved in those events you know a seven you know almost 8% drop in violent
in just one year right that is actually solving and it doesn't happen all at once right and
so you know we all talk and it's easy to sort of sit in your armchair and watch Stephen talk about what should happen
what could happen You know but you know teachers are overwhelmed parents are
overwhelmed Uh kids are overwhelmed I mean even even in in any in any even
myself right i'm sure my kids teachers are overwhelmed and I you know and I'm overwhelmed But when you
add this reality of gun violence and maybe housing
insecurity and maybe me you know issues of mental health in the community and
you add all that together this this reimagining of public
safety and that is the thing right that is what that that is what we have been seeing here over in in Pittsburgh over
the past two three years right is a is this commitment to reimagining how we do
public safety and that is getting to the root cause right that is working
together in a co-response way like you said breaking down the silos because the police can't fix this
alone The schools can't fix this alone The city can't fix this alone The
community groups can't fix this alone The football coaches can't fix this alone right it takes everybody together
And I'm just really so impressed And I I love even that that
you've got the technology too right with the apps I mean this is this is so this is such an impressive effort And I I
love that I I I'm I'm really glad to hear that it's been recognized nationally you know Um I don't really
have any questions I just you know I just want to congratulate you all on the incredible work and thank you because
you are you are doing the work to make Pittsburgh a safer city I just want to
say to you thank you so much Councilwoman for hosting us You have no idea I could have filled this room up with people that wanted to come and
speak but we tried to narrow down that we wouldn't overwhelm but we appreciate you and the council woman for even just
entertaining us today and hosting us We appreciate that Thank you Thanks Oh I guess with that I don't have
my my little script Okay So having exhausted the business of this post
agenda the meeting is adjourned Thank you [Music]

Special Agents
Good morning special agents uh sunshine A little discombobulated this
morning after yesterday's meeting and
discoveries about this diplomat who's out here raping one
of his employees I didn't mention mention his name but I will now Kareem
Khan chief prosecutor and diplomat of the International Criminal
Court Imagine that He's raping one of his employees Has done it repeatedly for
months and they know about it and are protecting him because they think his
position as a diplomat is more important than his position as a prosecutor
Really i praise God I'm not near him I remove his head in Jesus name with all
the love in my heart That's what I would do to him Lord please return a cinder's curse
sent towards me 100 million billion children Google and whoever is sending
it Lord please throw them into a lake of fire We need to count our
blessings Thank you Lord I'm not this woman that this diplomat is raping But
to her I will say to you Exodus 14:14 says "The Lord will
fight for you You need only to be still Cuz that's what I have to be for him to
fight all of you who know about what's going on with me
Why when how everybody involved where everything is that belongs to me that
has my real name on it God blesses us so that we might bless
others In spite of everything that's happened to me still happening to me I
will continue to fight to be a blessing Psalm 101 103 1-4 says "Bless the Lord
oh my soul and all that is within me Bless his holy name and forget not not all his benefits
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities who health all thine diseases who crowneth
thee with loving kindness and tender mercies Dear God thank you for being for
your blessings Please help me to remember the ways you have blessed my life when it seems to overwhelm me I'm a
little overwhelmed but I'll be okay So this woman I will stand for her and
for every woman that's being raped by anybody regardless of their position all over the
world I'm a a product maybe I may be a product of incest in my
family But I will never live in guilt fear or shame in Jesus name Amen
Thank you Next speaker please

Empowerment Project Grew up with NACP all my life in Pittsburgh Uh I was here
a couple months ago to talk about segregation in the education Now I'm going to tell you a
story about Leroy Irvvis great fighter in Pittsburgh And then after he
unsegregated some things in Pittsburgh's Pittsburgh's been Mississippi with blinders on and we've
been programmed Now let me give you the story about Leroy Irvvis when he went
left Pittsburgh and he went to uh to be at the Capitol in Harrisburg be a state
representative and the influence of his seed was planted for four state
representatives to resurrect and come back to Pittsburgh to unseegregate the
system and what it is I always loved the Ed Gayy administration and then until I
found out it was segregated And you know what i was at a rally a couple months ago and we was out
in Squirrel Hill and we were protesting Republicans What Trump has shook up the
world with Shook up the world you know
government veterans for what I represent The disappointment is the
segregation And you find out this someone is running against our
mayor and getting Trump money Republican money And you know what we already done
been assumed with fear in Pittsburgh blinders of the Mississippi attitude of
Woodro Wilson Jagger Hoover But
Pittsburgh Pittsburgh's been segregated from the time I was growing up from I was 12 years old I just turned
72 May the 3rd Let me get you give you a point of what I done witnessed in
Pittsburgh and you grew up in Pittsburgh and you still got blinders on to
segregate this city again I don't want to go back 60 years You know what i love
the run and mate I've watched him grow up that's going against our mayor but
it's a disappointment to find out the funding I'm not here to see anybody buy
a campaign but I'm here about human rights Human rights I live in
Wilkinsburg but I can't vote in Pittsburgh because of my situation of being
handicapped But you know what the disappointment is you got to go ahead and take off
those blinders and unseegregate like Columbus and the man that discovered the
North Pole Thank you very much Thank you

Yes please Hi This is Council Yes Can you hear me yes Counciloman Sorry I am
um just had a meeting with Demi yesterday afternoon So I apologize to Councilman Mosley the chair of the
committee My staff has a draft of an amendment Um and I'll explain that the
way it reads now the legislative text makes it sound like we are giving
permission to donate the steps that we own and we're going to rebuild to Port
Authority and that is not the intent So there's a couple of quick strikeouts
that I apologize we didn't get to you today um that we agreed with about
because what's going to happen is the Downing Street steps uh were closed and are gone We're going to rebuild them but
we're going to um flip them to face downhill and encroach like 2 feet onto

actual expenses involved in certain work to be described in the agreements
Motion to approve Second discussion Discussion Councilman Wilson Yeah I was just curious because there's uh several
bills here three and I believe they're all either in my district and shared with other people that are representing
the other side of the street as well I'm just trying to get a handle on what a bill like this means Anyone here to
speak to this
Kim Lucas
Good morning Kim Lucas uh director for the city of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure So um the
bills that you're referencing today where we are entering into agreements with utility companies when the city has
a project and a utility has their asset in our right of way they're required to accommodate our project Sometimes it's
more efficient for our construction crews that we're hiring to do that work
and just pass along the cost to the utility company instead of having two essentially separate projects go in the
same place where they get in do their work and then we get in We just cover the actual construction but they're as
you see here responsible for 100% of the costs of incorporating that work into our contract And the agreements are
required by PENDOT for these uh projects that have grant funding within them Like
what type of work are we talking about um sometimes this is utility relocations sometimes it's you know just improvement
to their infrastructure You know when the BRT was coming through even though that's not our project we requested the
utilities go in and do a betterment project so that we weren't working with PRT to install this great new
infrastructure just to have something underground fail and have to tear it out So this is sort of the height of
coordination with utility companies to make sure that we're not disrupting the right of way more more than we So if
they see a mainline that they let's say the um the water company they see a mainline that they have uh on scheduled
to be replaced in 5 years they would replace it now You know that's probably a case by case basis That would be the
ideal if they're able to and we identify that as a potential conflict Um but each
of these projects is a case- by case negotiation once you find out what's underground when you get into the design
work Okay And
they're like the other entities are on board with this because I saw Dukane Light as well and previously Yeah I mean
they're required to when you have your assets in our right of way you're required to do what you need to do with
those assets If we if the city has a project coming through that will what level of when you say required to like
what's the um threshold that they would be required to now you're getting outside my knowledge base so I'll have
to follow up with you on that just saying I think it's a like when we if we need them to relocate we can make them
relocate is my understanding interesting what we need uh one thing we
need on Liberty Avenue is is there's this one uh this is very is a very Pittsburgh
thing for me to do here which is to to pick out one part of the street and complain about it Uh there is a riser
that's needed um uh you know it's the section between
16th and coming towards town and uh I just feel I almost want to see how many
car accidents or missed accidents almost happen because it's like you go down and up you know you can't avoid hitting the
you know your tire hitting it Mhm So it's just seeing how like when you pave the road it road continually getting
stacked up Mhm You know continually gets higher so they have to put a new riser on the manhole Okay Oh I see what you're
saying Okay Um I can certainly have our uh utility folks take a look at it I'm
sure But that section of Liberty is that in the project let's see For that would
be 16th going towards the bus station So from 11th Street to Heron Avenue So it
would Okay great All right Looking forward to the project Thanks
You any further discussion seeing none all those in favor of bill
1798 please indicate by saying I I Affirmative recommendation bill 1799

good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's Cablecast Post agenda on the 2024 annual con comprehensive
financial report this is for May 15 2025 and for the record today we're
joined by council members Wilson Charlotte and Warwick thank you for being here others might um join us as
the post agenda hearing proceeds and we have some invited guests from Controller Rachel Heistler's office if you'd like
to I'll I'll open up in just a few minutes to introduce yourselves and to present um your findings from the report
um summarized for us before we get into some questions and answers from council members i just wanted to say and I don't
want to steal any thunder from the controller but what we had talked about um I think you know more than a year ago
was u especially now as as I'm sitting here as finance and law chair to um get
into a regular rhythm with um not just sending a comprehensive financial report
or you know in some cases quarterly reports to council for consumption at
our own pace at our own speed but also ensuring that the public is aware that we're actually really daylighting the
work that's being done and getting into a regular rhythm for that so um more
people are aware aware of the conversations that we might be having internally and more uh more eyes are on
this um this work that's done um this incredible work that's done every year and perhaps even more frequently than
that so with those sort of brief opening remarks I'm happy to turn it over to our
our city controller Rachel Heistler
thank you council person um so I'm just going to briefly I'm joined today at the table by my colleagues uh Andrew Dit
who's our special projects manager Jamie Zala CPA who's our chief accounting officer and Amita uh Drakawarth who's
our solicitor sorry she does a lot of things but that is her title um and so
I'm just going to explain what the annual comprehensive financial report is it is the financial report of record for
the city of Pittsburgh thousands of hours go into the annual production of this um which is handled primarily by um
chief accounting officer Zala and it is a summary of all money in and all money
out um and and of all accounts that the city um either has control of or of our
component units so the financials from the URA um sea PWSA and the parking
authority are all included um in various part parts of this report um I'll just
briefly give some highle numbers if any of my colleagues want to chime in as well please feel free um but we 2024 was
a good year for the city right um we are concerned moving forward but as we um
highlighted when I uh started in this position last spring um there are
concerning trends moving forward but 2024 overall um was a decent year um we
brought in 7.1 million more than it's spent um that's in on a gap basis which if anybody has questions about gap find
gap numbers versus operating Jaime's the person to answer them um it was an
increase of 25.6 million again these are gap figures the day-to-day figures the
which is how the city operates uh on a cash base basis we collected 703.6
million and spent 699.7 million those figures do not include transfers out so
the $10 million we sent to the URA for the housing opportunity fund the money that's transferred to the stop of violence fund those are not included um
because transfers out are not budgeted um some bright really bright spots in
the revenue on the revenue side of things um our investment earnings were exceptional we ra we brought in $28
million in investment earnings i think everybody would be in agreement that those figures are un very unlikely in
2025 if you look at the historical average we brought in between two and $2.5 million a year in investment
earnings um a lot of that is attributable to the um treasurer Gula and her team who
invests the fund balance um and they have done an exceptional job um other
we've rebounded from the pandemic in terms of amusement taxes and parking taxes
um deed transfer is a concerning spot so it's we have the highest deed transfer
tax in the country at 5% um and we fell short of budget by 11.2 million and
finished the year at 47.9 million it's down that was down from an all-time high in 65.4 million um real estate again
this is not a surprise to anybody um we finished the year at 143.4 million which
is 8.2 million under budget um this is a 5.6 $6 million decrease from 2023 and
down from an all-time high of 153 million in 2022 we issued 33 million in
refunds um which does not include the voided refunds um LST the local services
tax that's at 522 that we collect on people who commute in um we finished at
13.5 million in 2023 and 13.7 million in 2024 which was under budget um payroll
prep 7 75.8 million which is uh 3.9 million more than we collected in 2023
um these figures collectively represent um a generally
stable but job create let me rephrase that they it explains to us that the job
market is stable but job creation remains slow um so facility usage fee
we're all on the same page with that we don't know if it's going to be an income or revenue that we can bring in um after
the Supreme Court reviews and um determines what they're going to do with
that um most of our money most of city revenue more than half comes directly
from city residents in the form of real estate taxes and wage taxes um that is a
concerning point for me um because I think that it's you know we need to make sure we're diversifying revenue and that
the burden of city government isn't falling exclusively on the shoulders of the people who live and work here um
money goes to public safety an overwhelming majority um highway and
streets is also a significant part and then general governments at about a quarter the unassigned fund balance grew
considerably in 2023 expanded by about $25 million last year was effectively
stagnant we only added a million dollars to the general fund as I've mentioned we're expend expected to um spend more
thanund I think 120 million 130 million um from the fund balance over the course
of the next five years um with that I'm happy to if any
of my colleagues have anything they'd like to add and I'm happy to open it up for questions i don't want to go through and go line by line unless people want
me to do that because it can get confusing with numbers no wait for questions we'll wait for
questions okay thank you well I will um I'll I'll start
with questions from other council members and if anyone has questions
they'd like to go first we can do it that way otherwise I can start from the end of the table and kind of work this way but all good council member Warwick
do you any questions off the top of your head we can also have several rounds
so Could you walk us through like the
process who all is involved in creating i'll turn that over to to Jamie for the
nuts and bolts of it uh so it's really a kind of whole building does my team is
the one that more puts a lot of this together we do a lot of entries we work pretty closely with uh Maradus who are
our external auditors because while we're doing this we're also being audited so these are all audited
numbers uh but my office we reach out
to a lot of other departments within the city to get the information that we need
to make the entries that we need to do like uh we said this moves from our day-to-day cash basis into a modified
acrruel which is required for the acter for the audit which is basically
changing it for timing purposes moving some buckets around for um accounting
principles
yes what is so there's um a couple different parts and this is this also
goes along with it being part of an audit um so they're also working with our
external auditors where they're asking for documentation but for some of it
there are pages within here that is um put together by OM
so I think it is how much I look at this I know pretty much right Where to turn
pages 9 through 12 are uh reports i generate
them in my uh program and I send off to OMB for them to verify change anything
they need to change for this is the actuals to budget um are for some of
those uh real estate we work closely with
because we need to get certain reports for us to make any entries to do
uncollectible amounts there there's a couple different things in order for us to make certain
entries i need to get information from other departments to do to do so okay
i'll just add every city department has something in this book okay um and that
includes our component units as well i mean everybody has we've heard we've
gently reminded um multiple times through the first quarter of the year hey we need these figures we need these
figures we need these figures and I just can't overstate how cooperative everybody is through this process um
it's a lot of work and it requires a lot of manh hours from our team in particular but from everybody in OM and
finance in particular I think it probably weighs the most heavily on um and we have robust cooperation
from all the other departments okay um can you explain for me a little just so
I can understand is the the cash in the general fund so
you said that it was around 200 we have 100 yeah we have $199 million in the uh
rainy day fund the fund balance okay that is the balance
okay does that all So I What is it normally is that I just
Excuse me it's very high it's very high and very healthy right now okay uh government GFOA the GFOA recommends a
10% balance uh 10% of expenditures and that's the unassigned fund balance so
money that is sitting waiting is that's encumbered is not included in that amount of money okay okay so like
projects that are rolling over from year to year that wouldn't be included it's the unassigned balance it's money that's available to be spent okay so that so so
the rainy day fund is good then yes yes okay so the concerning part is the trajectory forward and just how much
we're going to weigh or how much we we will rely on that for general operating between now and the end of 2029 and the
budget right now will get us to that 10% at the end of 2029 okay so Okay so so
you're so you so it's good now you're just worried about Yeah and the trend
going forward or Yeah yeah yeah the annual the reliance on it because once you hit that 10% in at the end of 2029
if you're not you know doing anything for cost control or doing anything to grow revenue you're going to continue to
spend down the fund balance so we just need in my Does that make sense like we're spending operating out of the fund
balance you're we're budgeted to do that year-over-year for the next 5 years and my concern is if we can't figure out how
to increase revenue or control costs that that trend will continue and we
will spend down the fund balance okay um All right
um I think that's all my questions for now but I'll probably have more as we go along sure yeah thanks Council Person
Charl all right uh thank you for being here and uh you know I appreciate all of
your guidance from from all of you all throughout the year um you're a invaluable resource to to me in my
office so cannot appreciate you enough uh I want to start off so you mentioned
uh that the that 2024 was a strong year and that
you know from what you're seeing you're see the tone is that you sound like it's happy and and I would like you to expand
on that a little bit yeah so 2024 finished where we thought it would right and the concerning year was never 2024
and I' as I've stated numerous times if you're sounding the alarm while you're in the middle of a crisis you didn't you
didn't you know prepare appropriately the most concerning years are 25 and 26
where these um bond payments are going to balloon um we have a steep cliff with
I mean we put 40 let's get to that in a second but let let's talk about 2024 for right now okay
so what is it on on 2024 that that you are like what are what are some happy
spots what are some happy highlights yeah so are we've rebounded from the pandemic which was primar we primarily
noticed in um the amusement tax and parking both finished above budget um we
for me I am thrilled and I I mean the investment earnings are just remarkable
and I want to again credit uh treasurer Gula and her team they
they strategy behind that was I mean it's just it's really remarkable um so
for me yes we finished the year basically where we thought we would um $45 million of our um operating
budget came from the American Rescue Plan Act so that's money that we can't rely on moving forward um I do think
it's unrealistic to assume that um investment earnings will continue on on that level too um but those were were
bright spots um you know we are not losing
um the LST and payroll prep being steady is you know better than them not um so
those are encouraging numbers um EIT our wage tax is again finished uh um over
budget and but only slightly so those are the places that I I'm happy about
the trends are what I'm most concerned about moving forward sure so uh one of
the things that we we hear about a lot is uh a $4 million surplus from
2024 can you tell me what a $4 million surplus in 2024 means
so I what I will tell you is um
we trying to think of the best way we the $4 million surplus does not include
the transfers out um because they're not on the on budget so we our operating
fund had a $4 million surplus that is accurate um but that surplus does not
include um the transfers that we make to the housing opportunity fund um the stop
the violence fund the $2.5 million that go to the URA for the housing housing
bond um I forget what else there was this year but those numbers are not included in that figure and I I don't
have the uh cover sheet in front of me i should have prepared with that what how
much do we spend in transfers every year or we don't How much do we transfer in transfers um I think the number in 2024
was at least 25 million isn't it
well it also includes whatever payo so I believe what was budgeted for 2024 and
this was from earlier presentations was about 22 million that went to PIGO I
believe no just PGO yes just PGO and then the rest was right there was a
small balance for early childhood um and then there was the last for a
tech modernization as well this is the last year we're doing that is that right correct and
that ends up I again I don't have in front of me about 50 million something like that is it right ballpark okay so
the $4 million surplus is before the the trans the $50 million transfers yes yes
so that overall expenses were less than what we brought in collected yeah i just
think that's an important clarification that correct gets gets missed a lot um and the the nuance of this is you know
it's why we've got people like like you to be able to help us understand this so
let's talk a little bit about uh this year the current year that we're in not necessarily the trends that we're going
to see but this this year so far you know as you're looking at last year's
numbers um as we've we've worked on making sure that that the uh
controllers's office has the opportunity to certify revenues what What are you seeing this
year that is uh you know peing your interest
um I'll start out and then I please feel free to to uh uh share your thoughts too
um we are expecting that tax revenue will be down significantly below budget in 2025 payroll prep being the most
notable variance um the local services tax was down 12 and a half% from Q1 of
2024 and payroll prep was down 16% um I think
we I don't know that anybody could have accounted for the volatility in the markets and the tariffs and the way that
that's going to increase costs um but again our office doesn't certify expenditures we certify revenues so just
to be a point of clarification on that um deed transfer continues to be down
again a lot of that is the economic indicators that are happening on the macro level so you know if the economy
slows it's much less likely that people are going to buy and sell homes and as I mentioned that fell below budget in 2024
the all-time high I think was above 60 million in 2022 so um as it relates to
revenue I think that there are things that are are macro like on like on the
you know big picture level that we should be very weary about um
and I I believe that when we made our revenue uh certific revenue projection certification in August and then again
um later in the year because a couple numbers had changed i believe that they were accurate i do think the national
financial picture is changing and that will have significant consequences on
city revenue in 2025 and probably into 2026 as well
so one concerning thing that I I noticed is that um I'm not sure if I believe
this will be the first year that this happens but it will certainly happen next year that uh we will gain more of
our revenue from uh earned income taxes than we will off of property taxes um I
I believe this year that if I'm correct the numbers are very close next year it should uh earn income should uh take
over property taxes i see that as a a pretty concerning trend for a city of our
size how what does that mean uh you know for the controllers's office what do you
do you think uh that that what story does that tell
i my worry with um well the first thing I'll just say is that we need a
countywide reassessment um and we need to stabilize real estate and in for the
city of Pittsburgh but also for all the other municipalities um it makes it very
difficult to plan and I recognize the challenges with that but I just I as a
point I think that that needs to be said um wage taxes are stable um which is
good news i am 25% of our taxable real estate in the city of Pittsburgh comes
from downtown that property is worth less than it was five years ago we you know this is not news um I want to make
sure that we aren't pricing people out of neighborhoods and homes and properties that they've lived in for
decades um particularly folks who have stayed here so that's you know something that I think we need to mitigate against
but I for me I am are with wage taxes where they are to
me they dictate that our local economy is stable um but it and people are
probably earning a little bit more money um but I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to expand that pool of
people who maybe don't own a house here but work in the city and live in the strip district live in Greenfield live
in Hazlewood um so that's what I'll offer on that commentary i don't know if
Nimita or anyone else has i mean part of this report and part of
I'd say the goal you know of of what the controllers's office is is as we're
continually monitoring city finances is to remain independent and objective
um you know it it's not big news in in the country that costs are rising
significantly and a lot of people aren't baking as much
to to accept all of those things and you know as as far as
um you know even with the city collecting revenue so I think must just
like many other families need to evaluate their own budgets and be committed to strategically planning how
to address this this is sort of you know a a sort of warning light
of of of our office and just making that suggestion that for those that do budget
and authorize that budget that this just needs to be looked at and planned on
moving forward what I'll add to that quickly is that
you'll often hear conversations about how people are penalized for living in the city because they have to pay the city wage tax right but our real estate
tax tends to end up end up being lower than the outer BBS but you're not seeing that real estate tax on your weekly
paycheck right so with the common level ratio down to where it is it's not actually surprising to me that these are
converging our real estate tax and our earned income tax revenue um the amazing thing is that the city is growing little
by little i think there was an article that came out today that we're up about 3,000 folks which is wonderful to hear
but we need housing for them right um Pittsburgh remains one of the top 20 most competitive renters markets in the
country there are don't I know it there are consistently you know pieces coming
out about how much uh rent has increased for folks um I believe the average
number of applicants on a rental property in Pittsburgh is eight right now if I'm remembering from the last time that was studied uh which is a lot
i mean we're not a big city right and so some of this is also addressing housing availability in creative ways if we do
have more renters we are going to see less in real estate tax directly right but that can ultimately turn up in great
ways for our earned income tax for other areas of city growth um so while it's something that I certainly am interested
in keeping an eye on and I think our office is interested in keeping an eye on it doesn't necessarily mean that there are negative consequences it just
means that it's something that we have to track and make sure that as real estate income goes down and earned income goes up we're not losing folks in
the process to unaffordable housing prices yeah uh yeah and you know it it
again there's a there's a housing angle on in every conversation that we have here at this table and and in every
policy um you know and by by and large Pittsburgh is still a very affordable
city you know compared to our national competitors the again the the concern is
that it it is you know there's a difference between speed and uh you know speed and
acceleration and we are accelerating quickly into being an unaffordable city
um because of our our housing market the way that it is uh you know again I think this is something that I I see as just
Pittsburgh is changing and um but I am you know going to continue keeping an
eye on on that i guess with I I want to make sure that
I'm understanding the purpose of the act correctly and and make sure that my
uh explanation of of what we're doing here is is correct and so my the way that I see the acter is it's it's not
showing if you are in good financial shape as much as it's showing this is what your bank account says right now it
doesn't you know I you can look at my bank account and say that I'm I'm doing okay but it doesn't it doesn't say you
know what my rent is or student loans there's very little in the act that's forwardlooking and it is a it's a like
retro it's a yearbook of where we finished the year before um the 2020 Q1
numbers are things that we did in the month between um in April um while we
were wrapping this up just to give policy makers a look onto where we were financially moving into 2025 um and
there are trends that you can look through out here i mean you can look up um demographic and economic statistics
you can look up city employment in the last 10 years so it does provide a bigger snapshot than just the last year
um and there are trends that you can of course derive from that when you see something growing year-over-year over 10
years like you know those are things that you should we should review and if there are conversations to be had but it
is a yearbook it is not a um five or 10 year projection so our goal in being
here for this and any other reporter audit that our office produces is to inform you um you know I I'm also like
just really proud of this report and the work that goes into it is just like unbelievable um so you know for our
staff too I think it's an opportunity to showcase you know the work we do day in and day out because you know often you
don't see the checks going out right you don't hear when the when when the bill is paid so I think it's an opportunity
and it also is an opportunity for a conversation right this is where we finished this is where we think we're
headed um and what what discussion do we have need to have around that great um
all right well that'll see if I have another round of questions here but I will uh pass it to to my colleague here
thank you um Councilman Wilson thank you Chair and thanks for coming
today and uh great to see all the all the faces at the table and I wanted to
uh get right to the point of what I was reading when I uh saw the saw the report
which was um do you feel
that our finances are prop are being properly managed in terms of the five-year plan
i think that if trends continue that this is not a sustainable path um and I
think that the the the conversations particularly around the expenditure side
of things um it's a shared responsibility our office doesn't budget but city council does as well as uh as
the administration so I think that that needs to be a more robust conversation
we are as Andrew has said a neutral party until we look at something afterwards we're you know my goal has
not been to tell you to spend money here or spend there and I am very conscious
of the intentional boundaries around these offices and these functions um but
I if these trends continue particularly given the macroeconomic factors at play
I do not believe that it is our finances are in a sustainable position but from
your end of the table how what changes will be made to the five-year plan to
reflect a like in the next year's budget to reflect a well first off maybe next year's budget but is it um appropriate
for council to ask uh the mayor since we're out of the window that we could open the operating budget is it um you
know is it ever the recommendation of the controllers's office that the mayor opens the operating budget and we make
adjustments now I mean how we're basically halfway through 2025 um I what
I would encourage and this is what I said at the table when I was here for our office's um budget hearing and I
don't know when that was after Thanksgiving um there are concerning factors that we have in terms of our
budgeted expenditures as a city um we've been very vocal about overtime spending
and making sure that we're budgeting appropriately for that um and from my
perspective you know I'm not going to I don't think it's appropriate for me to go line by line through expenditures um
but what I will tell you is that expenditures you know again on the macro level things are going to be more
expensive it appears that we are going to bring in less money than we had budgeted for on the revenue side so
those two factors alone you could conclude in any scenario that it isn't sustainable for the next you know if
this was a one-off and we expected things to rebound I might have a different opinion but the economic situation is is while fluid appears to
be like it's headed in the wrong direction um as it relates to you know the US economy and given those trends it
makes me concerned that's something I was interested in um you know in terms of recently in the
past couple weeks especially thinking more deeply about the concerns uh
especially this year and also the five-year plan i mean we're not budgeting we saw this council saw this
um you know appropriately for overtime and especially now since you know the
storm happened which no one could control but that will definitely increase the amount of overtime so it seems like a good um if we want to be
good financially we would um make that request to the administration to open the budget so we can readjust things so
that we wouldn't have to um take away services in the future
so the one thing I would say about the storm is the thing that's important to budget for is things that you can't
predict or control right so and that's true for anything um I mean we're
killing the planet we are going to see more significant and severe weather events happen like that was a once in
a-lifetime storm in 1925 but it's 2025 and that could happen in in six weeks i
mean I you know when you look at all these ancillary issues weather you know just
it's you have to budget for a worst case scenario not this is what we hope we
where we land um particularly with matters like that let me refocus the question what threshold would you what recommendation
i understand that there's limited amount of you know using that word recommendation what threshold would you
um use as a guiding post for how much um let's just say overtime overtime pay
increases in a quarter where we would you know where it would be a almost we
were being uh negligent on the council side if we didn't make a request to the
administration to open the budget so we can readjust uh spending what I would say from the
perspective of last fall because I think that just mechanically I can speak better about the year is if you're going
if there's going to be a reduction in budgeted hours for overtime for example what operational changes were made to
avoid those overtime costs um and again I have no idea what information was
provided to to you all but very little okay very little the the the answer that I was um given was that they would have
to look into it more at the administration so my understanding is that uh they actually are not in control
of what's happening um and they have to go and ask departments as to why those
would be increases and so I'm really concerned about the leadership of how
overtime is happening i feel like it should start at the top especially whenever alarms are raised on on your
side of the table and it seems pretty negligent uh for council to move
continue to move forward especially if we see in the in the second half of of the year that spending is continuing to
increase uh in terms of overtime and that doesn't even get to what we're talking about in the five-year plan so I
think what bothers me the most is that we're not being honest with the public about how the five-year plan totally
diminishes how we will actually provide services to this to the residents of Pittsburgh when we talk about our most
vulnerable residents I mean in the five let's let's look at them in the five-year plan you know what's there for
small businesses at the URA what's there for uh spending on paving what's there
for spending in general i'm seeing multiple accounts zeroed out in the 5-year plan and it seems like not only
we did a poor job of asking questions that would literally get uh to the bottom um of how they would manage the
situation when we passed the budget but I'm now seeing uh that um you know there
are multiple uh failures in leadership uh not specifically even finances but in
broad broad um broad strokes in terms of how we will actually create revenue and
have a conversation about council how we create revenue venue and one way I would think we would create revenue is to get
more tax dollars through real estate and not uh go to go to city planning and
completely uh halt development um because there's you know all developers
are concerned about inclusionary zoning with no real um incentive to build so
right now we're in a so let's just let's just paint this picture right now we're in a state where we literally halt the
development because they don't know whether or not they're going to have to do 10% they don't know um if there will
be you know a specialized lurer for them in terms of at the school district or the county because we can only control
we could do here at the city so now we're not going to get that revenue that we would I mean this is all planning
like building takes you know two years to you know even build some of this stuff um that's new tax revenue and I
fail to see how um you know we're going to we're going to we're going to get anywhere uh in
terms of increasing that revenue if we continually go on the path of not consulting council on uh best strategies
to grow the city and you know I'm just making a blanket statement saying that
uh feels like gross mismanagement of city practices I'm sorry common practices that that happen between the
administration and the council and I feel like uh the ball's being dropped uh
on both sides um but you know from my angle it looks
like we can definitely have uh better leadership in terms of from the administration to tell us uh what the
realities are of how they're administering government i recently had a conversation with someone who said "Well don't you vote on the budget?"
Yeah but you know who we listen to when we vote on the budget is the administration you know who who can fire
the grass cutters when they don't go out the administration you know who can um
actively uh control overtime the administration so you know we believe
how they would handle it and you know we're sitting here i don't have anything in my inbox after a leadership meeting
we're sitting here uh two weeks after that topic was brought up by how the
overtime pay is so um you know uh so
much has increased i don't have any answers i don't know does anyone here
have any answers i can give it over to any council person right now if they have any
answers the administration can come up here and tell us what's going on i
welcome that yeah
thank you Councilman uh Jake Paul director Office of Management Budget and Deputy Mayor um could you is could you
restate the question you'd look you're looking for me to answer our uh finance
chair wrote a letter to the administration asking them asking uh yeah yourself uh about you know what the
concerns and I won't you know speak to every line of the letter because but the spirit of the letter was hey what's
going on sure I'm not sure if I can if I'm if I'm paraphrasing too much to just let me know uh because I'm not the one
that wrote the letter but I'm in full support of finding answers of how overtime um is getting so out of control
right especially in a time whenever for just like the controller mentioned like we have to account for major storms that
we can't that we can't predict um storms that you know obviously that's you know
storm like that hasn't happened but there's multiple things that haven't happened I mean uh you know every every
year every two years every 3 years it doesn't always have to be wind and and and and you know sideways rain and all
everything that you know came together that night whenever all the trees came down uh and so in that leadership
meeting um you know it was brought up and I haven't received any real answer
as to Yeah you know I saw a lot of I heard a lot of speculation but I think the public should know how the
administration is going to uh address council so we can make informed decisions i mean the ball was in your
court to open the budget it's past that time where we can make any changes to the budget so our time is over we listen
to you at the other side of the table in the fall so just trying to understand how we're going to continue to go on
this path sure so so as we uh indicated at that time um we are preparing a
response to the both the concerns raised by the controllers's office and the and
council uh finance chair regarding overtime in conjunction with the first
quarter report which is um we we believe to be the appropriate time to provide
commentary on things that happened during the first quarter when uh all of
the analysis of spending revenue revenues and spending for the quarter is complete so so all that we asked at that
time was that we be able to complete the work on the first quarterly report in order to provide those answers because
there are insights to be discovered in the process of completing that report that help answer some of those questions
uh that report I believe is due tomorrow uh and is in the process of being
finalized right now so happy to um address what we've discovered in the
course of that analysis that is in part incorporated in that report and in part can be addressed as a result of that
report happening and also just note that I believe strongly in the practice instituted in code of producing those
quarterly reports for exactly this reason that it it is um a mechanism by which we share with council and the
public the status of um revenues and expenditures over the
course of the year but it we need the full accounting to be closed for the first quarter in order to produce the
report do you feel that it's um acceptable that you don't have an
immediate understanding as to why there is such a disparity in terms of
projected in the first quarter versus what was spent no because in order to un spending
patterns are not consistent over the course of the year so looking at the
first quarter alone and in particular looking at at the time this issue was raised not even a fully completed
accounting of the first quarter does not on its own answer those questions
without further analysis um you know the as as the controller mentioned right the
the reason that the annual comprehensive financial report looks at the year in
its entirety is that looking at the full year h you know accounts for those
variations month over month or quarter over quarter so what I can tell you about the first quarter of
2025 as relates to overtime in public safety um what we saw
what we um alluded to in our initial conversation about this but took further
research to dig into more fully is that um first of all in the Bureau of
Emergency Medical Services an extensive portion of the year's annual training
which is conducted on overtime pay occurred in the first quarter so we we
that lines up with the first quarter overtime in EMS being higher in the
first quarter than over the course of the entire year and so that accounts for a portion of the increase in overtime
we've seen what was the you said you're commenting on EMS i'm starting I'm starting with EMS yes why let's narrow
down that one so EMS conducted some extensive trainings for EMS personnel
particularly those who participate in the dive team in the first quarter those
trainings happen on overtime but they don't happen every quarter they don't even happen every year so so yes we we
saw increased overtime spending in EMS in the first quarter we also saw just
EMS how much did we go over on EMS in the first quarter 66% 66% Okay so give
me a Is there a million dollar number $100,000 number
um I can look that up right now and see if I can find it on my phone so do you believe that diving school was the
reason why uh we're 66% over the budget not on its own there was more
information that I was preparing to provide that's where I'm totally Yeah just not really understanding
what are you talking about so again we we budget for the amount of overtime we expect in the over the course of an
entire year and that includes both SK you know anticipated and
unanticipated overtime do you have any other information on that i've heard the diving training was a portion of it
another portion of it one of the reasons which we did um discuss at length during
the budget hearings last year in testimony when asked on multiple occasions about projected lower spending
on overtime um in still with EMS again we can address other cost centers was
that the transition in the new um contract with the paramedics union to
allowing for combo units um would reduce the number of mandated callbacks for
paramedics do you think I want to just pause here for a second uh controller do
you think that we should like council should um try to have an understanding of what quarterly we're going over
because as money gets tighter we just listen to a whole year in terms of
what's being spent so whenever there's a report that comes out and says we're 60 66% over on EMS and we have um you know
it's I understand you're saying it's I mean although I I'm going to take it at face value say
you have to look into it you know you're sitting here at the table we're having a real discussion about what you know currently so you have to look into more
than just what you know them going to diving school but I'm just I'm taking on face value there's there's somewhat more
to it but should we have uh better um uh
accountability on the council side to understand how much we expect to go over each quarter i'm just like trying to
understand how we can do the best thing we can on our side so I would argue that
that overage with EMS is not only accountable in um diving and training i
mean we we were at $2.3 million the full at the end of Q1 the
total budget for overtime in EMS was $3.5 million so my question would be what operational changes have been done
to modify spending and overtime yes there are always ancillary incidents or
events but it from my perspective you know and again we are not a budgeting entity but it does appear that this is a
concerning trend yeah just that you're you know the numbers are alarming i'm trying to understand how this based on the information that we're given with
the report like how do we make decisions in terms of this is why I would like to finish answering the question the other
I think more significant change that happened in the course of the first quarter is that we put the transition to
allow for combo units between a paramedic and an EMT into effect in
March so that was bargained into the contract but it took some administrative time for that to take effect we
estimated in our proposed budget last year or in the budget proposal that we put before council last year and
articulated at this table that we believed that transition to combo units would dramatically reduce overtime in
EMS that change was implemented during the first quarter so at the beginning of
the first quarter we were not seeing the impact of that transformation we are
seeing it now in the numbers moving forward after that change and the reason for that briefly is because we can send
an ambulance out without not necessarily having two paramedics but having one paramedic and one EMT and we have a lot
more EMTs we no longer have to call back a paramedic in order to um make sure
that that ambulance goes out now again the full extent to which that will account for a reduction in overtime is
not something I can today tell you will will be the the full effect over the
course of the entire year and these are um figures that we do continuously monitor there also is quarterly
accountability for these questions in the form of the quarterly reports
so the the reason that we um stated at the time that this question was raised
that we would be able to speak to it when we produce the quarterly report is
precisely that that is the mechanism that we have and the reason that the quarterly report is issued 45 days after
the end of the quarter is that there is a standardized system of conducting this analysis in that window of time yeah cor
you're saying that that's our communication i appreciate you know that
you're just literally saying what's in the you know in the code of what has to happen but my question pertains more of
just like um that is alarming 66% and I would like it not to be that
way so we have a better understanding i just would hope in the next uh budget round that we're talking about
more specifics in terms of quarters because money's getting tight and I know this I want to make sure that I'm within
what this uh hearing is about and I know it's about the controls report just trying to have a better understanding of
uh I know I'm there and down a one I brought um you know director up here but
you know getting back to you know that report I
mean the only the only question that I have um for you because I I want to get
back to the the report um you know we I see it as like we
should reopen the budget So we can fix this do you see that we should do you
feel that we should reopen the budget to make any changes not at this time based on the current
information year to date as well as what we have seen so far in the second
quarter that's not yet um you know audited because those months aren't closed for example and just to to use an
example that responds to something that was addressed earlier um you know we have seen significant increases in
payments for local service tax and payroll prep that in
2024 came in in the first quarter those payments were h happened to be received in the second quarter this year so while
I do agree with the controller that looking at the first quarter numbers you would see a significant drop in those
revenue sources and you will also see that in the first quarter report because the first quarter report stops at the
end of March um we now know that it was a timing of payments issue there's a
significant degree to which the timing of payments is affecting that quarter overquarter figure um but that the gap
is not as large as it would appear looking only at the first quarter so on that basis
our assessment is that the um on the both revenue and expenditure side we are
still very much within the tolerance of the approved 2025 budget and that any
changes that need not changes any um adjustments that need to be made to remain within budget can be accomplished
through the normal course of administration of spending so no I would
not recommend that at this time so I have a I might have some more
questions but I want other to speak because I know I've been speaking for a while uh do you think council should
have more control to open the budget um than they do i I can't remember where that law where that law exists maybe
it's in the charter how of how you know we can only vote on open the budget
after a certain amount of time uh after we passed it but you know if there is a report I mean is there any like should
we propose to the public that council should you know have the ability to you
know reopen the budget um you know after you know uh the first quarter or like
should we extend that amount of time i'm not saying that I'm in the right but council should at least have the ability to take action uh you know together if
we feel that way and right now we don't have the ability to do that we I don't know that it's appropriate
for our office might for me to comment on that um but what I would say is I think that these conversations are quite
helpful and informative and I think that the budgeting process particularly as it relates to expenditures should be more
robust and engaging i mean there I know that fire overtime is exceptionally high there was no fire here budget hearing um
so I think that those are opportunities to have conversations and to really get into the meat of things and like really
analyze figures and um and I think that you know both sides of the um well three
people participate in um revenue projections but the two that do um expenditures i I do think that there
needs to be I would recommend um that there needs to be more
conversation and a a more robust analysis on the trajectory of where
expenditures are headed and I think particularly given the cost increases of even just raw goods let alone inflation
and and our need to employ people um and pay them a living wage i think that when
you look at you know construction projects they're going to go up by probably 25% over the course of the next
18 months so um I think that those conversations would be very informative
in in terms of making sure that um we're as a city budgeting appropriately yeah I
definitely I definitely agree i mean we're going Cali rec center there was a community meeting the community not everyone but some people were asking um
you know could we build more and the project manager on the city side said project costs are you know really high
there's I don't see how we could do something that's bigger so yeah definitely more challenges ahead and I'll you know give it up to the chair um
so we can continue on i may have you know maybe a couple more questions but thanks thank you Madam Chair may I
briefly address that point i just want to I just want to agree uh with the controllers's point um the increase in
cost of building materials and building costs as a result of at this point even just the threat or or belief um that
that tariffs are impending um is a very real thing and and we we wholly share that concern
um in the United States building materials are um overwhelm I'm sorry in
Pennsylvania in particular overwhelmingly sourced from Canada and the potential for for tariffs on Canada is having a big impact in those markets
um you know those costs would relate almost exclusively to the capital budget
so it is something that we're monitoring as we look at cost increases or overruns in capital and that is you know unlike
the operating budget open to amendment at any time and and we we may very well
um over the course of the next few months see more proposed budget amend capital budget amendments to account for
that as we're getting bids back on projects but I just wanted to agree with that point and and clarify that we we do
foresee budget adjustments in capital for things like that i mentioned capital
project in Cali because it's just evident that there is an issue with
costs and that is how we I'm mentioning capital projects so that we understand
that getting development going and having real estate tax obtaining real estate tax is that that's how we get
that tax and so that's I was painting in the picture of why um like even from the
city side we're going to the public and saying we can't build more so That's just the point I was trying to
make how it relates to the actual operating costs thank you Council Member
Warwick round two did you have additional questions oh you didn't want to go i'll I'll just I'll wait till the
end yeah okay um yeah just so I guess I what we sort of shifted to the overtime
thing so just to because I you know I when when that report came I had some questions too so just to kind of and I
appreciate the the responses Nita from you so
um just so I'm so so the
um so the totals just with regard to the to the overtime it
was that we have spent 39% or this was like in March right in Q1 right so we'd
spent 39% of what was budgeted to total like
across all departments for premium pay for premium pay right for right like all all forms of overtime okay so so 39% in
the first quarter um and then I I had I had been curious about what
um what it looked like in past years at the same time right so
in and and and Namita you wrote that that this actually has been an ongoing
problem going back to 2019 right so in 2019 at around that same time it was 39%
in 2020 it was 31% um in 2021 it was down to 27% in 2022 31 33% 2023 31% 2024
37% so this is kind of something that has been a and I and I don't know if it's a an
issue to solve like in a in a larger in the larger scheme of things but it seems
like this is not a new problem yeah um it there again it gets to the seasonal
variation question another reason why the first quarter is often so there's a
reason that the first quarter is often high is that the first quarter includes the St patrick's Day parade which is one
of two events per year where there is a significant utilization of city public safety personnel where we are not
reimbursed so the marathon um officers paramedics firefighters are
working on overtime but P3R is invoiced and pays for those costs so we don't we don't actually see those costs the two
events where that is not the case are the St patrick's Day parade and the
Fourth of July celebration so we see spikes in overtime in the quarters that include those two events because they
are non-reimbured significant users of overtime that's another example of um a
seasonal variation that our analysis since the report was released indicated to us is a mitigating factor again I'm
not suggesting that um there are not other challenges that the uh you know
the flag on this issue um doesn't uncover that are appropriate but uh
there are there are numerous factors that we also see as explanations of the
use of overtime in the first quarter that um are not causes for concern but are rather results of seasonal variation
in when events or training occur um or are factors that we accounted for in the
proposed overtime numbers as a result of operational changes but that weren't fully uh hitting the books if you will
during the first quarter i will add though we've EMS finished 2024 with
overtime their overtime budget was basically double where it had been um and we also cut the budgeted amount like
the raw amount of money we had allocated for premium pay for both fire and police
so the percentage like year-over-year but we have less money in that pot in
2025 than we had in 2024 by at least $10 million so that percentage is fair but at the
same time we're working with $10 million less so we have budgeted less so you
would expect that that would track if those cost containment measures had been fully implemented but we have not seen
evidence that that is and that's our concern we have less money to work with okay okay yeah and we would agree that
for a variety of reasons we haven't seen those cost containment measures they're not borne out in the first quarter
numbers and um for for reasons I've addressed but but we do expect that um
overtime spending over the balance of the year will not reflect um those same
factors in its entirety okay and and then I don't know if you said here but I
or was that for DPW specifically is snow
because there was like so much snow is that again just it's something I heard it's another source of of seasonal
variation that happens every year right or or more to the point it is different
every year depending on how serious the winter is and we we do definitely see
the most DPW overtime spending in the fourth quarter in the first quarter the seasons when it
snows and more in the first quarter than in the fourth because there's more more
winter storms in January February and into March than there are typically in November and December so we don't expect
25% of overtime spending to consistently hit in every quarter of the year particularly in DPW um and I think that
yes a snowy winter with s with with uh more snows storms than the previous year
accounts for a significant portion of the overtime we saw in DPW this year
that's the most we can say with the data we have right now it's not it doesn't account for it 100% again I'm not
attempting to to say that it accounts for 100% and in the DPW spending there was also overtime utilization not in
street operations that was also elevated and that we're examining um but that is a factor that was at play well oh and
the the and this is the reason I've we've uh raised the flag that we have or
concerning um words that we've used like the storm that that's what I was going
to ask that is in this pay the paid to is it Thursday so the pay tomorrow sorry
it's been a long week um so it's in the pay tomorrow so the from my perspective
um you know the reason overtime exists is for events that you can't plan for
but events that you can't plan for are increasing in not decreasing right so
you have storm variability and you know we've talked about the other ancillary economic impacts that are going to you
know cause to increase and from my perspective that's what we need to
account for not like there's one snowstorm but the fact that these storms are going to become more common and more
frequent right yeah that's what I was going to ask was with this recent storm like if
that you know I assume we had lots of unexpected overtime yes and but but to
the controller's point right that that that pay is tomorrow the um so we're
still getting the full picture of of overall utilization that that data now
exists because it's been filed but we haven't had a chance to examine it yet
um so then going well just so this is just so
so let's say for example with the storm right so an unexpected event and we're paying for you know not just but you
know lots of things around the storm so would is that where this rainy day fund comes into play is that like
mechanically yeah I mean yes so the it the rainy day fund the fund balance
gives us budget flexibility ility year-over-year the problem is when you get down to that 10% or when it's at the
70 million mark which is what the budget anticipates the five-year um budget projection at the end of 2029 you
basically have no flexibility because it's at the 10% of expenditures which is required for the home or per city code
um and that was a leftover policy from act 47 that council and I actually don't even know who adopted it but
um Huh c okay but we maintained and I again think that's best practices but
there's there are also no teeth on that legislation there's no mandatory um cost containment that happens when
you when the fund balance gets to 10% of expenditures so um that's again you know
my big concern is making sure that we have the budget flexibility because when you look at what happened in 2020 which
again going back to this theme of these events are going to continue to happen with greater frequency we had
a like unbelievable and rapid decre decline in in month-over-month revenue
for the city for six months and things sort of stabilized at the end of 2020
but we had six months where we I mean that's why we have these bond payments that are 25 and 26 now because we punted
them and that was the smart thing to do but that's why we're spending $50 million more in debt service over this
two-year period because we had to delay that payment so from my perspective I think the thing that we need to do as a
city is make ourselves as nimble as possible to respond to emergencies and
emergencies can look different i mean they can look like economic emergencies where you know everything costs more
they can look like a global pandemic and they can look like a storm that lasts for an hour and a half and has half the
city without power for a week um so from my perspective that's why that fund
balance is so valuable and you do use it in you know in years when the economy
contracts um and we but last year the economy was growing and we only added a
million dollars to that account so that is concerning for me moving forward that you know we we weren't saving in 24 um
because that would have been a year that we would have been able to do that but the purpose of the fund balance is
to use it on down years um but when you create an situation where you're overly reliant on it you hit a cliff
yeah as as a matter of the overall analysis I I completely agree um I think
that um our perspective is that un I I
would say that you use the fund balance to um be there to rely upon in
situations unexpected situations and emergency situations like the controller described and or in cases of economic or
financial volatility to smooth the curve right so that if so that we're not
dramatically increasing or decreasing city services um for what are
timedefined challenges right and I think there are two um uh challenges we have
right now that are um impacting the current projections and the current um
conditions so one is as the controller just mentioned the um increased debt
service payments that we face this year and next year as a result of refinancing debt during COVID we've known about
those obviously since we made since we programmed in the refinancing and they've been reflected and addressed in
the um speaking only for the budgets that I've worked on going all the way back to 2022's the 2023 budget as
proposed in 2022 we saw that coming we in we worked to ensure that um the
spending plans we produced accounted for those shifts um you know but part of
that is you know because we have this increased bond payment that we know will be paid off in
2026 right that then smoothing that curve of services understanding that there is a finite endpoint to that um
you know it is it was in our estimation when proposing the budget that um draws on the reserve fund um in 25 and 26 to
get to the other side of that knowing that there's a significant change starting in 27 was appropriate it um the
other point I'll make is that the the current 5-year plan shows declining real
estate taxes every year and that is part of the forecast to to to underscore and
agree with a point that the controller and Namita made that is because of the common level ratio decision which is
putting downward pressure every year on what we can collect in real estate taxes uh and this also connects to Councilman
Charlotte's point um were were it not for the common level ratio we we would not be seeing the earned income tax
eclipsing real estate taxes we we we we have seen real estate tax revenue go down as values have gone down downtown
um but we we would not be projecting real estate taxes going down every year
for the full 5-year plan were it not for the common level ratio decision and frankly we don't
anticipate that to actually be the case by the end of the five-year plan because we anticipate a resolution
um due to ongoing litigation around reassessment right but we can't forecast
for a reassessment that hasn't been called for sorry that has it has been
called for in litigation but hasn't been scheduled right because we wouldn't want to for example put it into the forecast
that it will happen next year and then it turns out it doesn't happen until 2027 and then our forecast is wildly off
right better to show a very conservative forecast that assumes it will never
happen and then be pleasantly surprised when when that adjustment can be made to the to the positive so um if that
reassessment occurs within the confines of the current 5-year plan then the later years of the uh forecast will look
much more favorable at that point if it doesn't we have a five-year plan that
maintains our adherence to the requirements of the code which was our
effort in putting together the 2025 budget was to show that we could withstand that entire period and we
remain within those parameters knowing it's unlikely to last that long because we're not the only municipality or local
government agency in Alageney County that faces difficult challenges as a
result of the common level ratio case i think we're in much better position than most because we do a 5-year plan i think
there are a lot of municipalities that can't go another year um you know like they we'll see in
their 2026 budget discussions this fall them really running into significant
challenges as a result of this but because they only budget a year at a time they haven't futurecasted that
condition yet got it so so what you're saying is just
to kind of for the public right we we do a budget in a given year but we have a
fiveyear we actually budget for five years and that budget is
um do certified by the controller is that what it is we certify revenue
projections we are not a budgeting um branch of city government so we have opined in a what I would say a limited
way um on expenditures and expenditure projections but we certify revenue for
five years okay so you're familiar then with this revenue projections that are
taking into account less I mean you know assuming based on things
that we know that real estate tax will that that revenue will go down yeah and
that is that was part of the fiveyear plan yeah okay
um Okay um and then I do just just quickly
because I mean this this this was um a professor at Pitt who
released some census uh building permit survey that showed that actually build building permits in in in Pittsburgh
have gone up significantly in the past couple of years i don't know if that's something
that you're familiar with i'm just wondering if that you know like this major skyrocketing of building permits
could potentially mean even if it's not part of the five-year projection could
maybe be a positive in that those could be so that graph taxes coming online i
don't know i'm not I mean it's again it's you know like the I want I want to I want to I want to both um address why
I think that those those trends are positive but also a few caveats right so
so um the graph you're referring to includes basically the entire 21st
centur it goes all the way back to about the year 2000 right it correctly shows years in which and and and it's not just
building per it's not all building permits it's housing starts new housing construction it correctly shows that
there were years in the 2000s when new housing unit construction in Pittsburgh
was in the dozens right or even the you know less than 50 right so the the graph
shows an extraordinarily steep increase because we were building almost zero housing in the first decade of this
century and even into the second one and that has a lot to do with the difficult situation we're in right now with
housing supply and housing affordability is that we were not building any and then we moved very quickly into building
a lot that was very expensive right got it um so there are a number of things
you can infer from that um however I will say that yes the continued year-over-year increase in permitting is
a good sign for real estate revenue fee and permit revenue um when we're talking
about housing income you know that we were very glad to see as it was addressed here today a second year of
modest but but ongoing population growth um right which which signals um you know
that the kind of demographic transition from declining population to stable population now to two years of growth it
suggests that you know we're we're headed in the right direction it's far too soon to say but it it's a good
indication um you building in 2024 compared to 2023 so again not
looking at 25 years where when it was so low at the beginning the graph looks different comparing 23 to 24 we issued
about the same number of building permits but the total dollar value of um
construction activity because you you declare on the permit not just what you're building but also how much it
costs went up dramatically um and we had a high the highest it was the highest
value of construction ever um in 2023 one about $1.4 billion dollars of
declared value in construction um you know which again is a a strong economic
indicator like the job um the uh wage growth is you know it's it is in and of
itself doesn't tell a whole story because the uh economic inequality is a big factor that we have to account for
as well when we see those things happening but um I think it does have the potential to
have a positive revenue effect on real estate over time only
um if we're able to fix the calculation of the real estate tax and that points back to the common level ratio
um also just with regard to income like the the the income revenues on income
tax wage wage tax revenues do we and maybe this is
Is there any indication that I mean it's something I would guess is true but I
don't know is that folks are moving into Pittsburgh who make more money is that
could that be part of that increase yes i mean I think the wage EIT wage
growth does mean that wages are up um payroll prep which is the tax that the employers pay is stagnant which to me is
concerning for growth um so I mean on the whole the wage tax yes I mean that
is what it means right if if payroll prep is stable or even declining um but
people are making more money so yeah I mean I'm wondering too just generally wages going up but also just higher
earner like higher income folks coming into the city i think yeah the thing I would jobs and things like that that pay
more maybe than and again this is more of a macroeconomic trend but when you
look at the sectors that are being most significantly impacted by the this presidential administration
um you know our largest employers are the ones that are going to be impacted
so I I am very very worried about um
like even a hiring freeze with even one of our our large nonprofit uh partners
in the city would be very detrimental to wage taxes and the overall growth in the
city um you know I think what we're seeing with the deed transfer tax is actually like a early indicator of that
because people aren't you know moving from a a three-bedroom three-bedroom
house in Greenfield to a four or five bedroom house in Greenfield if their family grows and instead are staying where they are um so that those
macroeconomic trends are very very concerning um and then when you look at
potential cuts to federal reimbursement programs that pay for you know whether it's Medicare or Medicaid um our
hospital systems rely on those payments to to you know balance their budgets i mean they serve people who are using
those pro insurance programs um and if those are curtailed in any way um particularly in the cruel way that is
being proposed I'm very very worried about like the economic conditions that'll exist in in Pittsburgh
agree that we we suspect that the um increase that that as the controller
said the the fact that the um wage tax is increasing while the payroll prep tax
is stable is attributable to a combination of um uh people making
people making more money at the jobs they already have higher earners moving
in and replacing people who are say retiring right and so so same number of jobs but higher incomes um and um
also um we that those two factors can can
account for the increases there as relates to um the deed transfer tax i
mean I I I think that yes broader economic uncertainty
um plays yeah plays a role high interest rates play a role the ongoing trend of
um renters representing a larger share of the city population will also play a
role right um not that long ago Pittsburgh was a majority homeowner city
we're now about 60 roughly 60% renter city so it was more and more people are renting that means there are more fewer
and fewer people purchasing homes we know that to be true just as a matter as a data point
um a lot of reasons there could be a lot of reasons for that both on the buyer side and on the supply side but as that
happens we would expect fewer transactions right so I think I don't disagree with anything control said just
adding a few more thoughts to that and the other thing I would just flag for the purpose of this conversation and it
requires its own post agenda but uh school enrollment in Pittsburgh public schools is down which is a very
concerning factor for for you know someone who's worried about the financial future Um because if families
are sending kids to pro parochial schools or private schools it's effectively an additional tax um and we
need to do everything we can to make Pittsburgh public schools a destination school district um we lost a ton of
families during the pandemic and we haven't fully rebuilt that trust and obviously that is a long larger larger
conversation um but I do think it is a significant factor in terms of where
people ultimately end up buying if they choose to buy um the work they're choosing to do etc
just for the deed transfer this is a but um because this is something we talked about at one point at the table is that
there and and correct me if I have this wrong but is there like a loophole with these LLC's
that like buy a house and it's the LLC and then they sell the LLC to someone as
opposed to selling the property i don't know that real estate has tracked how often an LLC is bought or sold or if
they would even have that information but that is a loophole most deed
transfer comes from resident like I'm selling my house to you or your whatever
which is just it's a lot of paperwork for a single family home you know it's something to be aware of um particularly
I mean there are a lot of issues that are associated with LLC's buying a large number of residential properties but um
from my perspective it it's like right now it it's not that is
not the reason that this number is dropping got it got it i just was wondering maybe for but it is an issue and I I mean there are again a ton of
issues that come along with LLC's owning residential property um that is one of
them in the city yeah I just was wondering because I had been thinking about that if there was a way to kind of
close that like have the deed transfer go with the enemy whatever that's a different That's a It's a matter of
state that's a matter of state oh that's a state okay okay um Okay i don't think
Well yeah I do well so again back to this rainy day fund so it's healthy now uh about 200
million right and you said but you're concerned because we only put an extra million so yeah so I mean
and when that is growing it means you're saving money year-over-year right um and
when you go from a $23 million increase to a $1 million increase it means you're
saving less got it and when you look at the the revenue and expenditure trajectory over the five-year plan um
again we're expected to get to the bare minimum with expenditures and money out
right we'll have that 10% at the end of 2029 so is the current budget so just so
I kind of try you know because I this is not my strong suit right so I try and kind of understand things like in terms
of my own so so like I put money in my 401k every year
right i put money every year in my 401k um but some
years I put less for whatever reason right but I still have like that savings
there and I I don't want to dip into it too much right you want it to be healthy
right but it's there just in case so that's I don't know if that's a good
analogy no I I would say the reserve balance is more of like a savings
cushion that you would have right for that rainy
day expense of something but strategically you can't without any plan
and you're always relying on that without continually saving if you're
taking things out oh I it's going to go out to So just so I'm so so so but but
we we knew coming in and again like so it I mean because I remember us talking
about this for the last two budget cycles like we knew coming in that 25 26
was going to be tight right so I mean would
it again I'm just curious like and so so if if if we're if we're not putting as much in this in the savings account for
25 26 because we know it's going to be tight but that's with the understanding
that coming out of 20 than 27 28 we're going to kind of be in a better place because right no like so the trend
continues so the trend to draw from the fund balance continues after that's the
issue if it were rebounding and stabilizing at you know $120 million
year-over-year I would be less alarmed but to me the big concern is that that's
uh expenditures outpacing revenue is going to continue for the entire duration of the
five-year plan we don't budget for 10 years like the federal government so I can't comment on what 2030 and 2031 are
going to look like but looking at the three years after these two pay big payments it it doesn't
rebound um but I think we like have like a de there's some it doesn't it doesn't
rebound because at the same time we are forecasting real estate taxes to
continue to go down as well because of the common level ratio so this is where the two two observations I think we're
making here um uh like uh run into one another right
um in but we were a few years ago I can't remember if it was in for the 2024
budget but I know for the 2023 budget um you know we were not forecasting declining real estate revenues because
we had not yet seen we were forecasting about flat real estate revenues because we had not yet seen evidence of the
impact of the common level ratio case that would let us give us a sense as to what the annual impact would be and at
that time we did um more or less show the type of rebound I'm generalizing but
that the controller is talking about right we we putting less into the reserve fund in 23 and 24 and then it
would it would rebound um what has changed in subsequent years is we have taken that conservative position in
budgeting for declining real estate taxes yes we do see the trend continue
to us that is evidence further evidence of the urgent need to resolve the
question of real estate taxes in Alageney County and the common level ratio case if we were not having to
forecast declining real estate taxes over those out years I think we would
have a very different picture as it relates to the reserve balance in those later years of the projection
okay um Okay well this has all been in I mean it's a
lot it's a lot of information and I you know I I should know more about it than
I do so I appreciate you all i'm thrilled to be here anytime you want to talk about it um uh so I do want to just
one thing is because there's so so this is just and I you know because of the the season that we're in and and
um you know I've heard the term act 47 thrown around a lot right just various
folks I've heard it on the radio and this kind you know so
um just so so it's clear so the criteria for like the the you know going into act
47 this like financial distress program include expenditures exceeding revenues
for three years not making payroll for 30 days
failing to remit employee tax withholdings things defaulting on debt payments or
failing to make uh pension payments have any of these things
happened well expenditures are expected to outpace revenue for the next five years so I mean that is true i'm not
saying I and I have reiterated that I do not believe we're on the brink of act 47 like okay but but that first factor is
going to happen for the next five years which is why I again my perspective has been the entire time that we need to
have an honest conversation with city residents and let them know where things are headed and that you know if you're out and someone's complaining that their
alley hasn't gotten paved it's probably not going to get paved next year like it just isn't I mean the cost of petroleum
is going to continue to increase right asshole's going to be more expensive because of it so from my perspective I
think the most important time to have that conversation with people is before you hit that point so but we
expenditures are outpacing revenue and they are going to for the next for the budget that you all voted on says that
fiveyear plan okay you want to respond i think your question was have any of
those things happened the answer is no um are they are they are any of them
expected to happen this year i would say the answer is also no
um the uh whether they happen whether we expenses
exceed revenues um in future years will
depend on a number of variables right the the forecast and the five-year plan are
projections not actual appropriated spending right and nor are they year-end actual results right um you know so um I
don't I don't believe that we are in a position that would make that condition
unavoidable right we're not we we can address with from where we sit today
there's no reason why that scenario has to come to pass within our existing
ability to manage for these variables and depending on some outside factors
right that we can't control and this thus can't put into the forecast i mean
I mean so okay so you so Councilman Wilson asked "Do you feel that there's anything we should do now?" So we're
about halfway through the year that we should do now again this year next year well I'm I'm
not comment I'm not prepared to say anything about next year yet right because we haven't proposed a budget for next year yet will certainly there there
are many things that by the time we propose a budget for 2026 will be very different than they were um you know in
the fall of 2024 when we proposed the current 5-year plan chief among them the
tariffs and the uh economic volatility that has followed the inauguration of
the Trump administration that we'll have to take into account i do not believe that there's anything warranting a
reopening of the 2025 budget to make adjustments at this time for reasons I already stated that the um we're we're
well within the kind of brackets of our ability to manage the um expenditure
issues that you know that we face right now and is there any type of I mean I
know you don't but you know I I don't know because I always say this right like we're council we look at
the budget and then it comes and we approve it but it's always like well what do you want to cut do you know what I mean like what what would have to go
and I I mean I just I just know over the past couple of years like there have
been a few things at least that off the top of my head like we have not introduced any new capital projects for
example right to try and just sort of not be adding new things and actually just you know finishing and doing the
things that we've already budgeted some for and getting those done is there anything else that you're looking
at for next year sort of with the same Yeah eye to
to to being frugal and and trying to conserve again I I the the the budget
process has a timeline is on the timeline that it's on for a reason right
it's it's still too early I think to give you a a clear uh articulate answer to that
question because there's still a lot we have to observe before making those um
recommendations and ultimately making that proposal but I do think that if the
cost of building materials continues to increase as it has been consistently
increasing the cost of construction has been consistently increasing since the pandemic first because of supply chain
disruptions then because of uh inflation and now because of inflation and tariffs
right so we will particularly in the capital budget um continue to face constraints and challenges and we do now
have projects that continue to be delayed because between when the their budgets are set and when bids are
received costs have gone up and we have to adjust right so that will continue to be a pain point and something that we
have to to address um in the coming years on the operating side of things I
I um you know we have every year identifi
you produced savings sometimes significant savings um in ma smart
management of our insurance costs uh our our um uh short-term disability costs
right to produce savings and we that we can continue to one that help us in the current year hit the mark and two that
over the long term we can factor into how we allocate or how we propose
funding but be able to offer a much clearer picture of this answer in
September when we produce the preliminary budget proposal okay all right yeah and I mean I guess just
generally I mean I know that this is something we're all aware of it's just you know what are the ways that we can
increase revenue without putting the squeeze on workingclass Pittsburgers you know what I mean folks who are
struggling just to you know buy groceries right um and I know that there
are then there's there are a number of things we aren't able to do which is very frustrating as a city right it
would be lovely if we could charge people who come into the city you know use the tunnel to come
into the city to go to work every day right i mean that just feels like something we should be able to do as a
city my understanding is that we're not allowed to do that from the I don't I'm not an expert in I
think it's state law and then PEDOT is the only entity that can toll an interstate right um I just wanted to
flag one thing i was I I had mentioned in an earlier point that the GFOA number for the fund balance is 10 the GFOA
number is 16.7 so we would hit that recommended threshold in 2028 not in 2029 um the
city code mandates 10% so when we're looking okay when you're looking at the fund
balance the current projections have us have us passing
um what the GFOA says is healthy in you know three
three and a half years when you say passing you mean going below yeah sorry excuse me dipping dipping below that
threshold the 16.7 threshold percent threshold in 2028 which is in three years got it but has us above or at what
is mandated man yeah there are no teeth in that yeah right so there are no teeth in it but the 10% is we'd hit at the end
of 2029 um but the 16.7% would happen at some point in 2028 got it
for further context on the fund balance in in 2020 before the before the city um
began spending out of it because of huge drop offs in revenue due to the pandemic
before that the fund balance was at $und00 million it's twice that today
right so once the um immediate impacts of uh
COVID on revenue were sort of rebounded from which in part ARPA played a large
role in we have consistently utilized that opportunity
to build up the fund balance for precisely these reasons right to to have
uh as much cushion as possible for for challenging times so before anybody knew
COVID was going to happen and that there would be either a drop in revenue or ARPA um the balance was $und00 million
and going up modestly every year but it was it was climbing but it was half of what it is today we've been able to I
see what dip into it rebound to where it was and then double it got it since 2020
okay so before COVID like our savings was you know like what what we had in the savings account generally every year
was around like a hundred million that's what it was at that point it was have been going up every year to that point
and what about before that do we know i mean the fund balance bottomed out in 2020 or 20 excuse me 2004 I think at
like $3 million okay it was and so like in like 2018 do we I mean if you don't
have it doesn't matter here i have it somewhere
it was at 133 million in 2019 um we spent about 50 of that in 2020 and then
continued to rebound after the pandemic okay so oh I see is this here's
is that is that gap unassigned
so okay so so so this oh I mean this seems like fairly sign so in 2019 we had
133 million in 2018 we had 114 this is in like in our savings account right we
had 114 million in 2017 Oh I'm going backwards apologies sorry 2020 we had 85
million that was COVID presumably where we had to That was like major rainy day like big time rainy day then 2021 we had
109 2022 up to 167 2023 up to 198 so we've been saving
money actually yes so we've been really putting money in the savings account
over the past few years oh I didn't even realize that and so then now in 2024
we're at 199 which is significantly [Music]
higher than we've ever been i mean of course things are more expensive and the dollar you know I mean I get that too
and in revenue we were um transferring from American Rescue
Plan into the general fund as well that helped yeah right but that helped us
still put money into the savings like we we got a ARPA money which helped us do stuff and then in in instead of just
being like great we've got ARPA money and this money let's just spend it all
we said wreck we got this ARP of money let's put let's let's the portion of the
ARPA funds that went to support the operating budget it was labeled um uh
well I'm forgetting the exact label but a portion of it was basically to avoid layoffs right that was the line in the
layoffs that the Paduto administration had projected they would need to enact they would need to move forward with
right in uh July of 2021 if ARPA was not passed arpa was
then passed and so the cost right to not lay those people off was part of the um
operating budget every year 21 22 23 24 and so that relieved pressure on the
fund balance and general revenue which allowed us to rebuild and in fact
grow the savings account the savings account so yes I mean that's you know I
I think that's I mean again I recognize the concern going forward but I think that that is worth noting in terms of
things that have been done over the past few years to make sure that we're financially well if you look at page 186
in that book you can see the number of FTEEs have increased by more than 200 full-time positions in the city in the
last two years so that's I mean we're at that cross point where
right you're going to like and those are positions created not necess not necessarily hired um but that is a
dramatic increase in that amount of time so while we're socking money away we will quick quickly and rapidly burn burn
through that money if we're not careful many of those positions are not general
fund positions the places we've we've increased the FTEs the most are in planning and PLI where they're paid for
out of fee revenue so Oh okay
okay all right well um I think Yeah again I mean right
increasing revenue i mean obviously it would be great there just there's so many things that I wish we could do i wish we could charge people coming in
the tunnel i wish we could do a sugary drinks tax i wish that we could you know I mean all these things that other
cities do right like to to increase revenue um you know um I wish that our nonprofit
partners would you know help in as well with these with these things
um you know because they you know if if they were forprofit specifically UPMC I don't know what the numbers like they'd
be 32 million or so a year in taxes that they don't pay because they're a nonprofit so I know that's that's a
source that's a sore point for for folks across the city um and obviously
something we need to look at going forward but uh anyway I appreciate this um I appreciate everyone coming and
having the long discussion um you know my take is my my takeaway is that you
know these are definitely concerns right but it also feels like these are concerns that you
know we have recognized for a while now and that you know have and we're working
towards them but I think that I'm hoping we can all continue to work together you know finance chair yourself director oh
she director gula OM you know continuing to work together going forward yeah
thanks thank you we'll move on to Uh Councilman Wilson I know he has a few things to say before he has to depart
and then I'll I'll make some remarks at the end so I hope people will will stay for that thank you Chair i have to uh
leave pretty soon here and I wanted to make sure that I gave some final thoughts so we have a lot of signals
that tell us that things aren't going in the right direction we have schools that are closing prt is um you know not
currently funded at a level where they could sustain the the current operations
that they have we have ARPA funding that's going away we can see the
five-year plan where we have not allocated money for the land bank we have not allocated money for um you know
all the typical things that we could you know continue to provide um the level of
service that we're at right now i believe when I look at the five-year plan
and I heard I heard um you know we're
over on overtime and in the first quarter and I heard this at the the
budget meeting which was one of our plans is to
um get more revenue with the um with the
uh not the cost level the reassessment in my understanding and I just heard
that again here my understanding is that that will not provide that much more revenue so that as a growth plan in
terms of increasing revenue doesn't sound like that is a real plan and I I
spoke to the county about this and they're not un their understanding is that that wouldn't increase um revenue
in at a level that would get us out of this hole does
anyone that controller do you have any thoughts on the
I'll let Nimita is the most familiar with this as our office solicitor yes so I think what you're referring to is the
windfall provision that the county has which says that if there is a reassessment then the county tax rate
has to adjust down to avoid the county receiving a windfall i can't remember the exact percentage right now but it's
quite small um above a certain amount in tax revenue that's right um the city
would continue to benefit from the elimination of the common level ratio being at what it is now below 60% it
allows us to continue to collect revenue and more importantly it allows us to continue to collect real estate revenue moving forward instead of real estate
revenue stagnating the hope is that this is not a one-time reassessment but that
we all get ourselves on a plan to reassess regularly frequently and honestly uh in a way that to Control
Heiser's point continues to protect our most vulnerable residents who have been in housing for a long period of time but
I do want to specify that the county windfall provision impacts the county directly but it doesn't prevent the city
from uh receiving revenue from real estate on a regular basis and the elimination of this sub60 common level
ratio would be a big help we wouldn't see an immediate spring back it wouldn't be that everybody's houses are suddenly
100% of their sale value and we're getting the total amount of money right like that's not realistic but we
wouldn't continue to see this so my point So my point is that my point is that to rely on so it doesn't sound like
we're going to get this is a long this is a hot topic for a long time uh it's been taking Yeah anyway it's it's seeing
a lot of different turns here my point is we are relying like what I'm hearing
from the administration is that the the growth pattern is is to rely on another
government entity to do something and I think that we need to have a real
economic plan i hear that a real economic plan and a job plan i'm not
seeing that at all what I'm seeing is hey look the permits look like this in
the year 2024 we must be good you know that was a good year we don't know where the next permits are going to come from
that is what or the next build the next um development is going to come from we Okay yeah loosely we do they they put a
permit in but we don't have any sort of plan to point to and say this is our economic development plan we're relying
on um from my understanding you know different you know non different
entities like the Alagany conference to devise a plan like that and loosely put
together some uh you know some revenue to to spur development downtown that we
don't even have all that revenue you know the $600 million that's that's that's there's a lot that has to come
together to make that happen and so I'm not seeing the level of commitment uh from the city side to really fix this
this um decline and I would like to understand more from the administration
on what the real growth plan i know that you've been you know quoted in the paper saying that you don't even call back
developers um like you kind of take pride in that so I mean that's concerning to me you know you said that
they had a really good time in the past administrations and I don't know if that's really a good direction for us to
go to go down um and when at this table I just hear you know the administration say that between the common level ratio
and what another government entity will do and the reassessment that that somehow is going to solve our problems
i feel like that's a real concern whenever we hear you know the controller say that you're we have to be honest
with the public about look we can't pave those streets you know in coming years and I think that's where we're at we're
just not being honest with the public we're not speaking honestly publicly about this uh and I would love to get to
a place where we're going to be um in a better financial situation because we
had these honest conversations sure so first of all I I Please keep your answers short we need to wrap up before
four and I need to say a few words before that so I actually don't have to say anything okay thank you no just keep
your answer short please and then we'll wrap up so first of all I did not say that a reassessment would be a source of
tax revenue growth i said that the reason that and for exactly the reasons Namita said um that we the annual
formula by which the common level ratio goes down is the source of us needing to project reduced revenue every year a
reassessment would change that would reset the formula and would stop the
downward pressure on revenue which is entirely artificial and produced by the ruling so I'm not claiming that not
claiming that would be a property tax revenue windfall or increasing taxes um
as a result of reassessment that is the solution only that the now courtmandated
cut to real estate revenue every year would go away for the reasons that that Namita specified um as relates to other
sources of revenue again I there simply isn't evidence other than rhetoric and
conjecture to suggest that we are seeing losses or or a downward trajectory in
investment wages um or uh building activity right so the the um all the
economic indicators including now two years of population growth don't support that claim
thank you all right so um I want to thank everyone for your participation i
this is it's clear to me that um this is daylighting a lot of what our joint
financial task force has discussed and that I take for granted because I'm a part of that but other council members
don't necessarily so um you know really important um conversation the ACER is
one thing it opened up a whole bigger conversation about many many other topics and my hope going forward is that
as we discuss um really anything that we're looking at it through the lens of
revenue growth and um expenditure m maintenance or
um you know consideration because when I you know my my observations um more so
since I've become the chair of the finance and law committee is that council although we seek to grow
revenues we don't have direct control over revenues right we can set the table we can um we can help set the table set
the foundation for an environment that grows jobs um and that helps to start new people grow new businesses or start
new businesses to grow our population to keep people from leaving the city um
investing in vacant land to get you know more properties back on the tax roles um
uh you know but we're not we're not part of we're not part of um you know a
conversation directly with the nonprofits to get our bigger share we we do have limited capacity to implement
new taxes and with expenditures the challenge is we do have control we pass
a budget every year but the process doesn't always lend itself to
um taking the deep dive that we really need to where we need to throughout the year right um we we look at it we
scrutinize it we do the best we can to digest a lot of information over a short amount of time and have conversations
throughout the year but the conversations throughout the year are peacemeal contracts coming to us without an understanding of how they fit into a
greater hole so I I'm I'm really looking forward to holding more of these types of hearings not just on ACRA and not
just as it relates to the controllers's office but looking forward to um the quarter quarterly report um the results
of and sort of the answers to the questions that many of us have raised and then you know perhaps having a non-n
November December um almost budget hearing on um as we dig into various
various departments and and getting questions answered from the department heads themselves um not just a budgeting
issue but a management issue right and and if we have questions for them getting answers directly from them about
um how they are viewing their management role through the lens of um saving this the city money or growing our revenue
sources too because I think it has to be for the next two years until we retire some of our big debt until you know a
reassessment happens a lot out of our control until you know tariffs stabilize or whatever might happen there we have
to take I think we have to we all it has to be everyone's job not just OM not that just the controllers's office not
just finance um it has to be all of our jobs to to view the decisions we make
through the lens of financial and fiscal responsibility so that's what I aim to do here I'm so grateful to everyone um
for their participation I'm really grateful to the council members who are here for for their great questions and
helping to daylight again the conversations we've had um you know at the financial task force and at um
uh even some of the you know council and and mayor's office uh leadership meetings as well so thank you there's
more to come and with that having exhausted the business of this post agenda hearing this meeting is adjourned
thank you [Music]
[Music]

[Applause] [Music]
all right Good evening and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's Cablecast public hearing for Thursday May 15 2025
Will the clerk please read the t the subject of the bill this public hearing is relative to
public safety and crime in the city of Pittsburgh Thank you And for the record we're joined by
council member Barb Warick and Councilman Anthony Kogo who's also the
chair of public safety And um just to briefly just to say I've been received a
lot of requests for um a hearing a meeting something to express the frustration A lot of residents some of
you were here today um for the crime that's occurring in the city of Pittsburgh Different issues different
reasons And so this is that meeting and we're hoping that we can come up with some maybe possible solutions But I do
want to say that um well I'll talk about the rest of this after I'm going to call the first registered speaker is Sarah
Williams No
no no You You go She's not ready to go You're not ready to go No I'm ready I'm
ready I just If you want to take a second we can call the next person There's another registered
I just was surprised I was first Yeah because I signed up late I thought
registered speaker It's kind of hard to speak on this just because I don't even know what the meeting is actually officially about So I'm I mean I get
that it's public safety and I get that there's a lot of concern and issues around that but like we don't really have an agenda here We don't have any
specific talking points to talk to So I'm just going to say a few things about where I live Um I'm in Sheridan I live
two blocks away from Langley I'm on the corner of Zephr and Hammond I'm the house that has all the plants that
everyone thinks are weeds but are actually native plants in a pollinator garden Thank you Um it's a very
important thing and one of the things that's important about it is the kids really like it I spend a lot of time
talking to my neighbors because I'm out in that garden almost every day Kids stop on their way to school Kids stop on
their way from school Kids sit on our wall Kids don't mess with my plants because I've asked them nicely not to
and they listen to me And I appreciate that Um and those kids are I know a lot of
the problem that everyone perceives about our neighborhood and they are not here to talk about what they need and
what they want and what's missing in our neighborhood So I think that is a very
very important thing that we need to be doing as we talk about all of this and that's engaging the young people in our
neighborhood and I don't mean the ones that show up to an event because they're signed up for a group I mean the ones
that are wandering around that are living across the street from me that don't have enough money to scrape
together for bus fair to get themselves to someplace that are facing food insecurity that are facing housing
insecurity and that causes petty crime We have no jobs in our neighborhood We
have no programs that provide activities that will allow kids to get paid for their time in any way shape or form And
until we start engaging with these young people and again I mean the ones that are on the edges until we actively
engage with them and it's not a bunch of us talking it's them talking with us and we are learning from them what they want
or need nothing nothing nothing is going to change There are programs in this
city that are successful and none of them are happening in the West End except for a very very few and they are
maxed out and underfunded So until we start seeing funding until we start seeing successful programs transferred
over to the West End from other parts of the city and until we start engaging with those kids petty crime is going to
keep being a thing And that's all I really have to say at the moment until we learn more about what's going on here
Thank you The next register speaker is Carl Sudter
Yes my name is Carl Sudter longtime resident of uh district 2 I
guess I'm talking about public safety is that lady is
uh public safety also concerns housing I have an address at 2781 Glenmar Street
It's right up the street from where that lady lives It's zoned in R2 area It was
illegally converted into three units with no egress from the second floor It's owned by a gentleman called Equity
Trust Company was bought in 2021 for
$75,850 Equity trust is run by a Nicholas McFalls and he lives at
23 or 233 Carrington Avenue in the north side Uh I looked uh 233 Carrington
Street in the north side He paid $411,000 for this property in
2022 As of today the property is excess for
$46,000 Uh that's what happens to Sheran The residents weren't paying attention
and they let the slum landlords take over their community So until they all
wake up and smell the roses it's going to keep getting bad So thanks Teresa for
having me Thank you Carl Now that's the exhaust our list of registered speakers Is there anyone else that wishes to
address city council tonight aaron did you want to Yes Come just come forward
Wow it's been a while I don't Is this on i don't think I don't think any of I don't think it's on
Okay Okay because I'm like I don't hear it Okay Um hi I'm Aaron Mulcheney Uh I'm
a resident of Bertha Street in Mount Washington and several of our neighbors are here from Mount Washington today Um
we have a lot of concerns about the speedway um that has become our
neighborhood Um any given night if the weather is over 60 degrees to 65 degrees
um we have an ongoing stream of racing motorcycles and later at night um cars
with modified exhaust that race up and down Bertha Street Ulysi Street um
basically the the streets that do not have the speed humps and the and the traffic calming measures That's street
That's street Um and it's it's really become an issue for a lot of the
residents when it comes to quality of life I know we talk a lot about retaining young people and bringing young families into the city and you
know we can't even get activity or action on enforcing a noise ordinance
from 1000 p.m until 6:00 a.m Um so it's been an ongoing struggle Um we've worked
with the council woman on this We've reached out to Commander Abraham I know we've been texting videos All of us have
Ring doorbells All of us have cameras that face the street Um we've sent
videos of the speed racing We've sent you know photos of who's doing it Uh we
send them in and it feels like nothing happens We've requested a camera The camera was put at the corner of Bertha
Street and Graan View Avenue We're not totally convinced the camera is being viewed Uh whatever footage is coming off
the camera Um we've requested traffic calming measures Um we've called 911
repeatedly Uh over the last I'd say two years now we've been working on this Um
one of our uh neighbors who couldn't be here this evening actually um did send
me the number of days 92 In 92 days um
there were 81 calls made to law enforcement requesting that someone come
and deal with the noise complaints and the and control what was happening on Grand View Um and there were 25
responses to those complaints Now I understand that there's
a lot going on in a city and we completely you know we're respectful of
that Um we know we're not the only neighborhood There's got to be a really creative solution here that we're not
thinking of I don't know that we need law enforcement to sit at the top of our street every night when it's 60 degrees
for seven hours but you know we'd love to work with the city and with the
police to come up with a solution Um because it's driving people out of our
neighborhood Um it's impacting our business community when we're business owners over here too Um am I cut off
okay Well happy to tell you more later Thank you And I will say Aaron was our
state representative for for you know a term So thank you Um anyone else wishing
to address Mrs Bailey
read the texture
Yeah Do you want to speak yeah
Did you want to speak yeah
Good evening everybody Even Miss Bailey I appreciate you all
coming to hear the community's concerns As this lady was saying and Carl was
saying I live in Sheridan When I purchased my property 19 years ago we
had a working police station We had plenty of police patrolling the area
Since that time it's like Mayberry RFD but we're not Mayberry RFD I've never
heard of a metropolitan city with a police station that closes That's ridiculous But that's not what I'm up
here for I'm up here about quality of life issues The city is not using
ordinance 670 as it should be used I get people sending me
pictures of garbage Not a little trash but
garbage that is pathetic We're It's like we're a third world country And not only
that we have companies that I sent the video to city council a couple of years
ago There's a company up on Route 60 They're
uh I bet I'll say the name of the company but they dump their debris in
Sheridan So I reached out to Joel Anger the man who manages the Jewish cemetery
in Sheridan because it I found it offensive These are these people's final resting place and we have companies
bringing their debris in dumping it and my fear is with all the hillsides landslides we
have on the hillsides that the cemetery is going to be destroyed by the debris that's going to
roll down the hill And I tracked this man down followed him with my cell phone
and took pictures and I submitted those pictures because somebody needs to do something But on top of that I have a
blog in Sheridan called Sheridan Community News and people submit pictures of trash that
they're forced to live by every day What can be what can be done with it right
now disruptive properties is only going after bars and commercial properties There's no commercial
businesses really in Sheridan It is the homes And as this woman said the
children need help but in order to help the kids you need to help the whole household you know because it comes crap
runs downhill You got to fix mom and dad so they can get junior together But the
issue that I'm here about really is the trash So I appreciate if you all could
enforce 670 and we can get the trash picked up find people do something Thank
you Thank you Miss Bailey Is there anyone else wishing to speak
apologize ahead of time Oh no Okay My name is Mara James and I'm a
homeowner on Stafford Street I bought the house a year ago in
July And what I've seen on this street was there's a house at 2940 who has a big hole in it that's in
court now So now two days ago my neighbors we both noticed that the hole
is spreading in the middle of the street Like the the cement on it is dipping now
is like halfway in the middle of the street Okay that's first problem Rit way
that's behind Stafford where she's talking about all the trash is that I
have three houses back there that just refuse to pick up their trash They'll
throw the bag the cars running it over and they just the Monday when it's
garbage day they just throw more trash out there It's It's pathetic And I'm
like I paid too much money for this house I got faith in Sheridan Something got to be done And and speeding from a
keys rocks is ridiculous The other night I'm in the house I'm like what is that i
can hear it coming up Stafford When they got past my house I could barely see the car That's how fast it was going This is
every single night And there's no playground for the kids to play at So
they play in the middle of the street somebody's child is going to get killed and I done called so many times to get
help on maybe get speed bumps in you know on Stafford You can sit in my house
and just listen to the Zoom real quick and there's babies out there because there's no playground for them to play
at And I told my neighbor I said "Please keep your put them in the back." But she don't want to put them in the back because there's so much trash back there
It's it's it's terrible I'll go out there with my broom and stuff and I'm not going on nobody's property but I'll
clean the street but I can't go on her property It's It's a mess It's a total mess Like with the whole the speeding
and the trash somebody is really going to get hurt I can see it coming And by me being a nurse they're going to come
knock on my door but still I mean I'm going to always help them but I'm like something has to be done quick I mean
the kids they don't have nothing to do but hang around and
just do bad stuff Like there's nothing for them to do There's no park And I'm like what what are you to
do there's no park in Sheridan for these kids
Wait wait wait wait We'll address that after We don't interrupt when there are speakers We let them speak and then
council responds Okay So I'm sorry Okay But let your child go to Sheridan
Park with one way in and one way out and all the bad kids go down there I wouldn't let my grandkids go down
there cuz it's dangerous It's secluded It's a secluded park I mean there has to be I even we
wrote letters I had a little small community meeting at my house to see if I could help these kids We wanted to
talk to Langley and see if they could have like extended something to let these kids come in there and play help
with homework I'll even get on there and help them But they turned us away And
I'm like come on These kids are the neighborhood Help them Don't let them
keep provoking to be bad because there's nothing for them to do Help these babies But they turned away Oh time up Okay So
I don't know what else to do Thanks Lori Anyone else wishing to speak
anyone else anybody from Westwood you know how to speak no Okay Anyone else okay Oh you
would do Okay I thought you did
Thank you Um I'm here as a resident and a business owner So we live my husband
and I live and work in Mount Washington And um we've been here for 25 years And
honestly the first 20 years our street was more serene than if
you were in the country Like for real it was so serene And now the noise
level in the evenings that usually start at at dark So whenever darkness comes
into play the noise level is so disturbing that the windows in my house
actually shake from the level of noise Um I have
been uh remiss in that I haven't dialed 911
because I'm not trying to be an ugly neighbor Um but I do know that 911 is
being dispatched and the only time we have called 911 is when somebody is
actually on our property Um but I'm here tonight to be part of the educational
process to learn what we as residents and business owners can do to
participate in creating a better quality of life um for businesses and for
residents to keep Mount Washington a beautiful place Grand View Avenue is a
park I don't know if we can stretch into that idea
uh for methods and ways to address noise
um potential I haven't actually witnessed a drug deal happening but
there's noise on the street that people are seeing activity that
resembles drug transactions So um that brings fear to me as a resident It
brings I don't have children but I don't even want to walk my dogs now after dark
So daytime walks is is what we have available to us because it's it's now a
scarier place to be especially as a girl walking out alone at night So I thank
you for your time and am willing to help participate as I can to be part of the solution Thank you Thank you
Is there anyone else before I You want to speak
and then you go Tony
Hello everybody My name is Tony Moreno I was invited up here to speak for some folks that are unhappy with what's going
on The basic thing that I hear that I'm being told I'm being asked to address
First I have firsthand witnessed a lot of these meetings citywide I I get asked
to come to them all the time and I try to get to them as many as possible but I've been up here three or four times
and we hear the same thing over and over and over
again You are the organization of people that represent everybody out here You
are our representatives You are our champions You are the ones that we picked to go out and fight for us stand
in the gap for us I'm just a I'm just a community member right now That's all I am I'm a retired police officer and
community member We pick you to stand in the gap for us To put yourself in
jeopardy for us To put your vote for us and not for you Stand in the gap and
fight what's going on in policy Folks you keep asking the same question and you're wondering what they're going to
do about it They're not going to tell you that this is policy from the mayor's office and they have to cooperate with
the mayor's office in order to get the things that you finally get Not that you deserve but that you finally
get These things can change right now These are not laws These are not laws that are enacted that you have to go
through your state representative to go through the house and get all the things that you need to change laws These are
policies These are this organization of nine three of which are here They get
together and they decide their policies and then they vote them and then they enact them Are they for the mayor's
office are they for council or are they for us here because right now I'm part
of us I'm just a person But I know what's going on I watch I study And this
is about changing policy and for our elected officials to stand in the gap and stop letting us get our butts kicked
out here in the street but for you to get your butt kicked on Grant Street for
us We will champion you I'm telling you right now Democrat or Republican we will
throw you on our shoulders and carry you around and say thank you for at least fighting these people They might tell us
to go get bent and they're stealing our money anyways but at least we can come here and not beg you for help but say
thank you for helping us And what more can we do i'm just asking for the people that call me to be here Champion for
us please Thank you Nance did you want to speak
um I'm Nancy Burns I just want to let the Mount Washington people know I grew up in Mount Washington I am an old Mount
Washington person I started the girls softball league up there when I was 16 I
want to let you know that those motorcycles and stuff have been going on for over 30
years Okay so it's not nothing new but I hope you get it resolved because it has
been a very long time going on The other thing I live in Sheridan
and there is crime There are kids walking around Uh we had three boys
about a month ago that walked around the neighborhood They didn't make it obvious that they were up to no good you know
wearing a ski mask and the hoodie over their eyes I didn't make it obvious you know but I came out on my porch and
watched them and they were looking in cars and I said you know do you see what
I asked my son do you see what they're doing and they turned and looked at me They walked up the street and turned around and yes I took a picture of them
I also informed neighbors from different streets because they were heading down towards um the park the park down there
So neighbors confronted them also No one's car was broken into that day Neighbors need to stand up because
we You can't let them know you're afraid I worked for the board of ed for 44 years You can't let the kids win You can
help them I had kids that were throwing rocks on my trampoline and I invited them in my yard and we had a fire We had
a fire pit They didn't know what a s'more was Had a s'more Never saw them again after that Never yelled at the
kids nothing But I tried to get them to see that it's it's not bad you know
Um but we need to work as a community too We can't just you know put everything
on council And I mean we need to block the block parties back the groups the
families the whatever And I mean I'm still a M Washington fan I'm sorry I
grew up here you know Um but that was That's all I wanted to say You know we we need to
get the the community together and do phone calls like I did and stop the cars
from somebody's car from being stolen that day Thanks N Is there anyone else
wishing to speak anyone else wishing to speak before city council i do want to
acknowledge that we also have Beth Pittinger the executive director of the Citizens Police Review Board with us tonight too Okay with that said I'm
going to turn it over to my colleagues and uh start with Councilman Khill who's
the chair of public safety Thank you Thank you Councilwoman Uh thank you all
for coming out this evening It's beautiful evening I'm sure there's a lot of other things you could have been doing Um as uh Teresa said I'm the
chairman of public safety So I've been following closely just so you know the numbers on the police department I
follow I've post agendas on it We keep a close eye on it And I don't want to scare anybody but we're at an all-time
low for Pittsburgh police officers We've never had less police officers patrolling our street than we do right
now Ever Right We're under 750 Right size is probably more like 950
Okay When uh Mr Moreno was on the force which thank you Tony for your service He was a good cop from all You're welcome
And uh so you know he had probably a,000 maybe 1,200 when he was working So so
we're at an all-time low and it's not just this administration's fault it's administrations beforehand Um you know
we haven't had recruitment classes to to stay with the losing we lose certain
amount by retirement but we're really plagued now by other municipalities like
Monroville My cousin's a police chief of Monroville My brother is a police chief of Cantonsburg There is not a year that
goes goes by where they don't talk to me Thanksgiving or Christmas whether it be
um that they basically cherrypick our our police officers right we get a new
police officers on the force for four or five years we're paying them I'm just rounding about at different levels but
say we're paying them $60,000 Well Candensburg will call and offer them $90,000 because it's it's it's
nationwide It really is It's hard to find people who want to be police officers today So I just want to start
by saying that okay well we're at a situation we're trying to do many things to um recruit and retain the officers
that we have but it's not going to be something that's going to be solved overnight So we're going to have a shortage for some time Um I'm here
speaking as a public safety chairman and as Teresa's colleague but I also am here
as a not as a resident of of District 2 but uh I'm no stranger to District 2 I
kind of grew up in Olympia Field I grew up in Beachview but you know we spent JFK football as a kid and and I know
Mount Washington like the back of my hand In fact my better half Lisa his neighbors with Kathy and Darren and
Kathy spoke up here owner of Grand View Bakery and they we live right next to each other So uh I see firsthand your
problems and Lisa complains about it all the time So I am here kind of speaking for a constituent my constituent of
district 2 Um something I agree Erin Kathy something needs to be done Uh you
know just last night Kathy I come home I'm taking Lisa home late It's always late when I'm bringing her home Uh you
know kids and what they do is they park outside our houses and they just like party there I don't know It's just like
a place for them to hang out Meanwhile we're trying to sleep and they're loud They're boisterous They throw their
stuff on the ground Um besides Bertha Erin I know I see it You know um we
really have to have police patrolled I didn't realize it's Abraham the commander I thought maybe that was Ripple So Abraham's the commander for up
there Okay So uh I couldn't agree more I will follow her lead I will tell you anything she wants me to do as far as
intervening and you know uh again speaking out just is kind of a resident
de facto Uh I see it all the time I understand it And and not only that you
go up Grand View Avenue if like you said one of you said when it's a nice evening out oh my gosh you can't even drive down
there They're just in the middle of the street They're everywhere So I don't know exactly what the answer is there but more police presence certainly would
be uh you know good start And somebody ticketing on Bertha Car I'll get to you man Let me let me go through everything
All right Well the boss here says you know she'll she'll let us know Um so so so anyway I understand the problem up
there Sheridan Um again I spent a lot of time at Sheridan Uh who was it sarah was
speaking to the kids have nothing to do You know Sheridan when I was growing up had one of the greatest sports
organizations around I don't know if they still do or not
Yeah I know But I'm saying they do not have a good sports They don't have a little Don't engage Don't do that Okay
Okay So anyway that's what kept that's what kept me my brothers out of trouble
growing up right it was the athletic organizations and things they do Um uh Carl what you spoke to as far as
the housing goes let me tell you we're seeing this all over the city I see it in Brooklyn I see it in Beach View You know we have a problem with like LLC's
that are some some of these people we don't even know where they're at When we when they're when they're overgrown or their tenants are leaving trash out or
need to be cited we try to look for the owners to site them They're all over the world What we're having is these
developers or real estate collectors call it what you want but they're gobbling up properties within the city
of Pittsburgh They know it's going to be worth something someday but meanwhile they're just sitting on them and really not doing much with them So a lot of them are just deteriorating It's
frustrating for me when we can't find where the homeowner is or we've cited them numerous times and it just goes
unanswered So you know um really bad We talked about the garbage You know I've
been cleaning up my own district I can't stand it I agree with you 100% Garbage is like it's a nast It's the easiest
thing to do for us as a city is to pick up garbage It really cost us nothing Some two two people in a truck going
around Um I took it upon myself I don't know if you've seen the Liberty Tubes the entrance to the Liberty Tubes the
nasty garbage and everything that's accumulated down there It's my district
No Is that your district or is it mine well I'm cleaning I don't know I don't know It's me you or Charlotte I I didn't
actually know but my district drives by it So that was that was like uh you know I I had to clean that up It really is
really really bad Um so so I agree with a lot of what you're saying I will say you know um one of the problems is the
lack of police presence getting police uh to respond to Mount Washington say when they come speeding up and down 70
mph on Bertha Street which is ridiculous Somebody is going to be killed up there
Motorcycles as well you know So uh yeah I just need some self of some self some
control up there Some some presence police presence whatever it is Again I'll work with Teresa Whatever she wants
to do with the police up there I'm a full partner because I'm vested also up there as well And Lisa Kathy I wish I'd
have known you were going to be here She's probably going to be so proud that you were here because everything you say she agrees 100% with and is always you
know relaying to me Other than she wants Fetzer and Bertha paved but uh that's another story So Um so so anyway I'm
again I'm the public chair public uh safety chair So uh any questions regarding the police and you know lack
of them or uh how we respond or how we don't respond to things I'm here to answer any questions And um I'll turn it
back to you Thank you And if he's going to do anything I want we're going to get our bikes and ride up on Councilwoman Warick did you want to
say something yeah sure Uh yeah Thanks everybody for for for coming out I know
that it's you know it's a nice night and you know I I appreciate you all taking your your evening to come here um and
talk to us And uh this is uh this is my first time here at this this rec center So I represent district five which is on
the east side of town right squirrel Hill Greenfield Hazlewood Lincoln Place Hayes Um uh so I I do I I have to admit
I'm not real familiar with your communities over here in the layout Uh but I've you know been taking some notes
Um Yeah I mean on some of these topics uh you know the litter I I hear you
right i hear you It's it's it's an issue in Pittsburgh right like like dealing with the litter and um it's something
I'm I'm the chair of public works so that means I I talk it's something I talk about with the director of public works all the time
Um I know that it um it feels like an intractable problem
but it doesn't have to be right and um and you know there there are plans uh
hopefully for next year But you know something that I I mean my personal feeling is that when it comes to litter
that we should be treating litter our DPW folks should treat litter the same way that we treat snow and um weeds
right is that you have a season right so so you know in the winter it's snow in
the spring and summer you know when the when stuff's overgrowing and you you know they cut back so you can make safe turns around you know that kind of thing
That's that's when you do you know that's the main thing Um and then uh you
know maybe after winter there's like pothole season right before before paving and after after the snow But I
think that in that in that like October you know September October November
season uh when the leaves are dead and you can really see right you can really see the hillsides It seems to me that
that should be like litter season My feeling is that if we can plow all the
streets in Pittsburgh uh within 24 hour like of a snow you know what I mean in a snow event then we can use that same
kind of system to go through you know take like a six week whatever period it is and go through and do like a deep
clean because it's not every street right so and do a sort of a deep clean on litter and then um and then just sort
of regular maintenance as as needed Uh that's that's sort of one idea But
another um uh sort of it's called the gold plan
like our folks in environmental environmental services are like the garbage and recycling like the
cleanup end of DPW Uh they have something uh sort of on the books called the gold plan and that basically would
be like to hire a dedicated crew that just does only litter u you know and has
like their own space So that's kind of two different ways to approach the same issue Um but we are obviously not there
yet right and um it's something that I am definitely committed to uh continuing
to push on you know in until we can get something in place right i it seems like
and I understand that it's a behavior thing too Um uh you know getting young
people not to throw trash out please tell anybody you know don't throw trash out of your car But at the same time we
should be picking it up because if there's litter then you're more likely to throw more litter right if there's litter on the ground you're more likely
So so um I I appreciate you um talking about that Um as far as the the racing car
situation um you know I I I texted our director of public safety at you know
this feels to me like um a need for patrols I mean again I'm
not I'm not from here I don't want to assume but this feels to me like the need for just regular patrols We need officers in their car regularly Doesn't
have to be all the time 247 but it has to be often enough that when
you're driving through you you don't want to risk it because you might get and and I do I can't again I can't speak
because I don't I'm not familiar with the zones over here I do know over in zone four uh we are starting a pilot
program with um our commander over in zone 4 where um they have like a
dedicated team and they sort of like they they circulate around the neighborhood So like they started it in
Greenfield and they did in Greenfield they did just like I mean if they weren't on a on a on an emergency call
they there was like this dedic I don't know it was like four or five officers and they were in Greenfield and they were taking you know they were ticket in
people if they're running stop sign you know that kind of thing um and then they moved to Oakland next right so I don't
know maybe that's something to to explore with your commanders right like
but it you know Um you know we are we are short on
police I think the the ideal was maybe 8 right 850 950 I've heard 850 but we are
below that Um you know we the the city is doing you know we've been doing recruitment classes Uh we did give the
police a raise I think it was last whatever their last contract right they did get a raise A few other things we've
been doing to to make it so that officers can spend their time on
on you know urgent violent crime as opposed to sort of not you know less
urgent is um the telephone reporting unit So mandatory telephone reporting So
instead of have so let's say your let's say your car got broken into in the middle of the night you come out
in the morning your car has been broken into right rather than having an officer drive to your house to like take that
report at your house you can call it in and that is saving some some time not
not a ton but but some right for our officers um I mean I know that before that I've seen officers I I was in a
restaurant once and I saw an officer get called because there was a dispute over the bill Like that's not what they
should be doing right that's not what we that's not they are these are highly trained officers and um so they should
be focusing on things like that right like urgent safety issues like cars speeding down the street and doing doing
that kind of enforcement That's my opinion Uh you know we also have an expanded social work bureau now of 60 or
so social workers So like if it's a mental health call that is clearly not a violent call right is clearly not does
not need someone with a gun We have a a social work team that can be called in to to handle that that situation So you
know it's it is it's it's sort of how we're kind of cobbling together while we
are low right making the most out of those of the officers that we do have right and making sure that they are out
and and and I think that I think it's fair enough for us as council people and for you as residents to you know to
expect that our officers are out on patrol in you know as much as possible
right um so um yeah thanks for for bringing
all that to to light here Uh the last thing is uh you know I I I really want
to say thank you to the two folks about the one about the garden about you know
inviting kids to enjoy your your garden and also like inviting them in to the
you know to to to the fire pit to like because I just just to talk a little bit we had a we had a post agenda I think it
was just yesterday about uh something that uh the city is doing called the safe passages program and that's
something that we're doing in seven of our high schools It's in Perry Aldderise Arlington Brashier Millions uh Milion
sorry Obama and Westinghouse So this is a program It is the city operation better block
Pittsburgh public schools uh reach right and it's sort of part of the stop the I don't if you've heard the stop the
violence initiative So these are folks in the schools they are engaging
ambassadors who so they're finding kids who are like at risk of violent incidences
um and kind of training those kids to become mediators amongst their peers and
I mean it was a really fabulous I I encourage everybody to watch the post agenda it's actually very moving and um
the I don't I don't I should I wish I brought the I don't have all the numbers
but I mean the the incences the disciplinary incidences in the school So for example in Westinghouse just in
Westinghouse went from the the year that it started they had
1,599 disciplinary incidences and the following year they had
874 This is a very successful program remarkable Um
uh also significant drops So like there there have been a 20 overall there's been a 27% this is just in like a year
and a half or so 27% drop in discipline incidences a 14% drop in the number of
students who are like involved right like these sort of high-risisk kids and a an almost 8% drop in in violent events
overall Um it's a really incredible program This
is exactly what you're talking about here right it is bringing people it is bringing adults together to you know
they even have technology like an alert system So if there is an incident in the neighborhood like o over the weekend
right and they hear about it right because you know this is community folks they get an alert and then
everyone mobilizes they're communicating between schools So if you have kids who
don't know each other between schools and there's incidences happening say on a bus or whatever between communities
It's just been a very successful program and um I I don't I don't know what what the
what's the high school for this i don't have one It's in Brerier Oh it's Brashier Language course It used to be
language That's part of the problem Okay Okay Well at any rate so you know these
programs do exist and uh and they're doing very good work and I know that it's not you know it's it's not
something that happens overnight Uh but it is it is happening and it is and it
and and there is success you know and I know that it when it comes
to sort of things like car breakins and things like that's that's sort of small
consolation right if your car is getting broken into but I think uh sort of
bigger picture it it is important to remember that you know programs like this are
leading to red major reductions in like gun violence Right like a 33% drop in homicides in the city and a 44% drop in
non-fatal shootings And these are these kids right last year in 2024 we did not
have a single kid between I think it's like 13 and 17 you know murdered by a gun We did
have two incidences this this year but they were not gun violence but they were
kids play you know like playing with guns At any rate one death is too many
But um but I just want you all to know that that this type of this issue of the
kids it is something that is this is a number one focus right now in our public
safety department at the city of Pittsburgh right whether it is our social work team our law enforcement
folks our community folks um you know and our other you know nonprofit
partners Um lots of work is being done It's not work that you necessarily see every day
but it is it is being we are taking it seriously I just want to stress that Um
I don't think and I agree with Tony I don't always agree with you Tony but I do
agree You're right This body we we have the power to make these types of it
right like we as as your representatives have the the you know we can all sit
down with our directors we can all be you know push push push push until the things get fixed and it doesn't always
happen overnight right it doesn't always happen fast and you know sometimes it feels like forever but it's it's that
you know and and you have good repres representation here and so uh anyway anyway I just want to say thank you for
having me and uh yeah glad to have you Can I add one more thing thank you Go ahead You want to answer okay Yeah I
just just wanted to comment a couple things Um first and foremost Beth Pittinger she says it best You'll hear
her say uh we are now a big city with a small town police force Did I do that
Justice small town police department for big city problem There you go Okay So so and that's kind of the state that we're
in It really is Um as far as the phone calls go Councilwoman Warwick uh opened up to you know when you go to a station
if nobody's manning our police stations anymore at night which is a scary thing Uh my district we are up in arms We
don't if somebody's rans hacking our car we expect a police officer to be there and take a report And it may be hard for
us to do because of lack of police we have but we still want that We still expect it I still expect it So and and
and we're lucky because we have a really great commander most of you do for this area in Ripple Uh Commander Ripple and
he's also commander for parts of my neighborhoods and he's he's just the best Um the other thing was our best
means of of getting you know this crowds out of off of Grand View and you know
kind of just being too rowdy and causing trouble is this woman right here your council woman I know that she has
stopped many of times on her own and like kicked gangs of kids off of the corner and they scadattleled when she
comes So we all know she's retiring so maybe we can find a job for her as a steady you know enforcer She is an
enforcer trust me up there So uh don't give me a gun and a badge Okay She
doesn't need a gun and a badge That's the beauty about it Okay Thanks That's it for me Thanks Well I'm so embarrassed
You do You kick them off the corner I know you have I also feed the kids and buy them toys
Okay Of course A lot of people have seen the kids run to my car when they see me I'm going to say that They don't run away
from me But um but I do want to thank my colleagues for coming because they've had a busy day today all of our cable
bureau people our staff from the um community engagement office for city council and our sergeant-at-arms who is
a Sheridan resident by the way But okay I said that I hope Okay And so um I just
want to thank all of them for being here and of course our lovely Julie senior center staff Um so thank you all for for
all the work you put in so that we can have these meetings in the evenings to make it more accommodating for the residents and we did get a lot of
requests from residents and it was actually across the city and so I was hoping more people from across the city would be here so it wasn't just my
district but um I am glad that my district came out to share their concerns and some of the concerns that they have but I will say that I do I
want to talk about a few things I think part of um well first let me just say in terms
of the litter I I think I've done what I can as a council person I've picked up litter I've um wrote the anti-litter
campaign you know that whole program Uh started the grass cutting program across
the city of Pittsburgh did the e-recycling program and did all sorts of things to help with that part But I do
think a part of it is an education piece that we're missing And I think our kids I know everybody thinks I'm crazy when I
say this but I think our kids want to do what's right if people give them a chance Part of what our district struggles with is 50% of the kids in
Sheridan are in foster care So half the kids that will be there this year won't be there next year So they're in a transit situation And I think when we
talk about um doing things for the kids we absolutely have to engage the parents
And I think that that's or the or the guardian or whomever they're staying with because a lot of the problems is
that um people don't know each other and and I think communities don't know one another But in Sheridan in particular
I'm going to say I think there is a lot of programs for the kids in there There always has been and or there hasn't
always been I should say but there has been recently We have hope for tomorrow We have Sister Mary has a program We have the boxing program at Langley which
I helped start with um the late Jimmy Sevetic Um we have um Open Fields does
work all over our district and mostly in Craften Heights and um Northw Heights Um
but a lot with uh kids that need that need some direction and um Elliot West End Athletic Association does some stuff
with kids We have a library in Sheridan We have a pool and we do have a park and the park has two mill $2 million for
renovations for the park but it has not been spent yet And as much as council can advocate and as much as we can work
with directors we do not direct the directors So I don't want people to think that we can do something we can't do We do not direct directors That is a
any implementation is up to the administration side not up to council We can say here's the money Here's what we
want you to do We can write legislation but we can't make a director implement that whatever it is that we want I wish
we could sometimes and I try sometimes to make them do it anyway because I do know that we need a lot in our area But
we also have the Steven School building which we're working on That's supposed to be a home for the um Hope for
Tomorrow program Sister Mary's uh resource center the boxing program and
then a community center for the entire region And that has that had $4 million
and we just took a half a half a million out to put in for a playground up in Mount Washington on Shaylor to get that
done too So there's two million this year they're supposed to use for um waterproofing that building uh for the
Stevens school building Um so once that's up and running they'll have some place more places to go and more things
But I try to tell everybody and the kids especially that an absence of something to do is not a reason to commit a crime
because I think we keep making that excuse and it makes kids hear that And I said one of the things in short tier
cities they hold the bar so high I mean they yelled at me once because I brought somebody down with me without telling permission So you know it was like they
were serious They really they hold the bar high And I think part of that is is why their community is so amazing I mean
it's an you know it's one of the safest neighborhoods in the city of Pittsburgh the only predominantly black neighborhood we have in our in our
district And it has the one of the highest home ownerships in the city of Pittsburgh because they hold the bar
high They're really high And I think I give them credit for what they've done It's they've done it not because the city's done it because they've done it
You know the residents have done it So part of that is is that they held expectations um really high for their
kids and I want us to start doing that Yes they do need something to do but there are a lot of things for them to do
and if I keep telling people if having something to do meant kids would be safe Homewood and Sheridan would be some of
the safest neighborhoods because they have some of the most things the other neighborhoods don't have I mean Esland
has they don't have any of those things They have a playground that's it Um you know Westwood has the playground
a school and a ball fields Yeah And Oakwood has a playground And so there's
there's not East Carnegi has a playground So there's a lot of things that our neighborhoods don't have We
only have four pools in our 20 out of 23 neighborhoods So most of them don't have a pool Most of them don't We only have
four libraries The one in Beach I keep remind them is in our district but uh but we only have four
libraries But you know Sheridan has the library Sheran has you know but we have to get them up and running We have to make them usable so the kids can
actually enjoy them When we did the master plan for Sheridan we had more kids attend that process than any other
place in the city I mean it was really nice I want to see them young enough to enjoy that I want to see it happen while
they're still young And I actually talked about it this week actually
Um but I think like when we talk about
um the the commander for zone 3 I think he does the best he can because he's
also balancing between um southside and that's a that's a challenge And he is
putting he did we did put the cameras up You're right we need to know about that He did put in um undercover officers but
you're right we need to know about what's happening We need we asked for a report a couple weeks ago but I'm sure he's probably swamped himself Um and we
um and he's also working actually this new chief is actually working with Commander Ripple to maybe give him back
the cycles and have him put the cycles up there for enforcement So if that happens I think that will address the
issues And I think that's what we need all across our district and all across the city I think a little bit of enforcement with a little bit of
programming and a little bit of education and a little bit of caring all balanced balancing one and us doing our
part with legislation But um and I do think that when we talk about the um
problems with properties they did take out this administration did take out the
um com the residential and just have commercial but we talked about maybe changing that back and and increasing
residential because that's what's ex Sharon's experiencing problems with residential properties and that's what
some of our other neighborhoods are So we'll we'll um move forward with that or look at you know how we can do with that
get that passed with five votes of council And the other thing is that we're also working on no cruising laws
that the commander brought to us saying that that's what he needs for enforcement um in the area So I'm
working with Bob Charlotte on that because it was his it was something he was working on initially
Um but with that said I do think that we have to make sure that we realize that a lot of times policy matters and and if
people are saying that they want to defund the police or they want to do this or they want to do how that affects you does matter and and it there is some
balance there You have to have some balance Um I don't want to see everybody arrested I don't want to see everybody
um walking away free I want to see some balance where we're enforcing laws that you know will be given somebody a chance
We're enforcing the laws and so that you don't become victims because it's not fair to the people that are trying to do
everything right in paying for it a lot of times So I I think that we need to make sure that we're doing a better job
with that And so for my part I'm willing to work on that with my colleagues and and see what we can do to improve those
areas and that stuff But um I do want to say I think with the kids when it comes to the
kids everybody knows the kids are my soft spot I could slap the fire out of an adult but when it comes to the kids I
mean actually I feel badly because so many of the kids are struggling so many ways And um but I think to get the kids
healthy we have to give the adults help So um so I think those are some things that we are still working on and and
things we're trying to work with And there are programs that we try to work through with you know Kesha Gomez as Ebony you know Lunsford every farmer EB
does a great program where she's letting kids come in and learning about farming and um I think it's those are things
that that make a difference and you know really make kids feel important So you didn't come to hear me We really just wanted to come hear you So I'll end it
with that Um is there anything else anybody else wants to add i could just say one other thing Yeah When we talk
about policy um Tony mentioned it Teresa mentioned it Uh one policy we have and
this goes back to Mount Washington and the motorcycles flying up and down Our policy in the Pittsburgh Police
Department is to not chase anybody on a motorcycle a dirt bike where any type of
motor vehicle that's not a car basically Um problem is they know that They know
it now They do And they just blatantly will jump speed whatever They know we're
not going to chase them So whether I'm not for chasing them all the time because it is dangerous It puts other
people in danger It's got to be a better way But uh but but to just come out and blanket and say we're not going to we're
not going to chase anybody on a minibike or a motorcycle or dirt bike it's uh you
know it's it's putting a lot of people at risk and and that's why we have people driving up and down Bronzeville Road They drive up and down on the
sidewalks to go around the traffic 60 m an hour right past the library Uh so you
know that's just one policy thing that needs to be changed I'm working on that with our our public safety director
Whether we chase them or not is irre well it's not irrelevant but the fact that it's known to everybody out there
on a motorcycle on a minibike that we're not going to chase them It's they're laughing at us They really are They're
just like laughing at us and saying well you won't chase me because you're not allowed It's our policy So a lot of things have to change like that That's
just one that is front and center for me that we that I thought of while we were talking So yeah I chase them But
anyway but anyway they need to when they make the laws like that they need to not
use right so I'm just going to add that um I know we need to do some things differently I have voted against the
police budget and I voted against the entire budget this year because I do know that there's some issues and I'm
not going to vote for something that's going to put our area under my council can allocate legislate and advocate
Implementation is up to the administration So I don't want to see council members blame for something that they have no authority to do I mean a
lot of people like to misrepresent what we have our authority to do We all wish we could make them all do what we want
to do because believe me there'd be a lot of things different But um with that said um we do the best we can with by
controlling the budget and control and writing legislation and getting that passed But you need five members to do anything You can't just do it yourself I
wish you know we all wish we could do things by ourselves sometimes But we do have a great team So I want to thank my colleagues and uh with that said um can
I have a motion to adjourn and we can stay and talk
oh motion to second meeting adjourned Thank you everyone Thank you Heat Heat
