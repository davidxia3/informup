to be joined for the first portion of this hearing by my colleague Council Member Sandy Nurse who chairs the
committee on criminal justice we've been joined so far this morning by council members Sanchez Lewis Carr and Moya uh
welcome to First Deputy Commissioner Francis Torres um and your team thank
you for joining us today to answer our
questions financial plan for FY26 to 29 with a
prop 26 budget of 115.1 billion doc's
proposed FY26 budget of 1.21 billion represents less than 1% of the
administration's proposed budget in the executive plan this is
$869,000 less or 0.1% from the amount originally budgeted in the preliminary
plan back in January the decrease is attributed to staffing transfers a
decrease in the heat light and power budget and motor fuel the executive plan also includes an additional baselining
for collective bargaining and the lightning law discovery sharing platform
as of March 2025 DOC had uh a little over 1500 vacancies relative to its FY25
budgeted headcount my questions today will largely focused on on DOC staffing levels the large increase in overtime
the capital budget vacancy rates agency program funding and general budget
changes but I now want to turn over to my co-chair for this hearing Council Member Nurse for her opening statement
good morning everyone thank you chair Brandon uh thank you to all the DOC
leadership who have joined us today please give our regards to the commissioner hope she's feeling well um
today I plan to focus on how the mayor's executive budget for the department of correction supports the overall plan to
close Rikers and transition to the burough bailbased jail system as well as
how holistic criminal justice reform policies provide appropriate resources to ensure proper programming is provided
and divert people away from the criminal justice system in the fiscal 2026 executive plan
DOC has a total budget of 1.21 21 billion which supports 8,85 budgeted
positions the plan includes several changes including funding for overtime adjustments virtual visitation platforms
and federal funding for opioid and substance abuse programs among among other important topics which I plan to
explore today in my line of questions the mayor's Office of Criminal Justice recently released an update to the 2019
points of agreement which is a list of commitments that must be met in order to be able to properly and safely close
Riker's Island i intend to ask about the DOC's involvement and clarify many of
the updates that are directly impacted by the policies and actions of the department i want to thank our committee

good morning Chair Nurse Chair Brandon and members of the committees on
criminal justice and finance i am Francis Torres first deputy commissioner
of the New York City Department of Correction my colleagues and I are here to discuss the department's executive
budget for fiscal year 2026 and what lies ahead for the agency in the coming
year when Lenel McGin Liiti was appointed commissioner she committed herself to
leading this agency under the guiding principles of service compassion and
respect so that both staff and people in custody have their voices uplifted and
feel safe in our jails she has made it clear to staff on all
levels that she expects the same from them and they have delivered no matter
the challenges we are facing most recently the department has
experienced an unexpected increase in the census driven in large part by the
New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision temporarily
suspending intake of state ready individuals due to the wildcat strike
today we have over 7,600 individuals in custody compared to
approximately 6,300 this time last year in contrast we
have approximately 5,900 uniform members of service to manage the jails and other
critical operations compared to over 6,200 last year
despite this dedicated staff across all divisions have risen to the call and
throughout this challenge we have ensured that all people coming into our
care have a bed and can be safely housed during this period important
violence indicators have continued to trend downward we continue to
collaborate with partners throughout the criminal justice system to ensure people in custody are moving expeditiously
through the court process and are not lingering in our custody longer than
they should our commissioner has said it before and I will say it on her behalf
this morning heroes work here at the New York City Department of Correction
we remain laser focused on recruiting and supporting staff to do this
challenging and important work in March of this year over 100 new recruits
graduated from the DOC Academy and became part of the Boldest
family and we have a new class starting at the end of this week last week we
held an exam for correction captains and hope to promote dedicated members of
service into critical frontline leadership positions where they will
support and mentor correction officers and help shape the culture of our
agency our commissioner has stated repeatedly that leadership
matters all promotional classes for supervisors have several leadership
development components built leadership focus as a foundation
for all leadership development within the agency
it's incredibly important that we foster the next generation of correctional leaders to carry the important work of
reform forward for decades to come at the beginning of this month we
celebrated National Correctional Officers and Employees Week as part of
the celebrations and in furtherance of our efforts to support our staff we
opened four additional wellness centers to promote more opportunities for them
to focus on their well-being recharge and show up as their best selves
it is imperative that we uplift and honor the dedicated public servants who
give so much of themselves to keep our city safe not just for one week but each
and every day finally before turning to the budget
we would like to highlight several exciting initiatives that are coming to fruition in the next fiscal year
we have been working diligently to meaningfully expand programs and
services in critical areas which were chosen based on a number of factors but
most importantly input from people in custody and our staff providers have
been selected and we anticipate an announcement soon with services
beginning in the coming weeks we're also looking forward to rolling out Lightning Law discovery sharing
platform lightning Law will allow the efficient and confidential sharing of
records between clients and their attorneys through electronic devices
we are hopeful that this technological innovation will support speedier case
processing and better justice outcomes which benefits
everybody we are procuring a new virtual visitation platform aimed at improving
the visit process for attorneys and those visiting their loved ones in jail
this new platform will allow attorneys to more easily schedule virtual meetings
with incarcerated clients and discuss case updates these measures will help
modernize our jails provide better access to critical services and
ultimately improve outcomes for those who are in our care
now we will briefly turn to the fisc year 2026 executive budget as of the
fisc year 2026 financial plan the department's budget is
1.3 billion the vast majority of this
87% is allocated for personal services and 13% for other than personnel
services the fiscal year 2026 executive budget
increased by 288 million compared to fiscal year
2025 adopted budget of 1.0 billion
some of the increases of the budget of the executive budget include a federal
grant funding for the Bureau of Justice Assistance Comprehensive Opioid Stimulant and
Substance Use Sitebased Program with allowances of 10,000 in fiscal year
2025 an additional 586,000 in fiscal year 2026 6 and
340,000 in fiscal year 2027 respectively this grant will help expand
substance misuse services for department's high-risk high needs
population through the addition of five substance misuse counselors
we receive an additional 1 million baseline funding beginning in fiscal
year 2026 for Lightning Law also in fiscal year 2026 we received
$1.4 million for the virtual visitation webbased platform that will
improve virtual visits the fiscal year 2025
executive capital commitment plan totals 14.6 billion which covers fiscal years
2025 through 2035 as of the fiscal year 2026
executive financial plan most of the capital funding is tied to the
borrowbased jail program which totals 13.9 billion over the 10-year plan and
is allocated as follows brooklyn facility 2.3 billion
manhattan facility 4.1 billion bronx facility 3.1 billion Queens facility
four billion we continue to work diligently
to attract and retain both civilian and uniform staff the total authorized
headcount is 8,810 which includes
7,60 uniform positions and 1,750 civilian positions our actual
uniform staffing levels remain well below our authorized headcount and the
department plans to use the new needs approved for recruitment and advertisement in the preliminary budget
to aggressively advertise and utilize marketing strategies to promote
recruitment we continue to welcome the council's support promoting job
opportunities within their networks as we look at the year ahead we
celebrate the heroes that work at the department when we think of a hero we
think of someone who is courageous and selfless someone who puts others needs
before their own that's what a hero does that's who
correction officers are they are the backbone of our collective
achievements over the past 130 years and they will continue to be a
powerful force for hope and transformation in the years to
come over the past fiscal year we have made progress in spite of many
challenges because that's what the boldest do the work we do is difficult
and yet crucial it is vital to this city
commissioner Mcini Liri our team and I and all the heroes that work alongside
us remain committed to this important work thank you for the opportunity to
testify today my colleagues and I are available to answer your questions
thank you Commissioner uh quickly we've been joined by council members Powers Norcis and Ayala uh I want to dive right
into staffing and overtime so last year uh DOC's adopted budget included uh
132.7 million for overtime at the end of the fiscal year the department's
overtime spending was approximately 281 million uh in the executive plan the
department has increased their personnel budget uh by 192 million which DOC has
stated is currently around 95% overtime funding so how much of this additional
funding has been allocated for overtime good morning Chair Brandon good morning
if you allow me I would like our assistant commissioner assigned to finance assistant commissioner Zabir to
go into the specifics sure good morning thank you for the question faison Zubar assistant commissioner of
financial operations and budget administration uh we have approximately 180 million uh
allocated towards overtime funding with the new needs that we received not new needs but uh additional overtime funding
okay and then at the end of the fiscal year your overtime spending was around
281 million is that right
that is correct okay so that's a hund00 million less than this 180 do you think you're going to blow past that
uh our expected projection by the end of the fiscal year is approximately 337 so
yes we do anticipate that
okay so wait explain that $337 million number is what uh is our anticipated
fiscal year 25 overtime expenditures and was the department's annual pattern
of actual overtime spending doubling the budgeted amount the main reason for the increase
I'm sorry can you repeat the question can you was DOC's annual pattern of actual overtime spending doubling the
budgeted amount the reason for that increase
um I'm not 100% It might be i'm not I'm not 100% sure
i'm sorry i mean is it still a priority for this administration to lower overtime spending chair if I may you're
absolutely correct every effort is being made by our department to ensure compliance with mayoral directive
2024 to explain to you what initiatives we've established within our department
to reduce the overtime i would like to introduce you to Bureau Chief Chief of Staff Rembert who will speak to our
efforts good morning thank you for the question
i am Sher Rembert uh the Bill Chief Chief of Staff New York City Department Correction as you know um sir we are
currently facing a staffing crisis uh uh the city hold of
um hiring for for years expecting a population increase but it has only grown our agency operates the entire
system not just for facilities um housing areas and or course of hospital
we rely on all personnel for operation efficiency in calendar year of 2024 634
uniform members of service are treated that's out of that is 578 correction officers 44 captains as
of April of 2025 212 correction officers
are eligible to retire however in also in 2025 up until
today,4 did retire by the end of calendar year of 25 a total of 419
additional correction officers will be eligible to retire by the end of calendar year 2026 a total of
716 additional correction officer will be eligible to retire with saying all of
that we continue to do everything possible to reduce the overtime by
keeping in mind it's paramount to have a safe jail and ensuring our staff have a quality of life and working diligently
in a balancing safety security for our persons in custody as well as our staff
we are using a multi-prong approach working hand in hand to reduce overtime
implement measures to optimize our staff coverage enhance operational efficiency
and maintain fiscal discipline so we begin by reinforcing controls on overtime usage which is
tracked by the office of administration we assigned a dedicated administrative personnel tasked specifically with
oversight and management of of our of our AW walls and personal emergency we
are developing an approval a process for an unauthorized post um the SEOC did help us out and
collaborate with us and they conducted a um post analysis one of our facilities
we are waiting and standing by for approval for that we also restrategized
our redeployments efforts um we enforce our bi-weekly
redeployment assignment for personnels for ancillary post such as the hospitals
um housing areas um schedule scheduled medical appointments as well as mandated
services we increase our redeployment frequency from one week weekly to two
twice a week for our temporary duty assignment officers also we
um we stagger the temporary duty officers on the weekends one one day a
week and one day on the weekends so that we have coverage on the weekends which would that that would increase
our that will increase our um housing area uh staffing ratio
we collaborated with our MAPS teams which is the office of management analysis and planning to advance our
automated systems so that we get a dashboard so that we see real time where we see what where our staff are doing
triples to reduce the unstaffed post and make sure triples and overtime is managed
effectively um this dashboard actively assists commands and reducing triple
tours by identifying excess excessive hours promptly uh we it also provides
commanding uh leadership with immediate visibility into leadership and excuse me
into staffing patterns for facilitating proactive uh response and intervention
we also have pre-approvals for overtime for staff members that are uh restricted for overtime so before they go do
overtime um they have to get pre-approval by the office of administration the office of
administration is do conducting audits to ensure that um all the um affformention mentioned is um in
compliance okay um back in the preliminary budget hearing you were asked if the department um had conducted
an analysis of how many uniform positions could be safely performed by civilians i think you told us at the
time that you'd have the numbers soon do you have uh the results of that analysis what did it find
so we have worked with SEOC to do the staffing analysis for the uniform
members when it comes to our um civilian we have civilian lines we have
established a committee that continues to do that analysis we have in fact
transitioned some uniform members already back into the jails to assume what we call significant um PIC facing
posts this the committee continues to work the deputy commissioners or leaders
to each of the divisions have until the end of this month meaning until the end
of this week to basically do what they need in order for us to then look into
closely how it is that we're able to remove uniform members but in removing
uniform members we need to ensure that we have civilian lines that they can
actually utilize to replace those uniform members so it is ongoing chair
Brennan when we are in a better place we'll be more than happy to share with you and the rest of the committee okay
so as of March we can see that there were around 244 vacant civilian positions is that
number still accurate or or have any of those been filed as you well know the vacancies in civilians are very fluid
you always have on boarding of civilian staff and those that retired or also
moved to other agencies we still have approximately 250 vacancies however you have more than
you had in March yes because of people either moving to different agencies or
retiring the good thing is and I put I would like to put that positive spin as
we come to you this morning is that currently we have over
152 different persons that are being onboarded by our department and so they
are in different stages of the hiring process meaning some of them are still
being vetted by our agency while others are being approved by OM okay so the
preliminary plan included over $4 million in baseline funds for uh
recruitment advertising for corrections officers will there be any recruitment funding uh or any of that money used for
civilian positions we are still concentrating on the
largest of forces that are departing our agency which which area do you have the
highest which area do you have the highest vacancy the highest vacancy that we have is the uniform members sir okay
and and what about the civilian vacancy rates what what area so there are three
specific areas that have a large one that's facility ma uh maintenance
because of the different labor trades that we have in place the other one
happens to be the division of programs and community partnerships but the deputy commissioner has been actively
doing the job postings doing the hiring pools as well as conducting interviews
and submitting the recommendations for hire and then followed by health affairs
health affairs the challenge there is a little different that's more concentrating on cooks that are part of
our nutritional services unit okay i want to talk a little bit about
capital funding then I'm going to turn over to the chair nurse um so DOC repeatedly responds that major
renovations and capital repairs are not possible due to the impending closure of Rikers within the 5-year lifespan uh
requirement are you aware is DOC aware that the department can apply for a waiver from the controllers's office to
wave the 5-year lifespan provision thank you for the question uh we do we
are aware and wherever we can we do uh uh seek a waiver have you applied for
that waiver we have applied to waivers not to the controllers's office but to Dcast instead that's that's
usually where we reach out to for for our 5year span waivers um
so are you are you saying you're not eligible for capital funds in general we we're not in general we have capital
funding to uh further capital projects and improvements if we need to however
on average whenever we uh seek uh additional capital funding or approval
for the ones the capital projects that we have uh our waiverss are not sufficient because of um the impending
uh closure of Rikers okay because I believe that under
directive 10 you can apply for a waiver to the controllers's office and wave the 5-year lifespan provision for capital
projects do you do you not agree with that that assessment we we were not
aware of that but we could look into it
okay um we've been joined by council members Marte Wrestler and Brooks Powers i'm going to turn over to chair nurse
thank you thanks chair um before I
uh ask a few questions on behalf of the speaker I just want to clarify so what can you give uh for the record the types
of capital projects that you've applied for a waiver to Dcast about and just so we can understand the the size of them
uh so uh we generally get waiverss for every kind of capital project going forward uh have you won any of them i'm
sorry have you been able to move forward with any of them uh in the past we have but recently for for instance we'll take
fencing for example when we request waiver waivers for fencing uh we are told that because of the impending
closure of Rikers those waivers despite receiving them uh they're not eligible anymore and they're not perimeter
fencing I'm sorry for what type of fencing in the outside exterior or interior i believe it's perimeter
fencing okay um what other types of large capital that you've you've been rejected for um right now it's just been
that and it's been recently but I I would have to look into it further to be able to it would be great if in the followup uh can you give us u maybe like
the last two years of things that you've applied for waiverss on of course we could we get that big and small thank
you um questions uh on behalf of the
speaker um we all are aware of the points of agreement i won't go into the preamble on it um we just got a
wonderful Friday afternoon update from Mach on the status update on those most of those some of them
um are in the direct jurisdiction of DOC and I'd like to ask um did you assist in
providing updates for your department to that uh update that Mockj gave us
we're going to have Assistant Commissioner Maldonado address your question thank you
good morning um my name is Alex Maldonado and I oversee the buroughbased jail program on behalf of the department
but I also participate um in uh providing updates to the points of agreement uh with our partners at Mark J
okay so you did Yes yes in fact you did insist in providing updates for the department for the one that came on
Friday yes ma'am okay um there's a question here on are people
in custody and Rikers receiving five errors five hours of programming every day as per BOC's minimum standards
i would um I yes they are and I would turn it over to our deputy commissioner for programming uh Nell McCarti if you'd
like further detail
hello my name is Nell McCarti i'm the deputy commissioner for the division of programs and community partnerships uh
so thank you for your question and uh yes people in custody are afforded access to 5 hours of programming but
it's important to note that while afforded um they have the opportunity to
decline um engagement in certain programs so on any given day uh based on
what a person is opting in to engage in it may not look like they are engaging in 5 hours of prayer okay i no thank you
for that um clarification we just ask every time because we know that we've heard that not everyone is getting
access we've we ask this pretty much every single time before it had been questions of staffing and capacity so
for everybody who wants to opt into 5 hours of programming um is that
available to them there are various mechanisms of programs that are available to them okay thank you um has
the RFP for the new in custody programming contracts been posted yet yes i think you mentioned some of that
in your testimony yes actually we're very happy and I'll have Deputy Commissioner Mccardi elaborate what we
thought was going to be a very speedy process going through the challengebased
procurement has demonstrated that it took a little longer but DC Marti will give you the very good news yes so uh
they were posted in January 6th of 2025 uh the um the deadline for the RFP was
February 21st of 2025 we have identified and selected vendors for each of the
RFPs they have all been made aware that they have been selected as the vendors and we're working with them closely on
ensuring um that we are closing the gap on anything with their budget some of them actually had proposed budgets as an
example less than the actual amount that they were awarded so we're working with them to make sure that they are using all of the funds towards the RFP and
right now the stage that we're at is finalizing the master agreements um which are currently we're working in
collaboration with the mayor's office of contracting services or MOX uh to ensure that those are finalized so we get them
registered as quickly as possible uh and that has just again taken a little bit more time um because of the
challengebased vehicle um this being the first of its kind procurement for human services in New York City uh but that
being said we are really excited to get these off the ground rolling um in early fiscal year 2026 so what's the value of
of the services the monetary volume of all the services that are going to be provided in total it's approximately $14
million uh which again we we plan um for fiscal year 26 and that's about what 3
to four million short of what was cut like a couple years ago um from the programming that was
provided so what is the gap uh what have you eliminated in programming that
addresses that gap while this funding um is not a replacement of the $17 million of the PEG that was applied to the
division of programs budget um it is you know it was 17 million that was the PEG uh so this is 14 million so that's
approximately 3 million of the difference um but we would really like to highlight that the programs that were
offered through the PEG um for the targeted jailbased services contract were insourced with our department's
counseling services no I remember we had a we had lengthy conversations here about that um disagree with the the way
you're describing it but sure it's a decrease um and we've talked about the
decrease in programming and and the value we understand all of the insourcing and why it couldn't be done
effectively and that's why we're back here um so I was just wondering if there was a difference in the type of
programming that accounts for that that gap there well um not that accounts for
the gap but I would say the programming is generally different from the targeted jailbased services contract so it's targeting four core areas supplemental
education which is something that we've never pursued before in such a large contract it's also targeting trauma-informed care substance misuse
programming and transitional planning and transportation um so all of those are new uh or maybe transition planning
is the closest that you could get to what was the targeted jailbased services contract okay um for the April and May
updates provided for the category develop new training for correction officers program staff and healthc care
staff uh states that doc and CHS developed a situational awareness training module in 2020 has this
training been updated since
just a yes or no we don't need a whole description of it just a
Hi thank you for that question deputy Commissioner James Saunders um specifically to that question I'm going
to have to say no but I know that there has been other uh training that has been offered i think crisis intervention
deescalation and CIT training that uh that has been provided but we will have to get back to you about that yeah if
you could send a a write up of what that training is that is um kind of complementing or supplanting that um and
then for PACE units um there was a commitment to double the number of PACE units in DOC by the end
of 2020 how many PACE units are in Rikers today so from 2020 to today I
think in 2020 we had five and as of today we currently have 10 and how are we for staffing do we have adequate
staffing for the PACE units so staffing is a combination of uh uniform staff and
CHS staff so I will have to let CHS staff discuss the clinical side and with
respect to operations I'll let the operations folks discuss that but um
with respect to uniform there was a higher number of uniform staff in that type of setting so Okay okay thank you
um in terms of the formation of a culture change committee of the justice
implementation task force it said it was still in progress as of April what is the status of this
committee i think the um the original imagining of the culture change committee um kind of
um stalled uh with the with COVID and sort of the staffing crisis that emerged afterwards but we are working with
Commissioner McInley Litty and and our partners at the administration as well as Mockj to reimagine what that looks
like um understanding that moving into the new burrow-based jails will require a shift um for both our staff and our
individuals in custody and so we're committed to um finding a way to work together better um in the new facilities
so um before the reimagining it so just there's been no there's been no
committee form there's been no meeting there were prior to my um appointment um
there were the the talks had stalled but we are re reinvigorating that now so no
there's been no committee meeting ever not that I'm aware of okay okay um just a few more
questions regarding ICE on Rikers um we've asked every single time
have there been any further discussions since our last hearing regarding ICE opening or setting up operations on
Riker's Island chair as a council aware we're in current litigation regarding that um so we can't
comment on negotiations but right now there's a stay to that um there's no negotiations happening so just to
confirm there have been no further discussions since our last hearing uh well since the last hearing there was
right because that was before the executive order was signed well that was my question so can you tell us when that
was well that was on the just preceding I forget the exact date when the
executive order was signed i have it somewhere but um preceding that we had conversations with the administration
and then um obviously the executive order was signed and now we're in a litigation posture so who would be
present for that conversation who was present for that conversation present I was involved in conversations and who
else who were the who were the staff members from DOC present in that discussion i think really just myself
and the commissioner but I don't think together there was not present through these please can you confirm that in the
follow-up yeah as long as as well as the date um one more question about the
federal monitor and then I'll pass it back to the chair um Chief District Judge Laura
Taylor Swain has ruled that an independent remediation manager will be appointed to work with the department to
develop a phase action plan to create for reform within the jails as you know we'll have to pay the city's going to
have to pay for the remediation manager have you accounted for that in uh or had a conversation with OM for
that in in upcoming budgets there have been no conversations regarding that obviously you know that's that's also in
what will be active litigation is active litigation so we can't comment on that
okay okay i I'll ask other questions after but turning it back over to chair thank you chair okay we've also been
joined by majority leader Faras and council members Kaban and Abrau and
we're now going to turn to questions council member Lewis followed by Narcissis
thank you chairs and good morning first deputy commissioner and your team um three quick questions um I wanted to
know what is the current gender breakdown of the uniform DOC workforce and how does the department project that
will change in FY26 compared to FY25 um in addition to that a follow-up
question to that is what is the FY26 budget allocation for
um sorry the first one is in regards to the breakdown in gender but the second one is in regards to um how will the the
one-time 50,000 increase and federal funding for the prison rape elimination
program be distributed across services such as education facility audits and uh
survivor support and my last question is in regards to burrow-based jails i wanted to know uh what investments are
being made to ensure that the facility meets the demands for more humane environment including mental health
services family visitation and re-entry programming in alignment with community feedback
board member I may have to ask you during the conversation to repeat your question in order for us to ensure that
we address the first points so I'm going to have um Bureau Chief Chief Rembert
give you the specifics of the breakdown on gender by our staff okay
good morning again uh the gender breakdown for males is
3,026 the female breakdown is 2538 on the male gender breakdown is
54.39% on the female is 45.61% 61%
and how will that change in FY26 you mentioned uniform officers they're eligible for about 716 are eligible for
retirement so how does that look for FY26 so keep in mind that that is very
fluid i wish that we could actually project um who will retire we do have
numbers on who is scheduled but keep in mind that there are some members that
decide to stay with us rather than just go that venue we'll be more than happy
to share with you as we see the attrition rate right but do know um
board member Lewis that as a department we are committed to ensuring that we
recruit and that we on board new staff members significantly new recruits it is
something that we are investing in terms of in-person recruitment by our
recruitment unit as well as investments in market marketing such as
announcements in television radio um using social media to bring in um fresh
members right and um which could be a bit more enticing because I've seen them myself and I'm happy that you all are
investing the funds to do that but it could be more enticing but my last two questions and I'll just try to reiterate
them because my time is up how will the onetime $50,000 increase in federal funding for the prison rape elimination
program be distributed across uh services education facility um and
survivor support and the last one is regarding burrow-based jails the investments to make sure that we have everything we need for a humane
environment assistant Commissioner Zuber will respond to the allocation of the
funds while Commissioner um Assistant Commissioner Maldonado will talk to you about the BBJS thanks thank you Council
Member Lewis uh the the one-time increase in $50,000 will be used to procure services for a trauma expert who
uh and the vendor will um de train one staff member and develop a train the
trainer course it is still preliminary um and we just received the funding so
we haven't done anything yet in terms of procuring or It would be good if you could have conversations with the chair
about this just so that we could make sure whoever this trauma expert is is actually meeting the criteria last one's
on buroughbased jails i know council member wrestler is here he's one of the uh members of the committee i know he'll
have a lot of questions about that but just wanted to ask that really quickly thank you chairs
okay we have questions from council member narcissis followed by wrestler
good morning and thank you chairs um what measures are being taken on this
budget to ensure that incarcerated individuals particularly those with
mental health needs have access to adequate mental health services and care
uh their plans to expand access to mental health professionals and crisis
intervention teams within our correctional facilities and second how does this budget address
the recruitment and retention of correctional officers and what is being
done to ensure that staff receive the necessary training to handle complex
issues like mental health crisis deescalation and trauma informed
care thank you for your question um Council Member Narciz Deputy
Commissioner Saunders will open up with remarks and responses relevant to mental health um crisis and crisis intervention
thank you so and can you make it short for me specifically because I have a few others yes sure so as you know you know
our colleagues at CHS operate you know the the clinical side and they have
different specialized housing areas one mental observation caps and pace so you
have uh mental health needs being addressed through through that vehicle in addition there's training provided at
the academy and ongoing training and crisis intervention and deescalation mental health first aid
training and um and including um CPR and
other types of training
i think I had I'm keeping it brief i had a second part i don't think I hear it the budget uh how does this budget
address the recruitment and retention of correctional officers and what being done to ensure the staff receiving the
or the necessary part you said
thank you so much for that question since Commissioner McGinly Liti's
appointment um as commissioner we have been committed to ensuring the wellness
of our staff when it comes to recruitment and retention that is something that we're focusing on in fact
late last year we developed a retention um team consisting of officers and
supported by the deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners from our training academy those retention
officers are the ones that conduct followups with our newly assigned
officers to ensure that they are well
supported by any of us or by them as they go through the new challenges that
they face in this new position but what we have done in um in addition to that
is the office of mental health has awarded our department with a grant that
we have made great strides in we have indeed onboarded new training to support
our staff members such as resiliency and peer tutoring and peer support it is
crucial that as we do that we also continue to invest in development or the
development of wellness centers throughout our department we are happy
to share with you that earlier this month we opened up four wellness centers
we are in total now have six wellness centers that allowed our staff members
to actually be able to go into those areas to assume or have time to process
anything that has transpired i don't have much time but I want to know how many actually using the wellness i was
going to have some question about wellness i'll be more than happy to do a followup and share with you that
specific and one more thing do you have enough staff to escort um PIC's to
medical appointments because last time we were here we're talking about budget do you have budget and are we do we have
enough production of medical um appointments or PIC's to medical appointments continue to be paramount to
us and so it is prioritized on a daily basis oh since my time is short so I
want to say thank you thank you you've been joined by council member Stevens and now we have questions from council
member Wrestler great thank you very much uh thank you to the chairs and to the department of
corrections for joining us today uh I wanted to first ask about the therapeutic beds so we've had 104 beds
completed at Belleview the work is all done ready waiting mothalled because the Department of Corrections refuses to
staff the facility when will the Department of Corrections be opening this facility date please good morning
sir we don't have a date right now we are still working towards uh state commissioning with the state comm uh commission of correction you're waiting
on SEOC approval we are working with the state to gain approval so that we can commission this as a jail facility so
we've the work has been completed for many months um we've been waiting and waiting years delayed to get this open
uh correctional health services is pointing the finger squarely at you all
why has this not gotten done there has been some I think misunderstanding and miscommunication
about this issue we reached substantial completion resulting in the temporary certificate of occupancy however the
SEOC State Commission of Correction requires final completion in order for individuals in custody to be housed
safely in this facility you know why you haven't gone through that process and secured the necessary approvals for a
facility that's been completed that's years behind schedule mayor Adams has the hoodba to talk about wanting to you
know change the burrowbased jail plan and convert a jail into a mental health facility or into a healthcare facility
we have 104 empty beds that are ready to be open but the Department of Corrections won't do its job you have no
date no timeline none right i mean like you continue to have literally just no
information whatsoever for when the site is going to come online the facility is not yet ready to occupy and is not safe
for individuals in custody and you're not prepared to give any frame of time for when it's going to open as soon as
we have a date we will provide it to you okay years of delay and obstinence and obstruction from the Department of
Corrections and we are still at a point where there is no timeline for when you're moving forward let's shift to the
other two new therapeutic bed facilities that are supposed to also open that the Department of Correction has been wholly
uncooperative in moving forward wood Hull and North Central Bronx when are these sites going to open uh sir the
department has been fully uh cooperative in working with uh CHS and our partners at H&H only people who describe you as
cooperative or yourselves in order in order to review and approve the the
design documents for we're years behind schedule early last year we got the deputy mayor for health and human
services when we had people working over there to approve this project uh Deputy Mayor Williams is gave it got a green
light to move these sites forward again after they had been stalled and we've heard no final design has been approved
we are working to approve those designs sir we are working months and years delay right years and years delay you
could be moving the people out of the Department of Corrections who have the most severe health needs but you're not
doing any of the work to actually make it happen in fact you're obstructing every step of the way and you're saying you're moving forward and you're working
cooperatively with no timelines no accountability and no actual milestones
to demonstrate progress i think my staff who work tirelessly on both the burrowbased jail program and the OTHU
program would argue that they are dedicated to this program and to the OTHU program if you don't come before us
with a timeline for when you're going to actually get anything accomplished then there's no accountability sir we can't
we can't account for the SEOC and the timeline that it takes we are working towards those milestones any other
agency that comes before us with capital funding for a project has been in the budget for five years this capital
funding would say these are the dates and the times that we're going to have design completed we're going to have procurement completed we're going to
have construction completed the Department of Correction though just operates in fair in fantasy land and just does whatever it wants whenever it
wants and I don't understand it i like don't understand why you should all have the ability to come before us and give
no information no timeline no accountability it's not how this is supposed to work our job is to ask
questions and get answers and yet every time you come before us we get nothing so I I this was just one topic i could
have done 10 topics but the answers would have all been the same no information no substance no accountability that is the hallmark for
the Department of Corrections under Eric Adams
thank you Council Member uh I have one or two questions i'm going to turn it back to Chair Nurse uh in the
preliminary plan um DOC received a almost a $4.5 million increase for
nutritional services yet at the border of corrections meeting on uh May 13 of
this year there were multiple complaints about the food including allegations that there were not enough food for
everyone and that people were not receiving food per their dietary or religious uh restrictions so what's
being done to address those complaints
thank you for the question turn your mic hi Deputy Commissioner James Saunders thank you for the question so I can tell
you that we have approximately 7,500 PIC persons in in custody as of today the
nutritional services division prepares over 20,000 meals daily within that
number are a number of specialized meals for individuals who declare themselves
to be of a certain religion and we have plenty of specialized meals for
individuals who request a uh a kosher meal um we also have specialized meals
for individuals who have a therapeutic need so if there's a specific complaint
I'd be happy to take it back to the team and address it i mean I'm I I guess we're talking about in this meeting on
May 13th there were multiple complaints made at the border correction meeting including allegations that there was not
enough food and that people who have dietary or religious
uh restrictions were not getting that food you're not aware of that so Chair
Brandon any complaint that is brought to our attention is immediately addressed by the area that is supposed to be
responsible for nutritional services would have been addressed by Deputy
Commissioner Saunders and his entire team okay but he just said he's not aware of
the complaint we're not brought to us directly brought
to us directly with a name of a person that complains in order for us to just
not look at the complaint of the person but how that complaint has impacted an
entire area is something that we would have addressed okay back in March um DOC
said they were looking to hire an assistant commissioner to oversee nutritional services has that position
been filled the interview process has been conducted and the name of the candidate has been
um submitted for vetting okay um do you have enough staff to escort
all the people in custody to medical appointments
so there's no magic number to to give you right now to say that there is you
know we need 300 individuals to escort i can tell you that out of the 640 or so
thousand scheduled appointments for an average daily population of 6,900 there are enough staff the vast majority of of
nonp production is due to individuals not wanting to go to their clinic
appointment um and less than 1% of clinic non-production relates to there
not having an escort available and in the case where there is no escort
available we work very closely with CHS to have the individual rescheduled for
later in the day or for the following day
all right I'm going to turn it back to chair nurse thanks thanks i just wanted to follow up on the
therapeutic units sorry to bring you back up
um can you tell me about the the nature of working with the state commission like when was the last time you all had
a meeting together or you wait like what's outstanding just so that we have a little bit more sense
of what you're dealing with sure um they uh visit the site at Belleview at least
once a month and I believe our last walkthrough was approximately two weeks ago um and uh following those meetings
and we meet we discuss the transition and they also walk the site following those meetings they send a letter to our
commissioner uh detailing the the the expectations that they would need to meet commissioning and sort of the
progress therein um so there are some some significant construction items that are still outstanding um that our team
DC Dohy and his team will have to uh complete um there are also Can you talk
can you elaborate just a little bit more on some of those on the construction items sure just to understand how
significant they are some of the um design uh fixtures uh that were in place
are behavioral health fixtures and so we are remedying those to be uh correctional grade um fixtures because
this is a detention grade facility and under the state commission those are required what kind of fixtures are just
exit signs okay um staff stations there's glazing on the staff stations okay for example um there's also some
trim that's utilized that's metal trim for example um that we wouldn't put in a in a detention facility so those things
are being remedied by our team um we also have uh policies that we've submitted to the SEOC for review and
approval um we received feedback recently so we're in in a sort of a an editing process with them uh we also
have training our training academy is working with our team and CHS as well in order to develop training
multidisciplinary training for everybody who will be assigned to this facility so that's ongoing the SEOC will have to
approve those um but the biggest obstacle in true transparency is our staffing issue um as has been described
here today staffing uh is a problem uh for for the department currently and um
this is a staffing rich model um the efficiencies are not maximized in this particular facility so we are working
again with the state to identify which posts are mandatory in order to provide a safe and secure environment for both
sta staff and people in custody okay so it one it would be great to get that out if you could provide in the follow-up
that outstanding list i think that would help um members understand why you know what's going on so we don't assume
nothing's going on and then two um in terms of staffing you so you've
submitted a staffing plan and the state has rejected it or you haven't developed a sting a staffing plan and you're in
process with that can you just I mean how many people are you needing my understanding is CHS will be managing
the the staffing um and budget for that am I corre correct in that um I'm not
sure they will certainly be handling their own uh staffing and and their assignments uh for the medical services
and mental health services however the department will oversee the depart uh the facility as a whole and will manage
its own staffing um in terms of budget those staff members come out of our lines of of budget um we do we did have
a we submitted a draft staffing plan to the state commission of correction um it was approximately 280 staff members when
was that when did you submit that was it in this year it was this Okay forgive me i don't remember the dates but at our
last I believe at our last couple hearings we discussed that it was about approximately 280 staff members needed
that's including staff members for all three tours all of the posts as well as um coverage factors right for people who
are out or what have you um and so those that was 200 approximately 280 needed to
be assigned um the state came back uh with its post analysis and they
described 99 posts that would be needed um to to manage this facility however
that does not take into account local regulations as well as that does not take into account some of our collective
bargaining agreements so we are currently in the process of working with the state to figure out what that number really is when you take into account all
of these other factors the state says you need 99 cos posts posts I'm sorry
and then you're accounting for you know the tours and backup in case people call
do all of that other work um so it's still over approximately over 200 and those pieces are part of collective
bargaining or are those separate pieces some of those pieces are part of collective bargaining um that require a
certain number of posts for depending on what the um the uniform rank is so again we're kind of working through those
details and certainly welcome an opportunity to talk offline when do you when do you anticipate sending something
back to the state in short order within like a couple months oh certainly
within a couple of months i mean we're in regular communication with them and this staffing plan would be required for
commissioning and when's their next uh visit or when's your next scheduled meeting with them i believe it's next
month um they come down for for both the Belleview project as well as the Burbase jail project okay
[Music] um ask question oh uh Council Member Althia do you want to ask a question
hello good morning i just have a question um I I have a a colleague and and friend
who's has a sibling who's in jail and they have an issue around we need to
know how many lockdowns and nonmovements that's happening in the JRVC building
because um they got word that they have been locked down for a number of days and just trying to see how often these
lockdowns are taking place um what are the cause of some of these lockdowns um because we have some serious concerns
And this was like apparently like a week or two ago to give you a general overview on
lockdowns I'll have senior deputy commissioner Fra
good morning man sc FRA in reference to the lockdowns of GRVC or any other facility on um on Riker's Island those
are generally based on acts of violence or uh the locks on appointments that
occur in those facilities so as for instance this weekend there were three acts of violence in one facility which
means we'd have to lock the facility down to make sure all the PE persons in custody are safe and before we open back
up to search for possible weapons and things of that nature uh this week so do you have like an average on how how
often these lockdowns are taking place i don't have an average in front of me right now but I can provide that to you
uh after this meeting in your future and so um like so obviously how long does
the the lockdown typically take place cuz what I'm hearing it was for a couple weeks and um we she doesn't know the
building that the unit he's in she just knows it's JRVC the building and she
doesn't know what um house he's in there is no couple weeks of lockdown
it's a day several days depending on the circumstance and how many happen in that facility and the time it takes for us to
have enough staff to search and to make sure that it's render how of how long does it typically take your staff to
search if there is an active violence or something like that if there's only one active violence usually they activate uh
some of the units to go up there instantaneous when it happens if it's overnight they're locked down until we can get the personnel sometimes the
facilities we we ask security staff to start doing the searches on their own but it varies i can't give you specifics
on the exact timing on how long each takes but it's based on the severity of the circumstances and the situation and
it's a fluid situation if we have a situation where there's you know 10 or so people in in reference to violence
and three or four going to the hospital that puts a strain on us to manage the facility also so those are all the
considerations that take place i can give you more information at a later date exactly how many we've had the past
month and where where we rectified them oh yeah definitely um if you could follow up offline and definitely give me
um how many has taken place in the last month how long and the the length that they were um and I'll also try to get
the exact house that we had got these reports from that they were on lockdown for a number of of weeks um and just try
to get an understanding of what's happening thank you receive
m I said I can give you some information on for instance November 2024 EMTC had
32 all the way to May of 2025 so for the month of uh from November 2024 to May of
25 EMTC had 32 lockin situations grvc uh
the facility from the month of November 2024 to May 2025 they had 75 so all of
that day so you're specifically in resident GRVC so those are the numbers for the GRVC i'm sorry say that again
i'm sorry those are the numbers for GRBC it's 75 they had 75 lockdowns between November and and till May until May i
can't tell you the length but those are the exact numbers for those instances okay and just in general council members
uh the last go-to really is to lock down a house it really does depend on a situation we have tried to strive not to
lock down an entire facility and prefer if there's a specific concentrated situation in the housing area to just
open up the entire facility and just keep that specific housing area on lockdown so it really is a case-byase
basis but yes if you can certainly get us the housing area that would be super helpful for us to give you that feedback
no no listen I understand that there there's a line and we have to make sure that we're keeping everyone safe but
from what we were hearing that they there was a number of weeks where they were locked down and and folks couldn't get in touch with them and it was
causing a lot of issues and so I'll definitely follow up um offline to get you the exact house cuz I think she's
working on that now but um 75 is a lot and so thinking about what are we doing to mitigate the violence so that we can
have less violent outbreaks and things like that and so I think all of those things um need to be considered because
if there was 75 between November and May um is locking down is that working cuz
you know for me it's always thinking about are there other solutions and what are other ways for us to think about but
um I will get that information i'll follow up thank you Councilwoman Stevens um the lockins uh there's a process so
you could do a 1-hour lock in if there you suspect an incident that's going to occur then we have a housing area lock
in a facility lock in and also we could have uh a partial lock in where two of
the persons in custody must locked in for their own safety concern so we could bring them out so when we talk about
lock in emergency lock in there's there's a there there are steps and levels to it it's not just we lock it in
it depends on what it is now when um SEC uh FRAJ spoke about 75 for GRBC we have
to determine was a housing area locked in was it a departmental lock in was it
a uh facility lock in or was a h a partial lock in and was it just an hour
lock in with the assistant deputy water can lock in they were saying specifically it was a lockdown and
nonmovement and this was going on for several weeks so um that that's the bulk of the information I had so I know
obviously they're going to be different circumstances and things like that and so um I just you know like I said it's
more asking like what's the process and obviously it's different circumstances different levels yes ma'am different
levels different stages so you definitely give us that information we check and get back with you yeah and also again like just thinking about like
what are if and I know the tools are limited um I don't want to pretend like we don't have limited tools but thinking
about is are there other things that we could be doing too so but I'll I will follow up with you guys offline just to
get you some more information um because we were trying to come to facility but our schedule's in the line but there was
there was quite some um there was some concerns because she we couldn't get in touch with her
brother for quite some time so thank you yes ma'am
okay um thank you council member i wanted to touch on the um Cisco virtual
visitation platform um wanted to know will this platform be available on the personal tablets
uh something we can certainly explore we're still working with the vendor and we're currently in the procurement
process but we do know that Cisco application would help kind of streamline the current virtual visit
platform and kind of reduce our reliance on Microsoft Teams for both family visits virtual visits as well as
attorney virtual visits um if not on personal tablets how are you all envisioning this the setup to be first
tapping into our existing um kind of apparatuses and platforms throughout the facilities and then kind of exploring if
we need to either expand it in other places so people can have access we'll obviously have a conversation about
tablets as well as scheduling uh a scheduling platform for scheduling inerson visits which I think recently
passed okay um and the Lightning Law Discovery Sharing
Platform can you uh just for the record I don't think we've talked about it here at this hearing uh or in this committee
for um before maybe we did i'm sorry but can you just for the record explain how
the platform will work we're going to have our deputy um
general counsel yeah i so I'm I'm not incredibly versed on the technical
aspects of it but essentially what it does it allows an attorney to share all
types of discovery directly with the client so it it would encompass records
i believe video is part of that as well so anybody want camera type things it's something that is direct from the
attorney to the client they could review the discovery um I I think there's an element of a communication the kind of a
messaging back and forth but um we we envision it and and as do the defense bar to be something that really helps to
facilitate um an advanced review of the discovery before they meet with them
because what ends up happening is if you have to do it all at one time it becomes protracted visits and I think they want
to accelerate this so that when they have the appearances it's kind of taken care of before the court appearances and
so this will be kind of set up similar to the the uh visitation area no
actually I think this is going to be on the tablets oh this is on the table yes the lightning law will be on the tablets and um kiosks in the law library the um
the virtual visits is going to be for now in kiosks got
it okay um in terms of the uh opioid opioid stimulant and substance program
um you we've got money for hiring five addiction counselors to provide persons in custody with individual plans
counseling connection to community based organizations when do you all anticipate filling these positions
hello Mccertie again uh so we have interviewed for the five um positions we
have actually submitted for them as well so we are considering them in the pipeline we're waiting for them to uh
get their final vetting to be able to onboard them okay great we are also posting for a supervisor um so that
should be going up shortly okay and we see that the funding stops after fiscal year uh 27 um is there any reason for
that that you're aware of that was the length of the grant um so this is a grant-f funed uh position and so the
length of the grant is is for those few years and we we hope to be able to bring those folks on um full-time with our own
lines okay uh I wanted to ask a question well while you're up here we have um
just one more programming question um you had 34 vacancies in the division of
programming um which credited for the lack of staff to your inability to meet the mandatory
5 hours how many of those positions have been filled and how many are still vacant i think you answered this earlier
but just Yeah so when we last um spoke and we came up with uh or we spoke about
that number we reduced that number down to 12 vacancies um with the addition of a few actually new needs that came in we
currently have 20 vacancies but those weren't accounted for when we were speaking at the preliminary budget hearing so I just want to flag that and
those actually include like the five lines for the substance misuse counselors that we're trying to to bring
in in the pipeline um so right now it's 20 uh that we have as true you know
vacancies okay um transitioning to cell
doors uh the preliminary plan included a baseline 2.5 million increase for cell
doors um just a question on how many doors have been replaced so far using these funds
morning thank you for the question uh Kevin Dhy deputy commissioner facility maintenance repair
division for fiscal year 25 are you speaking for the 2.5 allocated for
fiscal year 25 or let me see how it's written here is not
it's not Yeah look it just says um how how much did you spend in FY25 on doors
actually let me start there so for fiscal year 25 not accounting for
the 2.5 that was allocated in as of March yes we have installed 177 doors
okay do you provide do you purchase doors from the same provider
every time we we allocate we go through our jocks
contractor and we provide spec very specific uh requirements for the doors
uh for the doors that we have allocated currently they are they do come from uh
one specific vendor one specific vendor right there's like I'm sure there's not like that many jail door builders out
there correct okay so um
uh the funding specifically to purchase new doors um that's put in the plan is
that to cover the cost for new parts or whole new doors or does it also cover
personnel costs associated with that so for the for the $2.5 million that was
baselined from fiscal year 25 till 29 that is for the full and complete
installation of doors so that comes with door frame door itself locking
mechanisms door hinges removal cost installation cost as well as manpower
cost and is the uh who does the labor for that contractor outside okay
is it generally the same contractor every time so for the 177 doors prior to
the 2.5 allocated this year that was done by in-house trades okay uh and
we specifically did it in areas of the
higher classification okay so previously doors were done by
in-house trades moving forward it will be outsourced through contractors
correct okay
okay uh I'm going to ch transition to a conversation about the state prison
facilities um well the clos the closure of three additional state prison
facilities um and wondering what have been the nature of the conversations between you
all and state corrections on how to get folks who are sentenced and waiting to
to move upstate off of Rikers so thank you very much for that question our
conversations with the state are ongoing our commissioner continues to have those
conversations on a weekly basis our custody management unit also has those
conversations on a daily basis the challenge for the state right now is
that as it opened its intake it's not just taking persons from our our own
jurisdiction but rather the entire state and so the conversations are ongoing
it's not a secret that we are and have been managing a bed capacity um
challenge our staff and our members of very specific divisions and you and
units have really done an incredible job in basically ensuring that we have all
the necessary cells all the necessary housing areas that we have a bed for
every person that remains in our care as well as those that are coming in but the
conversations chair are ongoing ongoing I imagine has the state provided a date in which any date or any timeline in
which they'll resume upstate transfers so they have already opened up as of May 5th the numbers that they're taking for
us are not ideal because they need to basically take from every county i think
that we they have taken so far um approximately 87 persons that are state
ready but the number and the challenge that we have is that those who are
deemed state ready right now are a large number for us what's the number
it exceeds 900 as of today is 900 um 12 state ready
okay okay um for people who are nearing
uh their parole eligibility date have you discussed the possibility of facilitating parole board hearings at
Rikers i I've had conversations with with Docs
and um their council um well not directly with their council assistant commissioners about that i I mean I
think we really have to look at exactly what you're talking about and I've mentioned this you know because as we go along people are credited with the time
that they were in our custody to begin with so I think there's a circumstance where they're approaching a lot of those
um you know those end of sentence or parole eligible type dates uh they've
committed to do that again unfortunately because of of what the first deputy commissioner said that they're doing it
statewide you know they haven't been able to dedicate anyone to us directly yet but but that's our hope because I
think it's it's a really important thing that they need to look at okay uh just a couple more
questions uh and actually General Counsel I'll stick with you um with
regards to the DOI uh deadlocking investigation are there any updates that you can share no that's ongoing and as a
matter of fact we just had a communication with them this morning um where we're facilitating some uh transfer of discovery for them okay
there we I believe we heard that there was a internal memo that was distributed to staff about uh about deadlocking to
discourage this practice that That's correct that happened that's right it was back when this first was raised at
the board of correction meeting we did circulate it at that time is it possible for you to share that with the council sure yeah we can follow up with that
yeah okay um and one other question similarly um
under the investigation investigations uh around uh Charisma Jones um they
found that she was repeatedly denied medical care even after being transferred to the infirmary with staff
claiming that she was on medlock um and officers stopped medical staff from entering her cell multiple times to
check her vitals as you know she was later rushed to the hospital pronounced dead from mult multiorgan failure um can
you clarify uh what being on medlock means and under what conditions someone
would be put on medlock so so medlock is um it's not something that we find in in
our operational directives it's more something that's colloquial term it's um
medical um lock in so in that facility particular Rose M Singer um there is no
communicable disease unit so that is what would be used at that time uh it's
just something where there is a a condition where they can't be otherwise in the dorm areas or um you know in
other facilities that they're they're sent there um it's also sometimes used in circumstances when uh a person newly
in intake has not been medically cleared so where they won't consent to search procedures or otherwise so that's that's
what that area is specifically so who makes those determinations in a in a
facility um it's it's done by in certain circumstances CHS would make that
determination and others it's again on the security front when they've not been cleared i think it's done by our intake
um and that's communicated outward to uh wardens on the floor your deputy wardens
on the floor like how does that trickle down for someone to know that this this uh young woman was on the colloially
termed medlock i think it specifically has to yes I think it has to go to the the facility leadership though again I I
don't know the exact processes and and the dissemination of information but the wardens in those facilities would know who's supposed to be assigned to those
areas would you mind providing the protocol for that so we can understand how that is determined under what
conditions and how that gets commun how it's supposed to be communicated out yeah as I mentioned that's that's a colloquial term that's kind of used for
that i know that but if someone is being put aside for some kind of quarantine or
something or u medical staff are being denied to go check up on someone there
must be a there i imagine there's a protocol with that and if not that's we have a serious problem so if there is
one we'd like to have it we certainly will thank you
i believe those are all Oh oh final question um how many people have been released
via 6A year to date in 2025
hello uh so for 6A year to date is 34 people so this is January to date 34 as
in 34 34 okay 34 people and how many people are working reviewing and working
on those types of cases yes thank you for that question uh so we have an assistant commissioner assigned to our
reintegration unit uh underneath that assistant commissioner is an executive director of reintegration as well as a
director of reintegration uh last year for example at this time we had one person part-time reviewing individuals
for 6A at this time we have three people uh reviewing individuals or um
candidates for 6A three people so three people assigned to just review cases is that what they
do fully it they have other responsibilities but this is part of their responsibility so three people
okay okay those are our question my questions i'll turn it back over to
Chair Brandon okay thank you all very much for your testimony and we look forward to working with you going
forward thank you thank you thank you we're going to take a I'm sorry um Coun
chairs um this is Council Member Kat i'm so sorry i I just I passed along a couple of questions to the chairs i
don't know if it's possible to ask them on my own oh we just Yeah we just got Yep yep yep we just got them now we'll
ask sorry I just got Thank you we don't We don't have quarums so Council Member Kaban can't ask her questions but we're
going to ask them for her um it's related to the 6A program actually um in March you testified that
498 people serving city sentences were eligible for early release through the 6A program in this month's board of
correction meeting your staff called the current situation in the jails with the sharp rise in the jail population
unprecedented and board members urge you to respond to this crisis by using 6A as widely as the department did in March
2020 when over 300 people were released in one month have you considered applying the same criteria that was
applied in March 2020 to uh expand 6A releases no um chair nurse if I may
clarify the number that was quoted earlier is the number of sentenced
individuals that were assigned to our custody only sentenced individuals can
be considered for 6A when we talk about 6A we talk about doing an internal
analysis of the entire history of that sentenced individual that could be
potentially considered there are very specific criteria of um charges that
will not allow that person to be considered for 6A um but just because we
have x amount of sentenced doesn't mean that all of those sentences individuals
can be released into 6A and so the team member that deputy commissioner McCarti
has described to you it is their responsibility to actually look at every
single sentence individual to determine if they are eligible for the 6A program
what's the what's the a I mean well what you've testified is that you don't actually have full-time like a full-time
staffer just dedicated to reviewing cases you have three people who have other responsibilities but also work on
this so I think that's an issue given the potential eligibility of 498 people
um and I guess I'm wondering um what's the average length that a review process
is that's a great question so um and just to also highlight we are looking at
making a full-time staff person um that literally this is their sole responsibility but right now we've just
divided it between three people um but the average length really varies and so based on what um the initial review
might take for one person you know a day or a few days um for that initial let's
check on their charges let's see if they have um you know any open cases things
that might be easier to stream through um but then it can take up to two weeks for us to go and review their full
folder uh which is paperbased like reviewing of any additional forms anything that could be literally a
judge's order for them not to be considered um for early release or rather not even early release um for a
program such as 6A and what would you say the percentage of time per each of those three staff people is spent on
case review i mean I can verify for one of them it's it's multiple hours of their day okay so
I I think the the point um a point the council member would like
to make if she was able to speak for herself um in March 2020
um there was about 300 people released only nine were rearrested for any charge
less than 1% which is only two people were rearrested for a violent felony um
and so this is clearly a a program and a pathway that would work and it I think
it would be really great to get that full staff member on um in any other capacity that would be needed given the the situation with upstate inability to
transfer the mental health blockage upstate as well and then what we have um
the over you know the census population growing so council member just to add we happy we're happy to look into possibly
expanding what the team looks like that review these 6A applications but also just to put it on the record like March
2020 looks very different than May 2025 and so did our population so to the FDC's point the people who are sentenced
now the makeup of their offenses look very different than the people who were in our in our population in March of
2020 and just to underscore like March 2020 that was COVID right so people were released and most of them probably
sheltered in place right and these were people who had lower offenses but we are definitely and we've had conversation
and committed to looking into possibly figuring out how we can expand the unit to create a more systematic review of
those applications but I know it's something that has definitely been a priority for the FDC and DC Marty as well as the commissioner yeah it would
be great if you could provide that statistical data to back up what you're saying in terms of what the top charge
of folks were that were released because what we're seeing is you know only two people rearrested and it's not even
clear if there was a conviction on any val uh violent top charge okay that was it thank you great
thank you all very much all right so we're going to take a break we will reconvene at around noon and
we'll hear from the mayor's office of immigrant affairs

We're ready to begin thank you Sergeant good afternoon
and welcome to second portion of today's executive budget hearings we're going to hear uh today this afternoon from the um
Commissioner Castro and the mayor's office of immigrant affairs i'm Council Member Brandon i chair the committee on
finance and I'm pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague Council Member Alexis Avilis who chairs the committee
on immigration we've been joined this afternoon by Council Member Salam Lewis Hanife and Moya uh welcome Commissioner
Castro and your team thank you for joining us today to answer our questions on May 1st 2025 the administration
released the executive financial plan for FY26 to 29 with her proposed FY26
budget of $115.1 billion moya's projected FY26
budget of 781,962 represents less than 1% of the
administration's uh proposed budget in the executive plan and it remains unchanged from the amount budgeted for
Moya in the administration's preliminary plan back in January
my questions today will largely focus on Moya's priorities as well as capacity legal support services and language
access for various city agencies but I now want to turn to my co-chair for this hearing council member Ailles for her
her opening statement thank you so much chair um good good
afternoon i'm council member Alexa chair of the committee on immigration thank you all for joining us at this fiscal
2026 executive budget hearing for the mayor's office of immigrant affairs otherwise known as Moya i would like to
thank my fellow council member Chair Brandon for joining me at this joint hearing and also would like to thank
Commissioner Castro and other members of the administration who are with us today uh I want to take a moment to
acknowledge uh the precious and ongoing contributions that immigrant New Yorkers make to our city every single day
culturally and economically immigrants are the heartbeat of our neighborhoods and a vital part of the fabric of not
only New York City but the country as a whole and yet daily we've seen our federal government threaten the safety
and vitality of our immigrant New Yorkers just this weekend a high school student in the Bronx was detained after
showing up to what he thought was a routine uh court date and ever since has
been prevented from see receiving desperate medical care or service from
his legal counsel stories like this will only become more common in our city
under this Trump administration particularly if we are not funding the organizations that provide the direct
services and/or education to immigrant communities i would also like to recognize that the
work the city has undertaken to support immigrants health particularly in expanding access to care through
initiatives like New York City care and providing emergency health services along with disease prevention uh
prevention care to those who most cannot who cannot afford it regardless of their
immigration status these are critical steps to ensure that our new neighbors
remain healthy and we commend the city agencies and community partners working tirelessly to meet the needs of our
diverse communities our city government is the last line of defense in providing
crucial services to our most vulnerable communities that being said we must also
be honest about the gaps that remain and how the proposed fiscal 2026 executive
budget misses the mark of further supporting the enormous work that
community-based organizations are doing on the ground prioritizing and adequately funding legal services again
adequately funding legal services and language access should not be negotiable
these are essential components to a just and equitable city and when these supports fall short it impacts the lives
and livelihoods leaving our new neighbors and old neighbors vulnerable
at every moment they need for stability and protection further compounding this
challenge is the federal house approved budget reconciliation bill which proposes new penalties for states that
offer healthcare to undocumented immigrants this is deeply troubling development that threatens New York's
ability to continue using state funds to support essential care it risks widening
existing disparities and could undermine our longstanding commitment to being a
city that welcomes and cares for all we cannot claim to be a sanctuary city while simultaneously scaling back the
very support that makes that vision real this administration has had both the
time and the resources to build a comprehensive and compassionate response unfortunately we've seen much of
reactive decisions underinvestment and and very much missed opportunities new
York City has long been a safe haven for immigrant communities including the growing number of unaccompanied minors
who arrive here seeking safety and stability this young population faces
tremendous challenges navigating immigration court alone and the executive budget lacks any dedicated
funding to address the ad to address this unique need cancelled contracts
also has meant loss of hundreds of jobs in New York City as well this
administration and the council has a responsibility to ensure that our city budget reflects our values and
acknowledges the truth of this time and yet throughout the budget exercise we
see the administration acting like nothing is quite happening in the broader context and it would much rather
waste taxpayer dollars in advancing Trump's agenda than harnessing everything in our city's power to
protect immigrants it is unconscionable highly alarming and profoundly harmful
to immigrant communities before we hear from Moy I would like to thank committee staff Karolina Gil Florentine Kabore
Nicole Kata Rebecca Barila as well as my dedicated staff Edward Cerna and
Christina Bautego for their unwaving commitment and hard work with that thank
you chair thank you chair going to turn it over to the committee council Brian Saro to swear you in and we can begin
good afternoon do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this committee and to
respond honestly to council member questions commissioner Commissioner Castro Deputy Commissioner Sanchez
I do deputy Commissioner Lucero I do you may begin thank you Chair Az and Chair
Brennan and the Committee on Immigration and the Committee on Finance for holding this budget hearing my name is Manuel
Castro and I serve as the commissioner of the mayor's office of immigrant affairs i'm joined today by Jasnia
Sanchez deputy commissioner of administration and strategic initiatives and Lorena Lucero deputy commissioner of
programs and policy in my testimony I will discuss fiscal year 2026
uh budget and our priorities but before I begin I want to speak directly to New
York City's immigrant communities

health hospitals
quentones
now in English I know this is a difficult time i know many are feeling
fear fear of being separated from their loved ones fear of having to leave their
place the place that they have now call their home or even fear simply being
seen i felt that fear i crossed the border when I was just 5 years old and
grew up undocumented in this very city i know that it what it's like to try to build a life while carrying uncertainty
every single day so I want to take this moment to say this to you clearly and directly our immigrant communities as
you've heard from the mayor and from our city's leadership keep accessing all city services without fear as you've
heard directly from the school's chancellor continue to send your children to school from the police
commissioner if you witness or experience a crime call 911 from the
president of our health and hospital system and the commissioner of the department of health and mental hygiene
seek care at our public hospitals and city administered health programs when
you need them and I can go on and on because this city has people public servants educators healthcare workers
your neighbors who care deeply about your safety and your future these are
not only city services they are your rights and they are here for you but
most importantly don't lose faith don't lose hope continue to live your life and
don't let fear win now let me begin with a brief overview of where we stand i'm
glad to share that all of Moya's funding is preserved in the executive budget for fiscal year 2026 and we are entering the
new fiscal year with a proposed budget of approximately 29.6 million the
largest budget since the office was created this budget allows to continue strengthening MOYA's programs and
infrastructure across key pillars immigration legal and support services English language learning language
access community engagement and communications to our immigrant communities we will build on three and a
half years of sustained missiondriven work during which Moya has delivered more services than at any other time in
the office history while responding to multiple crisis impacting immigrant communities during this time we've
significantly expanded access to immigration legal and support services English classes language support and
more we've also managed a record number of contracts with immigrants serving
nonprofits ensuring our efforts remain deeply rooted in the community moya aims
to use its funding in the most strategic way to meet the emerging needs of immigrant communities on immigration
legal services in fiscal year 26 we are working to a establish our new MOYA
immigration legal support centers and b extend contracts to existing legal
providers we are on track to launching the Moya immigration legal support
centers initiative for fiscal year 26 by July 1st this initiative is a 6.4 4
million annually funded program that will support 25 immigrant serving
nonprofit contractors contractors to provide culturally and linguistic responsive immigration legal services in
immigrant dense neighborhoods in addition we are extending existing contracts with immigration legal service
providers through fiscal year 26 and incorporating them into our MOYA centers
model this new model represents an evolution of ActionNYC and past
approaches it incorporates changes that meet the current and emerging needs of
New York City's immigrant communities and places services directly in immigrant neighborhoods we will also
continue to operate the Moya immigration legal hotline in partnership with Catholic Charities in 2024 alone the
hotline received over 64,000 calls connecting immigrant New Yorkers to
consultations and trusted referrals amongst our providers another cornerstone of our work is English
language instruction our MOYA English learning program run in partnership with
New York City's three public library systems currently offers English classes at nearly 60 branches and community
centers across the city during my tenure we developed a comprehensive beginner level curriculum that had been widely
requested by both advocates and learners and was missing from the curriculum now
the curriculum is available at all levels of proficiency not only and it not only teaches English but connects
immigrants to city resources and services helping our communities navigate life in New York City with
greater confidence and independence as with previous years language access remains a key priority for Moya over the
last several years we've worked hard to build an in-house team of experts that now provide translation and
interpretation services for mayoral offices and technical assistance to over 45 city agencies helping them comply
with local authority and meaningful meaningfully expand language access across city government in April we
launched the I Speak campaign as part of our immigrant heritage week encouraging all New Yorkers to request services in
the language they're most comfortable with and reminding agencies of their obligations to provide it community
engagement remains at the heart of our work as we seek to be an office deeply rooted in community in 2025 alone Moya's
external affairs and outreach team has made more than 10,000 direct touch points with immigrant New Yorkers
through resource fairs tablely know your rights presentations days of action canvasing and through our Axmoya email
and hotline we also launched the New York rights for immigrant New Yorkers campaign across more than 4,000 digital
screens across New York City ensuring that accurate multi multilingual information is reached by communities
citywide in a time of uncertainty uncertainty and misinformation Moya's communications efforts help ensure
immigrant New Yorkers received information from trusted messengers in their own language for example in recent
months we partnered with the department of health and mental hygiene for multilingual media roundt on healthc
care access and and collaborated with the department of housing preservation and development the communi commission
on human rights and the mayor's public engagement union for a press briefing on housing rights these events drew over 46
ethnic and community media outlets with coverage in Chinese Udu Korean Arabic
Spanish Bangla and more combined these stories received over 1 million impressions directly reaching immigrant
audiences with timely and accurate information lastly I want to thank the
many public servants across city agencies and offices who continue to show up for immigrant New Yorkers and to
our team at the mayor's office of immigrant affairs for their commitment and for continuing to show up for all
immigrant communities i am proud of what we've accomplished together and I remain committed to ensuring New York City
remains a national model for immigrant services and opportunity thank you again
for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your questions thank you Commissioner also been joined by Council
Member Dear Rosa um a couple of questions for me and then I want to really turn it over to the chair um
during the preliminary budget hearing uh you stated that the immigrant rights collaborative was planning an additional
know your rights uh workshops in schools and and was had a goal of completing 240
workshops could you tell us if if we've met that goal or or uh how we're looking
yes um we have not met that goal but we are on our way um we currently have
about 80 trainings left okay and could you give us an idea of how the the burrow equity shakes out
there how many are happening in each burrow are you trying to do an equal amount in each burrow um so I don't have
the burough breakdown but I can tell you that um the way that it was designed it was to prioritize uh folks who were in
shelter schools um and faith-based institutions and I do have the breakdown
there if you want that uh yeah that'd be great so in shelters um uh we've done
about 52 trainings so far in schools we've done 47
um and then um 14 have been at faith-based institutions
and has the the cruelty and chaos coming from Washington impacted attendance at
these workshops better or worse or
I think there's been several things that have impacted attendance um but I I can
say that there has been um when we first started the workshops there were more people coming um because of that we had
to pivot um so instead of doing in person we had to move to doing them online to meet uh the low decline in
numbers so there's no additional funding added in FY26 for the immigrant rights
collaborative do we assume that the program will be discontinued beyond FY25
um if I can add um thank you for the question um so the immigrant right uh
collaborative was uh an emergency um uh push uh as part of our office to
increase the number of uh know your rights uh workshops uh so that was uh something that we did for uh for the
second half of uh FY25 in FY26 the immigrant drives workshops program
itself continues and is fully funded u so we will continue to fund uh the 17 uh
community based organizations that have been contracted yearly uh to continue that work did you ask the administration
for more funding considering everything that's going on right now uh we have been in close communications with uh
with our partners at OMB to assess uh the the needs of our programs
okay uh during the preliminary budget hearings you stated that Moya uh were developing an intranet for all city
agencies to better access Moya's resources could you give us the status update of that and and when do you
anticipate it might go live yes we're working uh with our multiple
city agency partners uh to develop this intra uh internet and we'll be launching
uh very soon um we're hoping to be launched uh by the next fiscal year what's the budget for the project uh we
are using existing funds for uh this project you're they're making you use your own MOYA funding they're not the
funding is not housed in a different uh agency uh no we're working closely with uh our partners at our OTI to develop
this website existing using existing funds
and h how does Moya utilize ethnic media to keep New York and in general and immigrants uh in particular informed
yes we hold um um ethnic and immigrant meeting roundts on a regular basis we
aim to have at least one per month uh if not per quarter uh as I mentioned in my
testimony we held recently two very successful immigrant media ethnic
roundts one to highlight access to health care and another to uh highlight
immigrant rights and housing uh this is incredibly important work that we prioritize uh because we know that uh
over a third of uh New Yorkers access uh media or news through their language
community uh outlets the We Speak NYC um
and the MOYA English learning and support centers i see the executive plan includes um just about
$620,000 but that's compared to 1.1 million last year why was the budget for
we speaken NYC reduced um so for next fiscal year in FOY 26 um
we have uh secured in the executive plan about 600K as you mentioned we continue
to be in close collaboration uh in communication with uh OM uh to uh
continue to assess uh the needs uh and um and funding uh that is uh that will
be needed for but why was it reduced so much um again um the fiscal in fiscal 25
we were um happy to receive that additional funding from our partners at OM and we continue those conversations
with them uh as we get closer to the adopted plan i just think it's crazy that OM would be reducing your funding
at a moment like this
blink twice if you agree uh I what I will add is that the the funding that
you currently see reflected is the baseline funding for the program and uh
and we'll continue to work with our partners at OM but I mean do you think the the program is going to be
negatively impacted by that funding cut
uh we're in communications also with our partners uh we will be continuing our partnership with uh with the libraries
um and you know again uh with uh with OMB we hope to uh you know uh to to
continue those conversations for additional funding do you do you have a sense of how many participants attended the we speak NYC classes last year
um yes about 1,434 individuals and was there a
contingency plan or or for the folks that you served um who are attending
classes at shelters that might now be closed um and sorry uh chair I actually misspoke so and um because you said last
year so in 2024 about 5,152 individuals attended the classes
during our current uh calendar year from so from January through uh March 31st
2025 about 1434 individuals
so what about the folks who attended classes at shelters that that are now closed
can you repeat the question i'm sorry I missed that sure what was the backup plan to continue serving those who were
attending classes at shelters that are now closed migrant shelters so the so this so the classes that are being held
at shelters are run by our uh colleagues over at AASO um the focus of the classes
that they were providing were intermediate level um folks who have completed those classes are open to join
an intermediate level class at any uh NY uh New York public library site that's
participating in a program so a referral pathway is existing the beautiful thing about we speak is also that um
individuals have the ability to take classes on their own um and use the material that's existing on our website
which is also available to all the learners and chair if I can uh just to give you more sort of awareness about
the program about two years ago we decided to fund the New York City public library branches so that they can
provide these English classes across their their system so that we can connect newly arrived immigrants both in
the shelter system and in our immigrant communities with access to these classes prior to that classes were provided by
community- based organization on a voluntary basis and we thought that this would be a good way for us to spread
across uh better spread across these classes now uh you know with the
available funding we will continue this partnership with the New York Public Libraries and we hope to continue to add
resources to that um we'll talk a little bit about the
city's collaboration with the state the the state FY26 enacted budget includes a
little over $80 million for different immigrant related programs does MOYA ever collaborate with the state's office
of new Americans yes we're in in constant communication with our office of new American the state office of new
Americans in fact uh you know we we fund we contract with many of the same
providers including Catholic Charities that also uh oversees their hotline so
we have regular calls and we speak on a regular basis um you know again you know
um this is work that's important to both offices and we uh and we work very
closely with them okay
all right i'm going to turn it over to Chair Abilis uh chair if I may just to add to our uh your question on the
immigrant and ethnic media um work we've held eight roundts in the last uh fiscal
year in 2025 and our next round table will be on worker rights and immigrant communities
which uh will uh be looking to highlight the important rights that immigrants regardless of their immigration status
have uh and what to do as if they have been victims of workplace exploitation
thank you commissioner Chair Wilson been joined by Council Member Hudson
okay all right um so let's let's start with uh by talking about um the legal
support centers um so in fiscal 26 executive budget for Moya's legal support center includes 12.2 million for
action NYC aka legal support centers um 5
million for asylum seeker legal assistance network and 2.8 million for
the asylum seeker resource navigation center can you clarify what portion of
the 12.2 million for Action NYC is new funding versus baseline funding from the
previous fiscal
years so um the baseline funding for uh legal services is uh around
7.9 uh million dollars and uh the difference is uh digestional funding
that we're receiving in FY26 so the remaining
um six six mill and some is additional
onetime funding um well that's for um action um you know
for the uh for legal services uh at MOYA uh that's uh 7 7.9 so that um that's
that's the uh the number that that includes um the in terms of the the $12
million dollar that you're um asking about um in terms of legal services we
also uh got an additional um I think you're referring to the additional
funding that's reflected in 4.3 yeah I had to do the math now yes it's the four
uh yeah that that we got added uh in the exec plan that's that's one time funding
yes and that's coming from where omb uh is that coming from the AASO money
i would defer it to our colleagues um at OMB but that but that was added to our
You don't know where the money came from you're just happy to have it my Yes exactly but my understanding is that
it's it's not coming from the state funding that OASO received for this work
okay so of the of the 12.2 million how much is being distributed directly to
providers um so in FY26
um we have the the legal support centers
uh hold on give me one sec i can turn to my
chart um so in total for legal services
I think this will make a bit more sense uh for to talk about this
um for FY20 here we go
fy26 um the new 25 Moya legal support
centers will get uh 6 uh $6.3 million
about um that's what we have been
um budgeted for on top of that as the commissioner mentioned we will be
extending contracts for um some of the current
um legal providers under the former formerly known as action noy contracts
um and that will be about uh same $11.9
million i think um there's a bit of um um sort of to flesh out your numbers the
$12 million that you're talking about is what's added in the exec plan right um
so some of that funding that funding is a one-time uh funding that we have
gotten that includes um the 4.4 million that we received uh from from the
administration um the uh the formerly known as ASL uh which is fi the five uh
the $5 million uh in the uh for the in the funding for uh the program formerly
known as um as the navigation center i think that's what you were referring to
chair I'm sorry for the confusion no that's okay i'm I I have a couple different numbers floating around my
head so in terms of uh in terms of the legal support centers so
essentially despite all the changes in the contracts well it's the same amount of
money for the contract more or less from last year just a lot more organizations
right i mean it's more actually so you you said 6.3 million is going in fiscal
26 i have here fiscal 25 was 6.4 million correct so so it's going to be more uh
right so uh in FY26 uh MOYA is um is uh
consolidating programs right uh under uh the the Moya immigration centers right
uh and all available um you know and receive funding in FY26
uh will be added to that effort still through the baseline funding that we
have right can let me stop you for just a quick second i'm sorry i just want to make sure I'm
understanding because I I I feel like I keep hearing different things so of the
of the 12.2 million uh 6.3 million has been awarded for
fiscal 26 so I think let me go back a little i
think we were talking about So the 12 um the 12 million that you're talking about
that's that's the funding that has been added right in FY26 in the executive
plan that is not baseline funding that's additional funding that we have uh
received um as part of uh you know the executive plan so that's um you know
that's a one time um added funding that we've uh that we've received so you're
saying the 12.2 million is in addition to the 7.9 correct apologies for the
confusion okay so in still even then back to how much was um is going to be
distributed to providers so you noted 6.3 million for fiscal 26 which is less
than fiscal 25 so that's for the current uh contracts
for the I mean I'm sorry for the new contracts starting July 1st so that those are the new centers that will be
established uh on top of that uh we are extending um 13 of the current um legal
services contracts formerly known as as action NYC okay for one additional uh
fiscal year uh then that that will be about $12 million
for 13 uh of for 13 contracts so you're
going to extend 13 contracts for an additional year and then you're going to award an
additional 6.3 million for the new contracts uh that that and the new
contracts will start when July 1st
and can you provide the council with a list of providers and their funding allocations for this fiscal 20 uh 26
allocation that you've already made sure we can share that great thank you chair if I may add we're working towards as of
today uh having starting July 1st uh or
or in July 38 uh Moya legal support centers across New York City in um
neighborhoods where immigrant communities live
thank you Commissioner just um just for the record we want to make sure the 12.2 million that we were talking
about includes the 5 million from the Asylum Seeker Legal Assistance Network
and the 2.8 million from the Asylum Seeker Navigation Center correct okay
thank you okay right so starting in fiscal 26 programs like the Asylum
Seeker Legal Assistance Network and the resource we got to find shorter names
and the resource navigation center are inclusive of the legal support center um
why were these programs funding consolidated into a single budget and
will they still be run by the same providers so I guess it's an overlap of the last question
in part to address uh your last point uh to limit confusion as to where
immigrants can access services we want to provide the resources so that these centers house the nonprofits can provide
legal services and other services we're prioritizing of course legal services because that is what is in high demand
um Jess do you want to add to that um I'll start and then I'll pass it on to
uh my colleague Loren as well uh yes it's part of uh consolidating uh the
work um the work that has been done through the asylum seeker um assistance
network known as ASLAN um has been uh legal services that um that will be uh
folded into um the the services that are being provided by the these current
contracts um so it's uh you know and um we're also ensuring that uh we increase
the number of access points for immigration legal services for all immigrants right uh whether they're
recent arrivals or uh you know their um you know um have been here in the city
for many years or are also uh you know perhaps hold some sort of uh temporary
status but I'll pass it on to Lorena more yeah the only point I'll add is that um during the preliminary budget
hearing um over half of the public testimony focused on increasing legal services um so in a response but also in
a response to the need that we're seeing from folks from around uh we thought it this was the best approach to fold in to
to create additional touch points for legal services
yeah especially since we filed uh tens of thousands of asylum
applications to an office that is now closed with no information on what to do for those
folks so yeah we need it pretty bad um so in terms of the um how will MOYAY
ensure coordination and efficient utilization of resources to avoid duplication and services across uh the
legal support center NYC
so we of course work uh very collaboratively with the other agencies
that house immigration legal service uh programs like DSS HA OCJ in fact our
immigration legal hotline refers um u individuals to these services um and
we'll continue to work with them um individually and as part of our immigrant inter uh immigrant task force
that we coordinate inter agency task force that we coordinate got it and I'd like to recognize council member Brewer
and council member Botcha joined us um will will the ASLAN legal support
recipients contracts um end and are they being notified
um all of our contractors of our legal service contractors have received notification as of last week we are
scheduling follow-up calls with them um the idea here is to fold services um um
and we're we're going to be working with them in the next couple of weeks to figure that out with them together
when you say fold services can can you explain that um uh based on the last
statement you said in order for us to not duplicate services and to sort of streamline uh that's what I meant by
that got it thank you in terms of so the official start date for the new
contracts under the new legal support action
center i just totally merged the two names um that's what's happening in my
brain right now uh you you're going to give us were they all notified of their contracts or has
those determinations been made so all um current all current and uh new uh
vendors that will start July 1st have been notified with regards to the uh new
vendors that are starting on July 1st they're um they are working um closely
with our partners at DSS and they're they're working through their contracts um but more to come
and were there any uh providers that were previously funded under Action NYC
that did not receive contract renewals under this new model
uh in terms of um contract uh renewal uh extensions or renewals right there's the
extension and then there's the new model uh under for with regards to the
extension uh we had uh conversations with all uh current uh providers uh to
uh propose uh what that you know if they were interested in that extension uh all
but two um providers uh do not submit um
submit uh proposals uh so in terms of the current um pro illegal providers um
really just two of them didn't will not be extended for another year because
they were not interested in submitting that uh you know uh proposal um regards
to the new contracts um you know um again because we're still in the process
of these contracts being set up uh I can't go into uh you know list out uh
the current um selections but that will come uh in in the next couple of weeks
but are you aware so in terms of the extensions too that were not interested are you aware why they were not
interested uh we held uh you know multiple uh you
know uh reached out um we just uh do not do not hear back uh other than saying
that they were not interested at this at that point in time to submit uh extension uh an extension so they did
not inform Moya why they were not interested they ghosted you specific not ghosted us but they didn't go into
specifics okay um in terms of uh the renewals I so sorry in terms of the new
contracts um obviously there was an expansion in the numbers of um providers I think
commissioner you mentioned up to 25 in this new provider list uh essentially
the money hasn't increased in that pool are those contracts significantly smaller
so to clarify on the numbers of the baseline funding we'll establish 25
let's call them moya centers in the next fiscal year starting July 1st uh
together with the extension of contracts we'll have another 13 which amounts to
38 moya centers across New York City once we have that full list we'll be
publishing that online we'll make sure council members have that full list and
we'll let you know if any of these centers are located in your district so you're aware of services uh available
there so there's no overlap between the extensions and the providers the new
providers under the new contract there's no overlap there uh there will be some
overlap um and we will be sharing that uh in the next couple of weeks again so because some of these contracts are
still in the beginning in the process right that there will be some overlap i I I would imagine unless unless you
secretly grew providers overnight there has to be overlap there so that's what
we're we're interested in understanding um in terms of the
uh what were some of and I know we've discussed this before but certainly as
the new contract will take hold can you remind us for the record what some of
the primary reasons for changing into this new contract model was
partly is um to a um uh establish legal c moya
centers or providers within immigrant communities uh so that
uh residents can access these services in their own neighborhoods
um through providers that are most uh I think adequately
um established in these communities to provide culturally and linguistically
sensitive uh services
um yeah um I briefly add uh to that uh is you know um it's also to ensure that
um these uh new providers right um are also encouraged right to and we have we
will be working with them uh to build uh those uh connections and relationships
with uh other public institutions within those uh within their neighborhoods like schools libraries
uh as well uh to be able to uh to grow to grow their uh their network as well
but I'll let Lorena also add a bit more yeah and I'll add that um aside from the
language um excuse me the legal support centers there's also a legal technical mentorship component to it which was
meant um to very intentionally create a way uh to find support for legal
services for very niche matters um to some of these smaller uh nonprofits uh
but I just want to emphasize what the commissioner said um I think the idea here was to create a very hyperlocal
focus where uh legal service providers had brick and mortars that that folks could go to um
immigrant New Yorkers could go to within the five burrows
so are you saying under the last contract that that did not exist i'm I'm still trying to understand
what the differences are besides more providers
i'll I'll I'll let the commissioner expand but um I think the idea here is um that to create more um more touch
points really um in in ways that individuals from different neighborhoods
could come and and provide services i'll also say that needs have changed so the
types of legal service providers um who were needed to provide and respond to some of these changes was super
important in addition to that uh the idea really again to that mentorship program is capacity building like you
you mentioned sort of jokingly but re truthfully um you um the idea is to
create more um more legal service providers that can support um different ethnic enclaves and um sort of the idea
here is to build the capacity within within some of those new legal support centers that might have that capacity to
do so [Music] yeah I'd love I'd love to definitely
hear more about the the technical assistance component but certainly the needs once 100% have changed at least
people need full representation they don't need just a light proay anymore and you know with the changes in the
federal policies that existing cases are now much more complex
so just without changing much of anything the complexities that are needed within legal service provision
have significantly increased across the board without addressing even additional
new needs so so 100% and I just don't I guess I'd like to dive in later on about
like is is there real capacity building there because from what we're understanding what's happening on the
ground now is uh everybody is completely underwater and because of decreased
resources supervision structures are weakening people have too much case load
um and those have been and the service the amount of money that the city is offering to nonprofits is not sufficient
by any stretch of the imagination so it's still we still have this um real significant challenge in terms of how
many people and what demographic does the new model proposed to serve
so I I'll let um uh DC Sanchez or DC Lucero weigh in on
that but just wanted to add to the to the model what differentiates uh the
work of MOYA and uh the programs that are housed in other agencies is that the
this model increases the number of let's say touch points of immigrant communities to uh city funded programs
which is why we've decided to establish these 38 uh centers in immigrant
communities so that people know where to go to uh if they were to need uh
immigration legal services or other services i think that's been an effective model for us to be very much
rooted in community and districts and neighborhoods where immigrants live and
from there we'll connect them to city services available to them and to other providers
um and I think that's what we are doubling down in this new model and not
to say that we will uh cease to work with existing providers which again we
said we will be extending contracts for this next fiscal year u sorry chair can you repeat your
question at the top yeah we were somewhere else um what what um how many people does the
new model propose to serve um we're determining that number now um
because we're beginning the conversations with our contracted providers and I think the other part of
your question was demographic um also we'll circle back
and wondering if there is any distinction there uh from the prior model
once we finalize conversations and and um um finalize agreements with uh the
selected providers we'll be able to better assess that but our goal is to again spread the services across
immigrant neighborhoods in New York City uh and to pro provide as much linguistic
and cultural diversity amongst these providers yeah so so how does it look
for our home community what's the change that Sunset Park is going to see from
the old model versus the new model
um with we're again with um I can't really share the uh the list of
providers but there will be an overlap uh in terms of the services uh we are
looking to ensure that um you know we continue to have full coverage in all
five burrows espec especially in neighborhoods like uh like Sunset Park right uh where we have a large immigrant
community uh that we have uh centers uh either uh you know uh really close by
and or uh directly in uh in these neighborhoods so that uh folks can uh
can get these services with regards to uh the linguistic and cultural um uh
sensitivities right uh we were very intentional in this uh in this procurement to ensure that we continue
to prioritize that uh so you will see that also reflected in the in the providers and I I will just really uh
quickly add with regards to um to the new contracts of Saturday July
1 uh you know while there's overlap we also uh will see new um new v uh new
vendors right and this is part of building that capacity uh you know of uh
smaller CBOS and uh in being uh in community rooted organizations that are
providing this work as well in collaboration with uh with the new contract also that will be starting July
1st for legal technical mentorship for these uh new contracts so the ratio for
the new for the new um CBOS that you're trying to build capacity in what's
what's the staffing ratio we can share that uh in the coming weeks
as we're it's in the RFP wasn't it in the RFP the staffing ratios uh I don't
recall that from the top of my head but uh I think it was I just don't remember i think Yeah all so all of of course all
of the selected uh you know vendors um have met that right um So one of the
problems I don't know if you were able to solve this or you took it into account was that the staffing ratio was
inadequate for what the contract was hoping to achieve did you change at all the the
contract i know this has been a long long process was that ever addressed in the
contract was the staffing ratio improved because it from the former contract had
diminished quite a lot which goes against uh actually what needs to happen
so did you change the staffing ratios um in this final round if I can I'll
step in while Jess pulls that up um we did make significant amendments based on
feedback we received from you know uh the first uh versions of the RFX
and these amendments were made to you know uh make sure that there was
maximum flexibility for providers in including allowing them to and and Jess
can can weigh in allowing them to decide how they would staff their programs at
the amounts we we had um put the RFX out for which is
$250,000 per year for three years again
our preference is for our providers to be able to um decide how to best uh
staff their programs to meet those deliverables
got it and so currently do you does Moya have enough staffing capacity to to
manage the roll out of the programs or do you need additional staff lines to support these programmatic roles
we've of course always welcome additional staff we're you know we've made a number of adjustments within our
team to be able to best manage the roll out of these programs and provide
adequate oversight
i'm not even gonna do it um how many team members are currently dedicated to
policy work uh to immigrant services and what are their main priorities under the new
model uh for policy work we currently have uh three individuals focused on
that work will will they be working as part of the
new RFP model two of them will i'm sorry two two of the three two of the three
and what are their priorities under the model um well one will be working closely with
uh the legal service uh contractors providers um to to field and uh provide
support with the legal uh mentorship the technical component of it so we can pro
uh close work closely but also provide timely updates to our legal support
centers um and the other will be supporting with the legal support centers got it and has the uh has the
RFP made any accommodation for the increased complexity of existing cases
i'm going to say uh yes um the the contracts as they are provide more flexibility
um so folks can meet deliverables based on the needs that are emerging but again more to come as we finalize got it have
you requested additional headcount to expand Moya's team in in the near future to meet the demands of the legal support
center again we work closely with OM to determine this um you know we have an
existing uh headcount 63 staff we have how many
vacancies 13 vacancies 13 vacancies we're working to fill those up
um I think part of uh the reason we've established the technical assistance and
mentorship program was so that they can also provide adequate assistance uh uh
to the nonprofits that we're contracting uh which is why this this program is
essential to the work that we do
so you haven't you haven't requested additional staff from OMB you've you you're working on filling the 13
vacancies okay um so with the news of the nationwide blitz where ICE agents
are entering courouses to arrest immigrants and undermine due process now
um as we've seen in the Bronx what long-term strategy is Moya pursuing to
secure the resources that will be needed um in the years ahead to shore up and expand capacity
a lot of our work is focused on our inter agency coordination working across
uh agencies and offices so that we're in u close coordination and communications
um for instance um we understand that
our school system uh is um concerned about this weekend's
incident and uh one of our providers as was reported in the news stepped in to
support the individual and the family and we'll be working closely with the public school system and other agencies
in in in such a way so that we can um understand the needs on the ground in
the community as they occur so Commissioner um we saw just last week
many many ICE agents in the courts what what has Moya done in response to
this again it's essential for our immigrant communities uh to be well
informed of their rights uh and of the available uh services available to them
uh which is why we've doubled down on our communications efforts and wherever possible we are uh communicating
directly to them about about these rights and services uh that they should
know of uh as uh has Moya gone to the courts to offer that service or
direction to people who quite literally are being detained when they think they're getting a check-in or going for
any other court issue not the courts no yeah um okay um I'd like to acknowledge C
we've been joined by Council Member Hudson and Joseph sorry thank you um in
terms of uh the rapid re legal um the rapid response legal collaborative uh we
know that this program offers legal supports to individuals who are detained or at immediate risk of detention and
deportation particularly those who have not had uh or do not have the opportunity to appear before an
immigration judge um or are subject to expedited removals which we are seeing
happening quite uh a lot the executive plan includes 500,000 in fiscal year 26
for this program and the funding remains unchanged compared to last year's adoption in fiscal 25 the council
allocated an additional 1.2 million to three providers for this program can you
tell us um how many people this program served in fiscal 25
so before before Lorena answers this question you see Lucto answer this
question and just to clarify while Moya has not shown up to the courts or any of
the other sites our providers the nonprofits that we contract to work directly with the
immigrant community are in constant communication with their clients about
um any risk risks that they might uh face as they show up to court or to
their check-ins and so forth which is essential to do this work prior to uh
any instance that that they may be able that they may face non-local law
enforcement and possible action so yeah no the providers are underwater that's why we requested such an a significant
expansion of legal services support because the city is expecting the providers to do everything and then some
without sufficient support um so yes they are there but I would like to know
as a city agency who provides uh counsel and guidance to other city agencies how
are you engaged with court personnel if we see this continuing
um harm that is being done in the court system here so I was asking specifically
how Moya is engaging uh with the courts around this issue
um so can we get back to how many people the program served the rapid response
legal collaborative and FY25 um there were 88 screenings
and are there any weight lists for this program
i'm going to say yes yes do you know how many people are on weight list i don't but I can try to get that before the
hearing's up um when when the rapid response program
first launched uh it was shared as priority for city and state has the state continued to fund this program or
is it just fully funded with city dollars it's fully funded by city dollars
okay so given the flow of deportation cases has Moya formally requested
additional funding for the rapid response legal collaborative from OM
uh we continue to be in close conversations with them uh but did you ask them for additional funding for this
program in particular not in particular uh legal services
okay so in terms of um we're going to switch to unaccompanied minors uh the
number of accomp unaccompanied minors continues to increase um the absence of
clear sustained investment raises concern about the city's preparedness and long-term strategy for supporting
this vulnerable population is there any funding in fiscal 2026 budget to address
the needs of unaccompanied minors arriving in New York City or those who are facing immigration
courts um so I I don't have the number but I know that um I can say that we are
uh working with um IARE the coalition that supports um some of this population
to figure out a need um I also uh don't have the latest but I know that I care's
uh house at Department of Social Services i just don't have the number with me
so the the program was defunded I'm sure you're aware at $14 million
um several thousand children is Is the administration going to add any funding
for unaccompanied minors the cases haven't disappeared
they still sit with the providers with no money
so this is work that our colleagues at ACS oversee uh we're working closely with them and providers to see what if
the city can do with with um respect to this population we again we're also very
concerned about uh about the children that are left without services
did Moya ask OM specifically for funding for this program
moya didn't for unaccompanied minors moya did not ask for this as as uh for
this program as it's overseen by ACS uh I defer to them to answer this question
so you defer to ACS to do advocacy for unaccompanied minors no uh we've raised concern of
course about the um impact of providers and the children that are left without
uh legal services but again I defer to ACS to answer uh questions on their
program and how is how how is Moya then coordinating uh between the the agencies
in particular to support um the holistic well-being of unaccompanied minors are you gathering
ACS uh education housing are you doing any inter agency gathering specifically for
this vulnerable community that has been defunded by the federal government i know services uh with respect to youth
children families it's part of our ongoing conversations through our immigrant inter agency task force
um and again you know the programs that are specifically overseen by SCS and
other agencies uh they they request the funding or uh can say more about their
needs right Commissioner but but Moya's role
right is remind me what the role of Moya is for city agencies
yes again it's it's to help them uh help convene and coordinate across programs
but again I care is something that the office of civil justice overseas and uh
in collaboration with ACS and I defer to these agencies to to weigh in on their budgets okay so so have you convened and
coordinated on AC on unaccompanied minors and the situation we're currently in
um so Samoya has um spoken to both the Department of Social Services and ACS in
regards to some of the cuts that we were seeing federally in addition to also
speaking directly with uh folks from the IARE coalition
okay first of all I'm trying to get a sense of what is this action that is happening is it is are there meetings
are there actual requests for funding are what what is the level of action that is happening when we have seen a
straight defunding of some of the most vulnerable folks in immigrant
communities right children in particular so I I'm sorry I keep asking the question but I just want a very specific
answer either you didn't or you don't do it or you're in the process of it and this is what it looks like this is what
we're recommending or not recommending um so has the administration uh again
considered long-term strategies for unaccompanied minors who especially those who are aging out of use services
but still require support again you know this is an
ongoing issue uh and we're working uh uh with impacted agencies and providers to
figure out um what might come next
again the the gap left by the the funding of this program by the federal
government is is is vast and no one city can you know close the gap okay i'm
going to ask one more question and then I'm going to turn it over to colleagues i know you have places to go thank you for being here um uh really quickly so
in fiscal 26 we see that the funding for AASO was zeroed out um at the last well
I don't know if it's the last hearing um we understand that there were 27 positions that supported that office um
with funding considering um can you tell us what is happening
with all those 27 positions and resources
i can't speak to all of the 27 positions i know that some individuals have gone on to other agencies uh and offices we
are in ongoing conversation about if any will come to Moya but nothing concrete
yet
so you don't you don't know if any will be redeployed to Moya
we're in ongoing conversation but no we we don't know concretely
do you know what happens with all the case work that that was started on the OASO the f tens of thousands of cases
that they opened up for new arrivals
it with respect to legal services the uh the services provided were on a prosay
basis uh will be supporting uh those
individuals that need continued uh assistance through our our immigration
legal service programs and uh other programs across the city and how will
you provide that support we're referring individuals to uh
contact our hotline or uh any of our existing providers you know again this
is a an ongoing situation as the application help center winds down we'll
be getting information to to them as so that they can refer clients to us
will Moya be receiving all of the cent's infrastructure
no the application help center will be closing uh and um we as of now don't plan to subsume
any of those resources so just um um just for clarity sake I
did an application through the help center i'm now living somewhere helps
help center closes i'm supposed to know where to go
to open or check on my application or to get further support because I'm calling
the MOYA helpline that's that's the understanding with the tens of thousands of cases will find their way to Moya
they'll have our hotline available in existing services
um if they were to call the hotline they'll know you know that not not the
hotline the uh application help sell center that it is no longer active uh
and again when they were provided with those services uh the understanding was that
it was on a prosay basis not for ongoing legal support right the they folks did
understand that the city seem to have a problem with understanding the implications of that in the long term um
so we've learned through recent reporting that New York City plans to end case management uh that helps new
arrivals exit uh migrants shelters we understand that since 2023 approximately
100,000 folks were serviced through this case management program um services that
include finding legal aid jobs English classes with approximately 38,000
migrants still in our care uh can you tell us how many of them will um be
impacted by this cut in case management services
so to clarify both with with the services that you've mentioned and the application help center these these were
all funded by state resources which were not allocated for the next fiscal year
this is uh why those no longer will continue um and again many of these
programs were temporary as long as we had the resources to manage them uh
we'll continue to support uh people uh through our existing programs that we
fund uh as a city and uh just to note that those under our care are largely
individuals that arrived not recently so they would need a different set of uh
services right but there's still a significant amount uh with no real new dollars to
support the providers that are going to have to support this case load of work
right now okay um so next I'd like to call um
Oh sorry thanks thank you Chair we have questions now from Council Member Lewis
thank you chairs and good afternoon Commissioner Castro and to your whole team um had a lot of uh challenging
conversations with some of the groups in my district and parts of Brooklyn and uh hosted some mediations amongst them
because they feel that there's some contractual provisions that were unfair from your agency so I will ask you some
questions about that in hopes that we could get some clarity and further conversation so how is MoyÃ¡ ensuring
equity in the distribution of Haitian relief initiative and immigration legal service funding particularly as smaller
providers and CBOs have raised concerns that much of the funding is going to larger organizations like Catholic
Charities or with organizations with stronger ties with Moya like Life of Hope my second question is how is Moya
preparing to support Haitian TPS holders and West African migrants that are now
in portions of Brooklyn uh given the high risk of similar revocations and how
would the 1.7 million Haitian relief initiative baseline funding from H's
budget be coordinated to support humanitarian uh crisis support and my last one is in regards to uh your
testimony you mentioned that Moyer will be launching uh Moyer immigration legal support
centers about 25 of them and the numbers were all over the place regarding the 6.3 million but I wanted to know who are
the nonprofits that you all will be contracting with to provide this legal support um and what the what are the
metrics that you will utilize to identify those contractors those three questions
uh thank you council member um DC Sanchez will answer some of the
contract questions um but I'm happy that the Haitian response initiative in this
executive budget for fiscal year 26 will be baseline which allows us to then
discuss how the process to allocate the funds as a baseline project will look
like um I'll let uh DC Sanchez talk about the some of the other contractual
issues but again the the Moya centers that I
mentioned some of them are are funded through our baseline funds which will be 25 centers others will be funded uh
through one-year uh contracts that's what's going to get you to the 38 that's going to get us to 38 and will you
provide those locations and have conversations with us before that process starts and before the launch
happens well we'll provide the the list of um locations and the providers uh
very soon uh and have uh and make sure to let council members know if any of
them are located in their districts um because it's they're ongoing
contractual conversations uh I think uh DC Sanchez can can talk more about some
of the limitations to do with that but certainly we want to make sure to work closely with council members on this
thank you thank you so much for the question um so with regards to the new
uh Moya immigration lingo centers that will start in July um I'll start with
that um so that that process was through an RFX uh that was started nearly uh a
year ago so there's uh you know a process in place um what was the metrics that you used for that so there there's
a procurement process uh that is in place um like an RFP there's an RF yes
the it's an RFP that that went out uh this uh this whole process is currently
overseen by uh in collaboration with the department of social services where it'll be good to see what that looks
like what how the metrics is made up for the criteria for the RFP and because my
time is up I would like to know what support are you using for Haitian relief
and for the West Africans if all is that if all that is being bunched in together to support these two populations in the
midst of what we're going through in the midst of this crisis what does that look Like so uh really quickly um so all of
our um uh centers my immigration legal service uh centers are open to all
immigrants uh we do have folks that speak multiple languages and we do have
uh you know the centers do have uh language line available as well to support um and then with regards to the
Haitian response initiative this was uh an initiative that um that started back
in FY23 it has been year-to-year funding right uh this was uh a rapid response
that had to be put together um you know uh and it has been uh we have been
advocating for for this funding to be baseline right uh to be able to plan uh
to best plan long-term um you know thankfully uh as of next fiscal year FY26
uh that has been baseline for the outer year so now Moya is in a better position to plan uh to plan what the future of
that uh response initiative uh looks like right uh and to address some of the
concerns that have been uh brought up to you uh because so you actually understand the concerns instead instead
of internally trying to manage that on your own it's not an equitable process with who you have in place right now and
I was part of that movement that came together to make sure that this uh initiative was pushed through but it's
still not equitable till this day so it'd be good to have a conversation and meet with more than one member to have a
thorough conversation thank you chairs okay now we have questions from Council Member Hudson followed by Brewer
thank you so much i have um broader questions and then some specific to my
district but since January 2025 ICE has steadily increased its activity in our
city and providers continue to receive an uptick in reports of ICE arrests or attempted arrests in New York City we
know that ICE has picked up people at routine areas like near schools places of worship and many more what is the
administration messaging to those who fear deportation and no longer want followup with their doctor's appointments or are even willing to miss
school yeah I think it's important to communicate clearly with our immigrant
communities that um they're entitled to these services um as I did in my
testimony I made sure to communicate directly with immigrant communities i do so through immigrant and ethnic media on
a regular basis uh that said that there's a lot of confusion so it's important to to continue to repeat this
message and how does the administration propose to deliver services to detained and non-detained immigrants facing
deportation is there a continuation of of services
yes uh there will be continuation of services the services provided are
through our of course nonprofit contractors and they're allowable the
their contracts allow for this to occur the contracts allow for them to deliver services to both those who are detained
and non-detained immigrants facing deportation just to be clear yes okay
what need is there for additional resources and how much of an expansion do you think would adequately meet the
needs for immigration legal services as I shared in the last hearing the the
demand uh the demand for immigration legal services uh exceeds the need in our
communities especially as more communities uh need legal screenings and
support such as legal permanent residents so we're very much aware of that is there a number uh I said in the
last hearing we're we're we're speaking about over a million non-citizens that could use some type of immigration legal
service um over a million non-citizens but is there a a a financial number an
equivalent to that that would be useful to support those needs um advocates have
put this number at hundreds of millions of dollars again you know we we have uh
programs not just at MOYA but at other agencies that look to meet the needs of
the highest vulnerable populations but again uh as things change at the federal level more communities are of course
impacted okay thank you and then um three years ago the Hall Street complex opened in my district with almost no
advanced notice from this administration housing roughly 3,500 migrants with minimal support my office immediately
stepped up to serve both our new neighbors and longtime Clinton Hill residents we hosted a major town hall
with elected officials to address shelter capacity organized two May I continue chairs yes thank you organized
two resource fairs offering legal aid food and clothing we ran donation drives and delivered supplies directly to
families in need and we partnered with schools to enroll newly arrived children all without much help from the
administration looking ahead how does the Office of Immigrant Affairs plan to use its budget to better support both
the short and long-term needs of migrants coming to our city and do you believe there should be dedicated
funding and resources for migrant and refugee resettlement
well first of all thank you council member for the support you've provided to our immigrant communities um at Hol
Street and in your district this is one of the reasons one of the major reasons
why we've made changes to our model so that Moya centers are located in immigrant dense communities uh so that
we have better coordination uh in communication directly in the districts uh where immigrants live or where we've
uh you know temporarily housed them uh we're making uh we're learning from the
last several years and making adjustments uh again in terms of uh
resettlement programs it's hard to say um we provide
case management assistance for people to find their own housing within within New York City neighborhoods um but of course
affordability is is is a crisis that all New Yorkers have experienced right but I
just want to be clear do you believe there should be dedicated funding and resources for migrant and refugee
resettlement i want to be careful in how I answer
this question i I think you know um New York City should limit
um so migrant resettlement has been a
um an effort uh conducted by the federal government uh and immigrants should have
the choice to resettle or settle wherever they they think uh is appropriate um I'll leave it at there
okay thank you thank you chairs okay questions from Council Member Brewer followed by Joseph
thank you um my first question is I think for your workshops the ones that
are most successful in Manhattan are the ones at the restaurants are you doing those are those some of your restaurants
that get are the restaurants getting workshops the workers and the restaurants
so the priorities have been um and but also welcome an opportunity because we
have some pending workshops that are still available um through our immigrant rights collaborative our priority were
herks so phys at the physical herks um libraries as well as schools so as of
now we might have uh trained workers who work at restaurants but not physically at a restaurant okay but so you would be
open to doing workshops in restaurants that's where folks are so yes you would
be working to do that yes to to to fill the gap I need more than happy to
support uh workers okay we need that second I'm very um familiar with many of
the African young men because they're in my house and they're in my neighborhood and I'm up to here with them and my
question is health care so they all have NYC care they have no idea what to do with it some of their friends got
Medicaid a while ago not now obviously so I guess as my question is just
generally that's just a group I mean they don't know who they don't know who Taylor Swift is they're like in another
world and so my question is how do you communicate with them about these issues I can I'm doing the best I can but they
don't know where the to get health care they don't know they know to go to school they sort of know to get on the
bike and do the deliveries it's another world fani I'm learning fani i'm pretty good at it right now so my question is
how do you communicate with a group like this and how do you tell them how to get health care etc who does that
well thank you council member for for your work uh this is why our work with uh community based organizations is
important that said to get to scale we have to work with health and hospitals
and in our health care system overall which is why we held the immigrant media roundt couple of months ago uh so that
we can get this information out through uh news outlets uh that they read uh in
their own languages again it's it's challenging uh because a lot of these
languages are what we term languages of limited diffusion so we have to find every which way to get to them okay and
then the other question I have is just in terms of those that leave the shelters obviously the row and the
Roosevelt in terms of those families are closing in June so is that the responsibility of H&H case workers or
your case workers how does that information get transferred as to where they're going what their questions are
etc there are a lot of families in both of those hotels yeah I know case workers
at H&H are working very hard in the next several weeks to make sure that people
get information that they need those who are transferring to the department of uh homeless services uh should also get
information through that agency okay so you think that that's enough that they'll be able to handle that and then
what happens you don't know to the H&H case workers do they go to health and do they go to DHS or they have contracts
that end or we don't know yes uh their contracts are ending uh they've been
informed many of them are uh transferring to other agencies or other work it would seem to me that they would
be helpful because they're so knowledgeable about some of these cases is that something that somebody's paying attention to
yes they would be uh great additions to any team because they know the work on
the ground with these communities okay um just finally also we work a lot every
day with CUNI in terms of their support is that an organization that you fund or do they get their funding elsewhere
cutuney citizenship yes we fund uh Kuni citizenship now okay and they are um
funded to do the actual uh case work for people getting asylum or immigration or
green card etc is that correct uh correct they partly uh have funding from
us but also uh other uh funders okay do you have some senses generally how much
federal dollars totally when we had the cultural groups here they actually gave a number um from cultural affairs of 23
million as to what was cut from the cultural groups do you have some sense of what has been cut for immigration
from the god awful federal people um as was mentioned earlier it's in the tens
of millions i mean it it's an ongoing situation so it it's it's quite significant okay is that something down
the line you could give us a number we can make an analysis yes okay that would be helpful thank you have questions from
council member Joseph followed by Salam thank you chairs um a couple of
questions commissioner how are you um about that New York City student that they detained in ICE what kind of
support are you providing for the family and um when young people are going to court and that's what the chair was
referencing unaccompanied minors as well but unc accompanied minors as well what kind of support is Moya providing for
young people uh thank you thank you u council member um because of the
sensitivity of uh particular individual cases we don't often share specifics but
as was reported um in in through the media one of our
providers Nyl stepped in and is supporting uh the individual in the family we're very proud of the work that
our providers do in this respect generally speaking uh if if any individual or family uh need support um
they can call our hotline or reach out to any of our providers to see how we
can help and then often we we also get informed on our end is those pro is those um providers listed somewhere that
families know where to go to are they also provided to New York City public school students or families or immigrant
centers because I know this is one of our very case but from this case we can learn how to better support New York
City public school students who will face ICE yes we have a list of our existing providers which again you know
that will grow and we're working to to roll out a new version of that list as as more as Moya centers are added but
yes all of our agencies uh have this list available to them we also have an
extensive directory on our website that uh people can can use it's a mix of uh
organizations that we contract with and and and don't but that's available to them as well thank you um wanted to
circle back to and talk about we speak NYC i know that's a that's a program I used widely when I was teaching is that
in partnership with D79
no this is this is a um a program that is run uh solely by Moya solely by Moya
but in the executive plan you only have 617,000 compared to the 1.1 million that
was added last year so why was the budget reduced by 615 in the fiscal 2026
compared to 2025 in the adopted bud budget is it due to the closures of the
herk centers as well does that play a role in that uh no that that's an independent program
uh you know we still are in uh close conversations with OM about uh the the
opportunity and potential to add additional funding to this program uh in next fiscal year uh the the uh
$617,000 that you see uh reflected in FY26 as the baseline funding and uh
we'll continue to work with OM to If you need to expand you will chair can I And if I may add council member to your
question regarding D79 we do work with them to um encourage them to send students to one of our many um um sites
within the library system was that um funding the 630 was that repurposed to
immigrant rights collaborative in FY25 since the program will not continue was not continued in fiscal 2026 how were
those funds reallocated or absorbed um so that funding for um that was in
FY25 um you know due to the um high need that we saw uh in you know at the end of uh
2024 uh leading up to um you know uh to inauguration uh there was a high demand
uh with regards to know your rights right uh so given uh the limited funding
that we had uh we uh made a decision to pivot that funding and uh and fund
additional know your rights uh workshops with uh current providers as well as uh
you know uh do a large print of materials um uh that have been developed by our
office in our uh uh public uh in our website uh to be able to print those out for uh contracted Moya vendors and uh
and also for uh council offices as well do you have a number of how many folks attended this um we speak NYC classes
last year yes in um uh calendar year 2024 uh about uh the numbers the exact
number is 5,152 um and currently from January 1st 2025
through March 31st 2025 1,434
why the drop in numbers it's mostly because we haven't completed the calendar year so it's only until March
okay do you have a breakdown of locations burrow sites and um and why is
the Bronx the most underserved in the six locations that you have i do have a breakdown so currently um
for FY25 there's a total of 179 classes
72 were in Brooklyn 69 in Queens 10 in the Bronx 26 in Manhattan and uh two in
Staten Island um the makeup um is really determined in collaboration with the library systems um so that's sort of the
reason but we'll be more than happy to sort of look into that as well that would be great um and we speaks NYC is
still successful in terms of attracting new participant what are the criterias you use to measure success and that
would be all chairs what do you use to measure success
well I think for us um as you know with this this is really the entry point to
just languish services period so for example like my mom who might be shy to speak English in front of people this is
sort of the place where you get the very beginning fundamentals so for us um
metrics wise is the number of classes that you're attending um but also um the
ways that we are capturing some of the information so that's part of it but again for us it's really um encouraging
learners to continue their their journey with inter intermediate level classes and so forth is there an exit um survey
that folks take in order to say how well this is working or it's not yes I'm going to say yes um I just don't
have the number handy but but overall anecdotally folks have said that it's been helpful in encouraging them to
continue their their adult learning classes thank you chairs and can I if if I can council member just to clarify so
uh we have baseline funding for for this program and then throughout the year we often get additional funds added uh to
Moya's budget which we then invest in in these various programs not ideal for our
providers and we hear them you know but we are very committed to working closely with them so that they know right that
this may come thank you commissioner thank you chairs questions from council
member Salam thank you and good afternoon um I have a
question [Music] um about the immigration legal services
and the federal funding cuts fiscal year 26 executive budget includes only $4.4
million for immigration and legal services which falls far short of the $190 million requested by the city
council how does Moya plan to sustain critical legal programs given this shortfall especially in light of the
recent $200 million in federal cuts that have already disrupted services for over
1,000 open cases in New York City
thank you for the question council member um the the funds available to
Moya for immigration legal services are are not the only funds available for this work uh other agencies also um have
available funds uh for for these needs um do you have the total number Jess
um yes um I can uh also add that uh on top of the 4.4 4 million that you see in
the executive budget uh there were a couple of other items added um
$165 million for the Haitian response initiative um $5 million uh for the
program formerly known as ASL and $2.8 million uh for the program formerly
known as navigation centers um in uh in the executive plan for the total
the entire sorry and for the entire um city budget
we have I believe hold me one sec to pull up the number
uh for the city budget um the total immigration legal services investment
citywide is $42.6 6 million and what is Moya's contingency plan for
the 200 plus impacted legal service staff and pending minor asylum cases if
additional city support is not secured
i'm sorry council member could could you repeat the question sure what is Moyer's contingency plan
for the 200 plus impacted legal service staff and pending minor asylum cases if
city support is not secured additional city support oh I see the um
the application help center you know again you know the we've expressed our
disappointment that the state funding is not available to continue those services and the application help center will be
uh closed by the end of the fiscal year uh as I stated before um clients will be
connected or potential clients will be connected to our existing programs including Moyes uh and staff are um are
finding um new employment at at other agencies and within our nonprofit
sector and chairs i just have one last followup dealing with mental health
services for immigrants and asylum seekers immigrant communities particularly asylum seekers face unique
mental health challenges yet the executive budget lacks dedicated traumainformed mental health funding
what steps will the will Moya take to address this gap and expand culturally
competent mental health support and has Moya coordinated with
DOMH and or H&H to develop a joint strategy to deliver mental health
services tailored to undocumented and recently arrived populations as I've been working closely
with the commissioner of the department of uh health and mental hygiene um in
recent months uh we're planning to launch uh an outreach campaign for this summer specifically for these reasons uh
both the commissioner and I will be uh deploying staff and ourselves going into
immigrant communities to uh ensure that that immigrant uh uh New Yorkers know of
our existing resources we're also working closely with the uh mayor's office of community mental health uh to
continue to inform um our residents it's it's a priority for us which is why the
commissioner and I will be working on this joint pro project this summer thank you
thanks chair so in in in the vein of uh mental health
and just healthc care services in general are there any new specific investments that are being made in
fiscal 26 i'd have to defer to DOH and the mayor's
office of committee mental health uh on on questions related to the budget i
don't know honestly of any new investments uh but we we uh do play a
role in ensuring immigrants know about existing resources including their
hotlines and again this is this is uh going to be a priority of ours this summer as we launch this outreach
campaign
in terms of um in terms of the federal the federal government right now um in
this reconciliation bill we see provisions to penalize states that use
state only funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants by cutting their federal Medicaid funding how do
you see this potentially affecting New York City and New York State's healthc care initiatives to undocumented
communities yes it's it's something that I know that is of concern to our our health and
hospitals and the OMH uh leadership uh
we're looking at uh potential uh impacts on our communities and um again we can't
speculate about what may or may not happen but we'll we'll be ready to respond uh when the time comes
in terms of um given that New York State has historically taken steps to expand
access to health care for all residents regardless of immigration status do you foresee the proposed
um federal penalties forcing the state and city to roll back any of these
programs uh we frankly don't know though the city
um has been strong advocates of of expanding health care to all its
residents uh in that you know we have the adequate resources to be able to meet those needs
and in terms of how does uh Moya's plan to advocate at the state or federal
level against these policies um could harm immigrant access to health
care such as the provision in the budget reconciliation bill i'm sorry if that didn't make any sense but how do you
plan to advocate at the state or federal level against these policies yes we're
in close contact with our colleagues at the OMH again you know working very closely with the uh interimm uh
commissioner there to uh to bring our our teams together and think about these things uh as as we hear of any changes
uh or any impact we'll be uh able to respond together have you have you made
any public statements about about how harmful this reconciliation bill will be
to immigrant communities uh we have not but uh both or our three offices
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Health and Hospitals and Moya put out a letter uh com directly communicating to
our immigrant communities about our existing our ongoing commitment to our communities regardless of their status
i'm sorry did you say you wrote a letter to immigrant community members about the harms they're experiencing no we wrote a
letter um emphasizing our commitment to their care and emphasizing that they can
continue to access city services regardless of their status got it and then well in terms of if you haven't
made any public statements have you made private statements to state to our state
partners about the harm of this have you made any statements to to our federal
part who's left as federal partners about the harm of this uh we have not
that is uh up to our intergovernmental affairs office although we did put out
uh with the department of health and mental hygiene an oped um emphasizing
the importance of healthc care programs to our immigrant communities
has Moya explored partnerships with ethnic media to ensure that critical messages are reaching immigrant New
Yorkers in their native language particularly about the harms that are being proposed in this bill
specifically about this about this bill no although as I said earlier um our
partnership with immigrant and ethnic media is is very important which is why we hold these ongoing roundts
um about a month and a half ago we held one dedicated to healthc care and we'll
continue to hold these uh moving
forward in fiscal 20 the how does the fiscal 26 executive budget ensure
continued or expanded access to health care for undocumented and un and
uninsured immigrants in New York City i don't have specific uh details on the
on the budget um question i'll have to defer to my colleagues at the OMH and
H&H for that have you recommended any specific
funding levels to ensure uh health care for undocumented and or uninsured
immigrants in New York City to your colleagues again we have ongoing
conversations with our colleagues we uh defer any funding requests to them as as
they oversee the but have you made any recommendations is my question specifically moya no
okay so does the executive uh fiscal 2026 executive plan include any
resources for improving language access in health related services for immigrants who speak limited English or
indigenous languages for health specific language access not
sure if we have that information in front of us although we do uh coordinate language access across the city and we
have ongoing conversations with all of agencies including the OMH and H&H on
this matter in in has Moya engaged with the NYPD on
their recent policy change given um uh bicycle riders criminal citations
no is Moya aware of the policy of NYPD
giving uh bicycle riders and ebike um folks who violate traffic violations
criminal summones we're aware but have not engaged no
do you think it would be helpful for Moya to provide recommendations to the NYPD around the immigrant
implications of providing criminal summones for traffic violations rather than civil summones which is what they
did before much of these conversations will occur as we hold conversations through our
immigrant inter agency task force so when Moya is when did Moya become
aware of this policy change
i don't have the the exact date uh chair
perhaps when it was in the newspaper when we all became aware of it is quite
possibly but I guess now that you know that it is happening has Moya affirmatively reached out to the NYPD to
say this is bad for immigrant community members who rely on this mode of transportation to single them out and
unfairly provide a a criminal summon which could trigger federal immigration detention and
deportation knowing that this policy passed has Moya affirmatively reached out to say this is wrong thing to do
this is not a specific conversation we've had with the NYPD does Moya think it should have this
conversation with the NYPD these topics are often uh issues that
come up during our inter agency task force
meetings also um has Moya been keeping track of um I
think to her earlier point in the courts has Mullya been keeping track of ICE
engagement in the courts at all as as much as others you
know um you know as much as you know we uh
hear of reports again there's little ways we can know about these uh
instances ourself because we're not in any way co coordinating with with uh
non-local law enforcement right but Moya is Moya keeping track of any ICE engagement across the city at all
yes but again we uh it's hard for us to keep track because we don't know of this
information and we can't verify this information um just like most people who
are tracking this has Moya ever considered the potential
of being a place where you should track that kind of activity that could help
with both providers and residents engaged it would be very difficult for us to to
do that
okay okay just I I think we've um we've certainly belabored the point but um as
as you are aware um the council requested uh $ 109
million increase for the immigration legal services um enhancement and was
only granted $4.4 million do you think 4.4 4 million addition is sufficient to address the
current need uh like I I shared earlier the demand
um ex exceeds the need um in DC Sanchez described the total amount that the city
allocated for this again it's not just toya but other agencies as well if DC
you want to add to that uh no uh the only thing that I will add
uh that in the executive plan uh there was a a total of $42.6 million um added
to the city's um uh executive plan for uh immigration legal services
and tell give me the breakdown of where that's going to the 42.6 six that uh I
will have to get back to you i don't have that specific breakdown other than just just Moya's uh portion uh which is
the 12.2 million that we discussed earlier
great okay we're almost wrapping up here in terms of um budget and staffing um
you mentioned earlier that you currently have 13 uh vacancies um when we last met
you mentioned you had 11 11 vacancies so you have increased are you having
challenges uh getting lines
hired um well currently unfortunately uh since the last time that uh that we were
here uh we had a couple of attritions added uh so that's why uh we have now
more vacancies uh now we also have um now five candidates that are in the
pipeline um that are still uh that are moving through the uh approval uh and uh
on boarding process uh last time it was for um so that's that's sort of what uh
we're currently um are at and we're continue to work with uh you know OM for
uh to get those uh to get those approvals um and yeah and we're also uh
posting um some of these uh some of these vacancies uh currently two
positions are posted and a few more um will come online in the next couple of weeks so the five candidates you have
are for the two posted positions or they're for other positions for other positions okay and how long is it taking
how long have those candidates been in the pipeline for um it varies um some of
them have been there for almost uh a little over a month uh the re uh
recently uh others have been there um you know between uh you know uh six or
or more or six to eight months at at the very least wow that is a lot um so have
you experienced to your awareness um candidates that have withdrawn because
of that lengthy hiring six to eight months to get hired is enormously long
time um currently uh we're very uh thankful and lucky that uh all of the uh
candidates are still very interested holding on uh holding on again um you
know this is on a case-byase basis uh and you know in terms of the onboarding
process um and again we continue to work very closely with our partners at OMB and and uh you know to be able to get
those approvals do you know why it's taking so long six to eight months
or waiting they're still waiting it could take effectively longer than that you have any awareness what that what
that what's contributing to that length i do not have specifics unfortunately
is this typical have you seen this before is this kind of what it is
it it depends right uh I mean to to be on boarded to the city on average uh you
know it takes a few months uh so um yeah but yeah we continue to work with OM and
other folks to uh to get these folks on board as soon as possible
right so um currently Moya staffing structure is you have five in your in your agency and then everybody
else is in different agencies uh correct uh we have
uh sorry uh yes five lines under the mayor's office uh and then the the
remainder are split between uh the department of social services as well as
uh DAS and are the vacancies are they
concentrated on one or the other are they across both Dcasts and DSS both uh
DAS and DSS it's a bit of a Got it and you don't know to this point
whether or not you're going to absorb any of Aasel's staff not yet
okay with budget yeah I think so of course
all right I think we're good okay thank you all very much thank you chairs just
just lastly want to express my gratitude to both of you for convening this this hearing and to all our council members

okay whoever would like to start I will start go ahead good afternoon greetings Council Member
Brennan and Council Member Allis and the members of the Finance and Immigration Committees my name is Mon'nique Francis
and I'm here as the interim executive director of CUNI Citizenship now I'm
here to you I'm here before you today on behalf of the 55 city council funded
employees advocating for continued funding for an organization that is making the difference and empowering
immigrant immigrants at a time in our history when the people who built this nation are pe are being treated in a
cruel and inhumane way this moment calls out for bold leadership fearless
advocacy and the resources to ensure that every immigrant in New York City has access to free highquality legal
assistance after the 2024 presidential elections we saw the need to marshall a
quick response and took proactive steps to alert all of our networks our first
call to action was to submit applications for benefits under the outgoing administration existing
policies before the new changes were enacted we urged green card holders to apply for citizenship or to apply to
renew their status we encouraged those with work authorization and other documents that were expiring to new to
renew well in advance of the expiration date we preparedformational materials and addressed the anticipated changes to
immigration policies and advised non-citizens on proactive steps that they needed to take in advance of
January 20th following Jan the January 21st onslaught of executive orders
targeting asylum seekers paroleies and undocumented migrants our next call to action was to
offer know your rights and family preparedness educational sessions to community we quickly saw the need to
conduct these sessions via closed Zoom webinars to pro protect those seeking
information and to ensure that everyone could listen in the privacy of their homes to date we have completed more
than 30 know your rights sessions educated thousands of immigrants and provided information that is crucial
during this period to combat misinformation in the often circulate that is often circulated on social media
we prov we found a variety of channels to share accurate immigration updates we created a web page to highlight and
explain the policy changes from DHS and USCIS we sent emails to you and members
of your staff and alerted all of our list serves we also have a weekly reoccurring announcement in the Qun
newsletter which is distributed to more than 550,000 subscribers individuals affected
by these policy changes desperately seeks our help between January and April
our contact center system received more than 21,000 unique phone calls texts uh
text messages and call back requests this was a 30% increase in volume since November 2024 we made every effort to
pri prioritize those who are calling to verify what they were seeing and hearing
in the news for urgent inquiries we assigned an on call attorney to respond our team has been working tirelessly
with every group that has been targeted and closely monitoring every lawsuit filed to counter unlawful termination or
revocation of status we're offering virtual appointments to those who request them our leave staff holds case
discussion and case updates twice per week to ensure that everyone on the team has accurate and up-to-date information
to share with constituents the demand for our services has never been greater which is something which we anticipated
what we did not foresee was the targeting of lawful permanent residents such as green card holders and
international students under the new administration there's been an increase in deportations carried out by ICE
creating fear and uncertainty within the community because ICE officials have been largely targeting
undocumenting have been unable to locate undocumented migrants with violent
criminal records they've shifted their enforcement efforts to those who are lawfully in the United States using
pressure tactics to encourage self deportations to meet their deportation quota many immigrants are finding
themselves in hiring situations unsure of their options Kuni Citizenship Now is
providing support they need to make informed decisions about their immigration posture the reality is that
for many of us United States is our home we came here for a better life and will remain regardless of who is president
while the demand for our services continue to grow exponentially our funding will not allow us to meet these
increased needs we're seeking $5 million in funding for fiscal year 2026 which is
a restoration of the 3.1 that we currently get and an enhancement to 1.9
million council members have asked us to increase our citizenship days throughout the cities and we are prepared to do so
but we need those resources funding will allow program to expand by providing extra days of service at the council
member offices and creating a more robust attorney triage hotline since our funding in 1997 Citizenship Now has
become a beacon of hope to New York City and we're committed to continuing to serve frontline providers serve as
frontline providers over the next four years and beyond we urge you to maintain and increase support funding for our
services and for our program thank you for your time and consideration i look forward to answering your questions
thank you good afternoon uh chair Justin Brandon
and uh chair ais for immigration i am Carmen Deleon i am the president of
local 768 i represent the New York City healthc care employees i am also a vice
president to the executive board of DC37 i am here today on behalf of my members who work at correctional health they are
licensed creative arts therapists who provide therapy in group settings as well as the social workers who work at
Riker's Island on behalf of those that are incarcerated providing anything from
mental health therapy to advocacy and negotiations from within the uh jail
house itself to the uh lawyers making connections when they need them i am
here today because my concern of myself and my members is in regard to their safety uh while working at Riker uh
specifically for correctional health uh recently there was a workplace violence
committee meeting from H&H with regard to correctional health
they reported that there were in fiscal year 2024 there were 249 assaults
varying from a member being spat on to actual physical assaults i am here to
say that those are very numbers are very much under reppresented they don't report and my members in particular I
can speak to are encouraged not to report the violence or any physical
assaults they have been told "Well you just got punched in the eye but you don't have a black eye and you'll be
able to recover and come back." That is an actual story from some of my members
um as well as bodily fluids being thrown at uh those that are employed in
correctional health that is usually one of the most uh prevalent ways of
assaulting someone um so as we move forward I am asking the city council to
keep up their diligence in uh regard to correctional uh dom I mean sorry
department of correctional as we go to move towards to uh community-based jails
there is adequate understaffing as it stands right now and I can't imagine that 300 3,300 beds is going to be
enough to service the incarcerated population as well as provide them out
quate services thank you for your time today and I look forward to next year thank you
thank you so much for your testimony um I just I want to ask you a question Monique um first thank you obviously for
both of you for your different services of your constituencies i know city
relies heavily and certainly my office does on citizenship now's work um across
the city can you tell me I mean you in your testimony you clearly noted the increase and in one in one place you
actually said 30% increase in cases um from your perspective has what you just
heard the city testify have you have you heard do the changes that are being
proposed and or the modest increases of funding how do you think this is going
to impact the work that you you're doing right now um so we just lost funding
from Moya uh we received our notice last week that they're cutting the ASLAND funding that they give to us so I'm not
sure how to respond to your question on what the changes will be but but even in
terms of how about in terms of the question of the complexity of cases I think one thing you noted was I think
many people didn't realize was that this administration would certainly even target green card holders among others
we knew they were just going to target everyone um how has that impacted the level of
service that you are able to provide well the work that we do is primarily
prosay but while we say it's prosay folks still keep on coming back to us because we're there we've been here for
28 years so even though they get the we're not your attorneys we can only help you up to a certain point they
still come back asking us questions we still have to be the support they need and that's one of the differences
between what we do and what other programs in the city does
thank you i think I think what I'm hearing is and what I saw just a few
minutes ago is they're still cutting programs and patting themselves on the back for adding money somewhere else um
thank you for the work that you do you're welcome council member Brewer has a question i just want to say the same
thing thank you both but I have to say my office Citizenship Now at CUNI is our go-to place you are streamlined you are
responsive everybody gets service and I just want to say thank you you're welcome
please add my name to that pile as well okay thank you i'll see you on June 7 yeah right on i appreciate you guys
thank you okay okay our next panel we have Deborah Lee Katherine
Gonzalez Carla Astellaza Jodie
Zismer Luis Maneno Ernie
Colette and Sophie Dalzyr
okay you want to start from the my right your left just hit just hit the button on there
you go hi uh good afternoon my I'm Carlos Salasa i'm the managing director
of the immigration practice at the Bronx Defenders and thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today this
council's leadership and vision made possible the launching of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project 12 years
ago ensuring universal access to representation for detained immigrant New Yorkers together with Brooklyn
Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society we're requesting 11.06 million for each organization double our current
budget to ensure we have resources proportional to the mass detention and deportation campaign we are fighting
against since January we have witnessed a staggering increase in detentions a trend that will continue to escalate
given the recent opening of the Dellay detentions uh facility in Newark with
1,000 bed capacity as well as the new detention space in Nassau County our recent clients include long-term green
card holders detained at JFK undocumented parents and spouses of US citizens swept up in home rates and
asylum seekers detained at ICE check-ins in front of their children while doing exactly what our government asked them
to do our knifob staff has also stepped up to defend New Yorkers against new and expanded uses of federal law we're
litigating against implementation of the Alien Enemies Act which targeted hundreds of Venezuelans for renditioning
to notorious prisons in El Salvador we're challenging attempts to use expedited removal to deport New Yorkers
without due process and we're fighting back against active attempts by ICE to bring back deportation cases of knifup
clients which have been closed for nearly a decade we urged this council to act now to ensure we have the resources
to continue fighting back access to knif representation increases detained immigrants chances of success by more
than a thousand% we also lowered the social and economic cost of homelessness foster care and unemployment created by
immigration detentions and avoidable deportations we have represented thousands of detaining New Yorkers and
have the expertise and to train new advocates and build capacity to meet these moments with the council support
thank [Music] you good afternoon my name is Katherine
Gonzalez i'm a supervising attorney and policy council at Brooklyn Defender Services one of the knifeup providers
here in New York City thank you for the opportunity to testify today now more than ever New York City's knife up
program is needed to meet this unprecedented moment i want to highlight the ways in which the recent federal
policies and practices have affected clients represented by the KnifeUp program and why our advocacy is needed
today knifup serves New York immigrant communities in complex immigration matters in a rapidly changing legal
immigration landscape this complex nature of clients cases requires extensive preparation and resources the
current federal immigration reinforcement policies have a range of serious consequences for New Yorkers our
offices have continued to represent people whether detained locally or transferred across the country which
we're seeing more and more um with the Supreme Court allowing the administration to end TPS for example
more of our previously protected clients with families and lives here in New York will be detained and are being detained
by ICE with the weaponizing of war powers against immigrants through the alien enemies act people who we
represent are being threatened with removal to seek caught in El Salvador and other third countries with no due
process and this change has necessitated the filing of emergency federal litigation to prevent the unlawful
rendition and disappearance of immigrant New Yorkers and removal proceedings after the Supreme Court case we expect
to litigate on an expedited basis more individuals habius petitions to
challenge the use of the Alien Enemies Acts against our clients and not just clients from Venezuela but other
nationalities targeted by recent State Department uh designations including people from Central America and Haiti
when IRS immigrants prior to the resolution of their pending local cases here in New York it is infringing upon
their ability to participate in their local non-immigration court proceedings pending here in New York funding Knifup
supports New Yorkers ability to exercise due process in local proceedings here in New York including housing family and
criminal court thank you so much my name is Deborah Lee and I'm the
attorney in charge of the immigration law unit the legal aid society thank you to the committees on immigration and finance for this opportunity and your
ongoing support i'm testifying in coalition with the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project partners um but as
well um also the immigrant opportunities initiative contractors we are now 127
days into this presidential administration and its priority is to detain and deport as many people as it
can this federal government is trying to funnel more non-citizens towards removal orders or otherwise ready them for
immediate deportation in the past month the Department of Homeland Security began requesting that the Immigration
Court recaler thousands of previously administratively closed cases nationwide additionally ICE is now detaining
non-citizens at immigration court targeting them for uh targeting those who are complying with our immigration
laws and trying to have their day in court how can we fight against this onslaught we must take bold stands like
this council's fight to keep ICE out of Rikers we stand with you and will not be complicit in sending more into this
federal government's deportation machine overall in addition to continued and additional support we need flexibility
in our contracts we are eager to do all we can to defend non-citizen New Yorkers but also win our contracts to appreciate
that immigration detention may continue to expand and immigration court cases require constant but prolonged
dedication critically we need more knifeup funding we are the city's and state's experts in defending against
imminent removal but must have resources to meet the complex reality of detained deportation defense our knife up clients
are now fighting in immigration court but also in federal courts against unlawful removals under the Alien
Enemies Act and to third countries legal aid is asking for 11.06 million for each NIFA provider for II funding we must
prioritize legal representation in immigration court this is the most pressing need of non-citizen New Yorker
that non-citizen New Yorkers face and our funding must reflect that i do also want to clarify Moya's testimony
regarding a continuum of services that is not accurate we do not have a continuum of services for somebody who
is not detained and suddenly becomes detained legal aid is also asking for 1.75 million for our UMF5 funding and
continued funding for our low-wage worker initiative finally we ask that all funding reflects our full staffing
needs and costs as our staff are our frontline responders in these tumultuous times and we must be able to provide for
them thank you for this opportunity thank you my name is Jody Zemer i'm
testifying on behalf of the New York Legal Assistance Group or NYAG our city has repeatedly noted its commitment to
our immigrant communities legal service funding is essential to preserve the rights of immigrants and keep families
from the harm of detainment deportation and more we call for additional dollars
to be allocated to the city budget for these services increased investment that supports innovative and flexible legal
service programming to respond to the ongoing and emergent needs of our communities will give immigrant New
Yorkers a chance to live work and thrive in our city as noted by this committee
response to emergency enforcement action as we've seen when ICE comes into our immigration courts and detains
respondents when ICE arrests students at our city colleges and ch and the need to
challenge deportation to third countries and to preserve due process in the deportation process requires flexible
and robust funding including programming such as the rapid response legal
collaborative and the immigrant opportunities initiative the II collaborative um I will note that this
budget of fiscal year 26 does not restore the $600,000 in cuts from fiscal year 25 to
the rapid response legal collaborative we are the organizations that have responded to taking cases for immigrant
New Yorkers who are being detained and deported rapidly we are collaborating on
both a local and national level to supplement some of the NEFA funding and programming as well as um provide
emergency flexible legal response to the enforcement actions that um are coming
at a very rapid pace we also do track and report back to MOYA about
enforcement actions so that is something that again we ask for restoration of that funding in order to continue those
essential services
uh my name is Luis Manenno and I am the citywide director of legal services New York City i am speaking today on behalf
of my organization which is one of the organizations that is constructed to provide legal services under the IOI
contract i was as I was walking here today I was thinking about exactly how I wanted to um make sure that we
understand how bad things are for the immigrant community today and all I could think about was walking by 26
Federal Plaza where uh a bunch of uh New Yorkers and our siblings New Yorkers are
facing immigration proceedings and I was thinking about how just last week people
who were coming for their immigration removal proceedings were being picked up and detained when all that they were
doing was trying to complied with exactly what they were supposed to do the reality is that things are much
worse than they have ever been the work that our attorneys are doing and our legal services providers are doing is
much harder than it has ever been chairwoman Abules was talking and asking
about how bad things are for our staff members and the reality is that we do need more funding we are not able to do
the work that we're that we have to carry out especially today because we do not have enough funding in fact II is
defunded by about $12.5 million meaning that we fund about 50% of the work that
we do from other uh from other sources that we're able we have been able to find throughout these years the reality
is that not only things are much worse when we are litigating cases in front of immigration court but we also do not
have those sources of funding anymore so we're going to be facing a situation where we are not going to be able to
provide the services that our um New Yorker citizens need so much when things
are uh at the worst level possible so I ask here today on behalf of the
organization that I represent and the coalition that we represent to please you know help us advocating to get those
fundings that the funding that we need in order to be able to provide legal representation that is so vital for New
Yorkers today thank you good afternoon thank you so much for the committee for allowing me to testify my
name is Ernie Colette i'm the supervising attorney of uh the Immigration Law Project at Mobilization for Justice i appreciate obviously all
the city council's efforts for uh holding Moya and making sure that we have truth to power with regards to the
finances and the numbers and uh as many of my colleagues have already discussed quite frankly the funding is just not
enough for us to be able to maintain and continue representing a lot of immigrant New Yorkers
thank you very much Chairwoman Obvious for being able to sus out the numbers during the testimony but these are the numbers that I also feel are very
important for the committee to understand as well currently and this is just talking about immigration court New York State as of March 2025 we have a
little under a million people um in immigration court and approximately of that million we have about 62% uh that
are currently being represented it's that 38% that are prosay that really keep me up at night i know that anyone
here on this panel um and all the people that work for our legal services organizations are going to give them the
best possibility of being able to stay here in in the United States but that 38% is incredibly under attack when we
have an administration that's trying to effectively prioritize speed over due
process fast-tracking removal proceedings pre-termitting or terminating asylum applications that
maybe were considered to be adequate enough to get to the next step but uh judges are making the decisions that
they're not of course as we discussed earlier individuals being uh having their hearing terminated and then being
detained uh from ICE after leaving their hearing um cases being recalled
erroneously and then just policy changes in general with the OIR to make cases more difficult and that's only in
immigration court the communication and the advice aspect is fantastic it's excellent for us to be
able to talk to clients but as Mon'nique mentioned people are coming back to the same organizations over and over uh
trying to get more help and we're unable to do so we have a financial imperative here for the city but I also feel like
we have a moral imperative as well and it's our obligation as a city of immigrants to maintain that i know
you'll keep up the fight and we really appreciate it thank you
good afternoon my name is Sophie Dalsamer i'm co-director of the health justice program at New York Lawyers for
the Public Interest thank you Council Member and Chair Velis and members of the council for the opportunity to
testify today i'm also very privileged to testify with my colleagues here i'm in complete agreement with all of them i
want to speak to you this afternoon about the city council's immigrant health initiative which we are privileged to be a part of and ask that
you continue enhanced support for this program with a 655
$650,000 allocation to our organization for this upcoming fiscal year this work
could not be more critical in the face of unprecedented federal assaults on immigrant communities and healthcare i
was concerned today about the lack of specificity and urgency from Moyo when it comes to health care access and
mental health needs of immigrant New Yorkers and their families at our organization we are receiving and
responding to increased demand across four main areas first more and more people are being arrested and detained
by ICE as we know and we field many requests from KnifeUp and other partners for medical advocacy on behalf of
immigrant New Yorkers in ICE detention including uh forensic psychological evaluations that are critical to their
immigration cases many of the individuals who the city supported with prosay asylum assistance are now coming
up on their final hearings and they are unrepresented and we are hearing from many of those folks who are chronically
ill or people with disabilities who would have to face these proceedings unrepresented
we also continue to provide comprehensive health advocacy and insurance navigation to support
non-citizen New Yorkers who face barriers to accessing health care including advocacy with New York City
Health and Hospitals and connecting individuals to NYC care this is even more critical now as many individuals
are foregoing vital medical services in fear of ICE enforcement it has been critical to provide timely accurate and
trusted advice for these communities and finally NILB is responding to unprecedented demand from healthcare
workers themselves who are unsure about how they can create safe medical spaces for their patients and also protect
their own safety with your continued and enhanced support we look forward to meeting these urgent needs and
representing and advocating for our immigrant communities thank you thank you
no I just want to say um really quickly we hear you in terms of the overdue restoration of the legal services and
even that wasn't enough and I just want to ex expressly thank you and obviously
the panel before for the services that you have provided in this ongoing deteriorating conditions we know y'all
are the front lines and people are working really really hard um with not a
lot of support um so I just want to thank you and all your your teams um and
then I guess and also for bringing in actual facts and urgency into the room
that we did not see and hear uh several hours ago so I just have to acknowledge
that thank you um and we'll continue to to fight for all New Yorkers together
but deeply appreciate your services and your testimony today we have a question from council member
Brewer thank you be very quick first of all thank you Nyag for stepping up for Dylan thank you and then continuum of
care can you just descri I think I know what it means but when you say Moya said something that wasn't correct can you
correct it for us sure and I um invite others on this panel um uh again and I also echo you
know I'm really um so honored to be on the panel with all these superstars um
so with the knife of funding we can represent individuals who are otherwise
unrepresented who are venued here in New York City immigration courts or in New Jersey New York City residents um but
those are people who are unrepresented when they are detained and we're intaking them so and then the II funding
and although folks can jump in as well the II funding we're representing non-detained people so there's this sort
of there's this gap that exists and I think especially in light of these dismissals in immigration court where
somebody's not in removal proceedings anymore and then they're going to be whisked away and likely not be in
anywhere in the New York City area anymore those individuals are going to be disappeared they're going to be deported um and so I think there's just
this real sense of concern and urgency that these people are going to be immediately sent away we're not going to
see these people we're not going to see these New Yorkers anymore they're going to leave behind all their other families other um loved ones here that's very
helpful thank you just for the public understands thank you thank you all very much for all you do
okay our next panel we have Kennyanne or or Kenan
Pauls or Kerianne Pauls I'm sorry sarah Nolan
[Music] Uh I don't know how do you say that
sierra Craft grace Day grace Day grace Day margaret Martin lauren
Megalachio and Michelle Sion
thank you very much no I'm okay
from my right your left good afternoon and thank you to chairs Ailles and Brandon and to the New York
City Council for the long-standing support of the legal services for the working poor coalition aka
LSWP i'm Kianne Pauls and I am the interim executive director at take root justice one of the five members of this
coalition which also includes CAMA legal services housing conservation coordinators mobilization for justice
and nimic the LSWP Coalition was created with support from the city council 20
years ago to address the civil legal needs of working poor and other low-income New Yorkers whose income is
just slightly higher than the poorest New Yorkers thus rendering them ineligible for free legal services from
many organizations in fiscal year 2025 each of the five original members received
$455,000 from this initiative and in fiscal year 26 Take Root Justice and the other members of the LSWP coalition are
requesting a $600,000 allocation from the city council this enhancement would
support critical legal services and allow providers to deepen their impact in the areas where we are seeing
increased need including immigration workers rights public benefits and economic justice this is especially
important in this moment as the federal government is making it even harder for the working poor to maintain financial
stability and make ends meet and it is an exceptionally challenging time for our immigrant communities and just
speaking on behalf of Take Justice I'll say that this fiscal year the majority of our LSWP clients are seeking
immigration legal support so when the city invests in legal services for the
working poor we see that it's investing in strategic preventative measures to keep New Yorkers on their paths towards
financial stability and proactive intervention through access to legal assistance helps protect wages prevent
homelessness keep families in their communities childrens in their schools and New Yorkers out of poverty so thank
you again for your ongoing support and consideration of our request for the allocation of $600,000 for each of our
LSWP coalition members thank you
good afternoon Chair Ales Chair Brandon and members of the committees my name is Sierra Craft and I'm the executive
director of the IARE Coalition a city-wide network of legal service providers that for over a decade have
ensured that unaccompanied immigrant children in New York City have access to free legal representation thank you for
uplifting the needs of unaccompanied children um throughout the hearing this morning um we're in a moment of of
urgent crisis one that is unfolding in real time and in plain sight unaccompanied children are being
targeted through harmful policies and systemic failures and the consequences are playing out in our neighborhoods and
courtrooms every day children's dockets are being fast-tracked kids are receiving court dates before they've had
a chance to find a lawyer ice agents are conducting so-called wellness checks at showing up at 6:00 a.m at children's
homes asking probing questions even when their cases are already closed these visits are sewing fear and mistrust in
communities that are already on edge new sponsor requirements like fingerprinting background checks and strict ID policies
are keeping families apart we're watching family separation play out again here in New York City and recently
we had a young teen a child just herself who missed the hearing because she was giving birth during her her court
hearing but the judge ordered her removed anyway she didn't have a lawyer and she turned to us but our providers
are at capacity this is what it what it looks like when due process is denied when
children are forced to navigate one of the most complex legal systems in the country alone with everything at stake
we should all be outraged at a moment when legal services the need for legal services is exploding
the safety net is collapsing federal dollars are unstable and unpredictable and the government is currently buying
themselves some time to dismantle protections that would further endanger children and making it impossible for
them uh to plan for an attorney nonprofits can't plan like this
providers are having to lay off staff freezing intakes and turning children away city council has long been a
champion through the unaccompanied minors and family initiative but funding hasn't increased in over six years
despite the skyrocketing case loads and rising costs and the landscape is shifting by the day today we're asking
the city to meet the urgent need of this moment and that's why we're respectfully requesting 6.3 million through UMFI to
stabilize and sustain legal services across seven providers for 2013 children
and families and also $5.4 million in emergency funding to support the loss of
federal funding new York New York State turned its back on these kids in this year's budget making the city's role
even more critical we can't allow children toddlers and teenagers to be railroaded through a system they can't
possibly navigate alone thank you for your ongoing leadership advocacy and standing for young
immigrant New Yorkers
hi good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to testify today chairs Brennan and Avulz my name is Sarah Nolan
i'm the managing director of Kids in Need of Defense known as K's New York office we are also here as a member of I
the IARE coalition kind thanks city council again for your support in providing free legal
representation for unaccompanied children to add a little color um to a Sierra's testimony um we are also here
to ask for um incredibly important increased support for our work to counter the relentless efforts to strip
away legal protections for unaccompanied children who are now on the front lines of the mass deportation agenda
ice is conducting what they call wellness checks at homes with the intent to intimidate and further traumatize
children and their sponsors the reconciliation bill that just passed the House eviscerates
protections for unaccompanied children and could charge them up to $15,000 for
many of them to be released from custody and to apply for legal status which would bar them from accessing any kind
of protection the administration is also seeking to end the florist settlement that limits the amount of time children
can be detained and requires they be held in safe and sanitary conditions we've seen children who would have been
out of detention within weeks be held for now months because their parents and
caregivers cannot provide the ID or proof of finances for them to be
released at this moment unaccompanied children are in dire need of secure robust local funding for legal services
as the future of the federal support for this work remains very uncertain in March the federal contract that funded
over half of our work was abruptly cancelled in the weeks that followed the children who would have received kind's
advice and assistance under this contract no longer had access to counsel this included four children who decided
to return to their home countries without their parents or legal guardians there even there to receive them it
includes a teen from West Africa who has been already been in foster care for 18 months who confessed to us later how
scared and confused he was to suddenly have to go to court alone it includes a four-year-old girl from a central
America who was separated from her grandmother at the border after litigation was filed and in
an injunction was entered federal funding for these services has been temporarily restored but the administration continues to fight this
case in court and signal its intent to take away all protections from unaccompanied children we cannot rely so
heavily on federal funding in this climate to provide the foundation for legal assistance that these children so
desperately need data shows immigration judges are almost 100 times more likely
to grant legal relief when an unaccompanied child is represented by council this legal pres representation
provided by kind and Iare members is the key to increased stability for unaccompanied children and safeguards them from human trafficking and
exploitation we respectfully ask city council at a minimum to support the 6.3 million in renewed funding requested by
IARE and to allocate an additional 5.4 million in funding given the increased needs and uncertain future of funding
additionally we asked for the renewed funding for the II initiative thank you so much for your commitment to ensuring that all unaccompanied children in the
city remain safe and achieve their full potential
good afternoon uh council members chair vas chair Renan my name is Grace Day i'm a staff attorney at The Door a
comprehensive youth development organization that has been supporting young people in New York City since 1972 um we offer free access to healthcare
mental health services housing support education meals and legal assistance um and in 2024 alone our legal services
center handled more than 3,300 immigration matters um many of the young people that we represent are
unaccompanied children and we are part of the IARE coalition and receive funding from from the city um as you
we've been speaking about uh you are aware that unaccompanied children enter the US without a parent or legal guardian these children often qualify
for asylum or special visas for abused or abandoned children but without legal support they may never access the
protection they deserve shockingly as I think you know children have no right to an attorney in immigration court to help
them plead their case of course young children are unable to understand the complexities of everchanging immigration
law and effectively argue the merits of their cases children with representation in immigration court are seven times
more likely to access immigration relief and therefore as we fight the uphill battle that the next four years will
bring and are currently bringing as we're discussing we ask for the support of city council in the face of a federal
administration that is committed to targeting and terrorizing immigrant communities our city can use our
resources to defend these communities and to protect children iare funding for NYCU youth is critically important
because it provides essential legal representation for unaccompanied children in New York City who are un who
are now sometimes over 18 who are unable to be represented on other federal contracts increased funding for IAER at
the door ensures that we can connect these youth to legal representation but also to our suite of other vital services increasing the reach of this
funding as we support these youth transitioning to adulthood by investing into the IARE coalition and expanding
the support for the door city council can help us protect immigrant youth promote safety and stability for immigrant
communities today I urge city council to support immigrant youth in the city specifically I echo Sarah and Sierra's
request to fully fund the IARE coalition for $6.3 million and increase this funding as we face the terrors that are
um in our city um also I asked for the emergency funding for immigration legal services legal service providers and
expanding the support through welcome NYC and II funding with these supports we can continue defending immigrant
youth and offering them the protection and dignity they deserve thank you for your time and
consideration good afternoon my name is Michelle Sinc i am with Safe Passage Project i'm a government grants manager
thank you so much for the committee on immigration and on finance for having us um testifying today uh Safe Passage
Project is a nonprofit legal services organization that provides free representation to immigrant children
facing deportation right now we represent over 1,400 unaccompanied minors across New York City and Long
Island we're a proud member of the co um IARE coalition and our goal is simple we
just want to ensure every unaccompanied immigrant child in New York has access to high quality legal representation
most cases take three to six years due to serious backlogs in immigration court USCIS and family court they're legally
complex emotionally intensive and increasingly unpredictable with shifting federal policies and increased ICE
enforcement our work is made possible through the city council support particularly through um the
unaccompanied minors and families initiative but we are at a breaking point and I want to highlight some
urgent issues we are very grateful for the council's ongoing commitment to the IARE coalition but the funding has not
changed in over six years despite inflation rising case loads and increased complexity safe passage
project has um requested an increase to our IARE funding without success and for
FY26 we are again respectfully requesting the support of IARE through um funding for $6.3 million which
includes an increase um to safe passage project of 200,000 we are also requesting $100,000 in discretionary
funding for this fiscal year to ensure we can support our um the increasing number of children impacted by
immigration policy changes and enforcement our team including a pipeline of train attorneys and social
workers is ready we can act immediately to expand services we would also like to emphasize that while prosay models of
immigration services are useful for limited types of relief they cannot be the beginning and end of widescale legal
services for immigrants in the city we commend the city's asylum application help centers for assisting thousands in
meeting their asylum deadlines but these centers are not useful to unaccompanied minors unaccompanied children are placed
through the office of refugee resettlement and they face challenges in USCIS EIR and family court these cases
cannot be handled with limited scope they need dedicated attorneys who can see their cases through to resolution as
mentioned we were impacted by the termination of the unaccompanied children's program um our clients have
been visited by HSI for wellness checks these visits are deeply stressful and traumatizing experiences there are now
reports from national um partners in Connecticut and um neighboring states of
caregivers who are immigrants and sponsors of these children being placed being detained and placed in their own
removal proceedings following these visits it this destabilizes the child's case and it can shatter their support
system that they rely on in the US we are investing more time as an organization and more resources just to
keep our clients safe additionally our legal department receives at least one referral per week directly from foster
care agencies serving youth in ACS custody for long-term immigration representation while some of these cases
do qualify under IARE many don't because they're not in removal proceedings the cases that fall outside of existing
grant scopes are difficult for us to place and there's no dedicated city um funding stream for them without one many
children are left unrepresented not because their case is less urgent but because the system is not accounting for
them we are here today because we are deeply concerned about the lack of funding for youth who falls outside um
existing grant scopes we want to highlight the um increased absence of um
the increase uh the absence of an increase for IARE contractors by years of advocacy and the escalating
complexity of our clients legal um and personal needs without meaningful investment this year we risk abandoning
vulnerable children to navigate an increasingly complex immigration system alone thank you for your time and
dedication to supporting our work with New York City's immigrant youth
[Music] good afternoon and thank you chairs Brennan and Naves my name is Lauren
Millacho i am the training and legal technical assistance director of the immigrant justice corps which is the
first in the nation to place legal fellows at legal nonervice uh immigration providers uh since my most
esteemed co-panelists today have covered a lot of what I was going to speak about for New York's most vulnerable
populations i would like to first address your opening remarks chair and put some numbers here that I think can
shed a little light on why this is so important igc currently has 19 fellows
serving this community but that is funding that is dependent on the federal government and on March 24 March 21st
2025 the federal government did terminate that contract leaving many
children 26,000 exactly without funding for legal
service there has been a deep impact on the legal service providers here in New York City many organizations have looked
to layoffs have paused intakes and have turned children away for
representation eliminating federal funding will leave thousands of children without counsel and specifically here in
New York City in fiscal year 24 3,475 children were released from the
Office of Refugee Resettlement to New York City that is a number of children
that will be facing gaps and um instability in legal service
representation the looming fender federal cuts just leave a gaping hole
for no safety net left in these children and we do urge city council to take action and ensure that no child centered
representation is left and that every unaccompanied minor will be represented in New York
good afternoon Chair Ales Chair Brandon committee members thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today my name
is Margaret Martin i'm the co-director of immigrant and refugee services at Catholic Charities Community Services in
New York i'm here today to ask you to continue to advocate for a city funding
and awards process that meets the need of nonprofits to operate sustainably and recognizes this moment that we're in um
of increased and shockingly aggressive enforcement including at our New York City immigration courts and at the same
time as the federal administration is ending multiple pathways for immigration status and um Chair Abelis as you
recognized earlier that has made many of the cases that we do in legal services is more complex um and more urgent than
was true six months ago catholic Charities is a member of two II
coalitions including Iowa and with the legal aid society as well as the IARE coalition we are also one of the um
organizations that along with others up here had uh had our funding terminated
abruptly by the federal government to represent unaccompaning children in March um and I support and agree with um
the positions that my fellow panelists have stated uh with respect to those programs um Catholic Charities is
grateful for recent contract notifications from Moya um for renewal
of and an renewal and a new award um of some contracts so first of all we
received notification that the HRI Haitian Response Initiative Legal Services was renewed as well as our
hotline unfortunately those renewal amounts were not increased um to keep
pace with our increased expenses in fact for both hri and hotline we lost funding
that we were awarded last year to supplement the baseline funding for both hri and the hotline that means that we
will either need to supplement those programs with other funding or reduce services
um for hri uh many of the the individuals that we serve through hri
are facing increasingly complex and more urgent cases um and for them to lose our
assistance now for us not to be able to respond to the community need um would be extremely unfortunate so we ask that
you advocate for more funding for that program um as well as the hotline where we continue to see more urgent callers
um particularly as you noted with the closing of a O A O A O A O A O A O A O A O A O A O A OASU we AASU and the asylum
application help center we may see more of that um in coming months um and then finally uh Catholic Charities is a
member of the day labor worker initiative along with um five other providers and we request an increase to
$4.97 million for fiscal year 26 to fund the day laborer workforce initiative
thank you so much
thank you so much for all of your testimony and work um I I think I'd like to start with a question for you that
you noted um losing Alan funding i'm um deeply apologetic of not honing in
and asking them exactly where that money was going um I don't think I was going
to get an answer anyway because they don't seem to answer any much much of anything but in terms of
um I guess the reconstructed contracts like I feel like all we're doing is moving chairs around
the deck and calling it something different and wasting a lot of time and resources and aggravation for providers
to have to reapply to these new programs and constructs
um but um I guess you noted renewals of some
contracts that have remained flat but then losing others from the same entities that are going to be deciding
and saying there is seemingly more money i don't know where the more money is
i I don't think I have an answer to your question i don't know if I even have a question for you at this point i I did I
did want to note we did get a legal um support center award as well um although
as we've testified and many others have as well those awards do not cover the the required staffing or deliverables um
and we are also and this may in part answer what you were getting at we are one of the action NYC providers that was
notified that we got a contract a one-year contract extension um I think that's separate from the OS
on funding but I'm not I'm not entirely sure yeah I guess maybe by a show of
hands um how many of you have had conversations with Moya around the
disappearance of the federal contract and gotten any indication that there is
resources to for unaccompanied miners in
particular no one so the same conversation that Moya is having with OMB seems to be the same conversation
they're having with y'all which is not a whole lot of anything cuz it's clear there's a huge gap here that the city
should be feeling really super urgent to begin to address maybe it can't do the whole thing but there should be a plan
and we received no indication there is no plan but people are in a lot of conversations with each other
apparently thank you for your work and advocacy
thank you all very much okay our next panel
uh Iri Omar Gaban Harold Dusk
Robert Aznikad sorry Robert Aging
Agmang Arcelis Lucero Reva
Shang and Maline Bravo
how's your back you should have like a stand up desk
uh okay you want to start from the my right your left just turn your mic on
just hit the little button on the bottom all right good afternoon all uh my name
is Harold Dusk and I'm here on behalf of HaitianAmerican United for Progress
HUP a nonprofit organization that has proudly served New York City immigrants
and refugees community since 1975 hope's mission is to empower immigrants
and refugees by providing the tools and support they need to thrive we offer a
range of essential services including immigration assistance English as second
language instruction maternal and infant health program our work is guided by the
principle of equity access dignity helping community members
navigate complex system with confidence and respect one of the greatest challenges
facing immigrant New Yorkers today is language access
without access to skilled interpreters and culturally competent language
services individuals are often unable to obtain vital resources such as legal aid
health care housing and education as our city's immigrant population continues to
grow the need for comprehensive language access services becomes more urgent the
language access coalition representing immigrants from Africa Asia Central
America and the Caribbean has proposed the development of language banks and
interpreters cooperative these initiatives are essential to ensuring
that all New Yorkers regardless of language can fully access the services
they need and deserve this year marks hopes first as a member
of the language justice collaborative with support from this initiative we've
invested in the language proficiency testing interpreter and staff training and program development to strengthen
our language access services these investment have been vital to expanding
our capacity and improving service quality at the same time hope has experienced
significant cut in federal state and city funding due to recent policy
changes this reduction have placed enormous strain on our program just as
demand for services continue to rise today we respectfully urge the city
council to restore and expand funding for language access services without
sustained investment community based organization like hope will struggle to
meet the needs of the people we serve language access is not a privilege it is
a fundamental right and a vital public good i thank you for your time your
leadership and your continued commitment to building a more equitable and inclusive New York City thank you
good day Chairman Brandon uh Chairperson ALES my name is Robert
Aimang i'm the vice president of advocacy for the New York Immigration Coalition a statewide umbrella policy
and advocacy organization with over 200 members uh who are immigrants serving i
wanted to take the time to just thank you for creating a space for immigrant-facing
uh organizations to be able to speak about the executive budget my testimony
in total uplifts a ton in a host of different immigrant related programs and
fundings that varies the spectrum that impacts all immigrant New Yorkers but I
wanted to specifically talk about language the language access workforce initiative today uh specifically that it
is still remains a critical need um while working with our dedicated
colleagues from Hope and MASA and African Communities together Asian-American
Federation we continue to make strides with regards to the cooperatives the
language the language services worker owned cooperatives and we want to continue to develop and grow these
programs with respect to the community interpreter bank We're continuing to
forge ahead with its first cohort being of interpreters finalizing their
training in mid June and moving on to potentially medical and legal
interpretation uh certification depending on you know if they're able to finish the course and
wanting to acknowledge the work that we have done as well as with our partners
nice Lakomea Miss Tekka IC in continuing to broaden the pool of
interpreters and finally just wanting to uh put into the record we are
requesting the intentional baselining of funding for 7.8 8 million for the whole
initiative the cooperatives and the community interpreter bank for the continued development the consistency
that's needed for this program to begin to scale for the cooperatives and the
bank and just continuing to uplift the need for this executive budget to
reflect the urgency to deal with the affordability crisis the looming budget cuts and the
overcriminaliz ization of black and brown communities thank you
hello everybody my name is Arisero from MASA thank you for the opportunity to testify today um I'm also going to focus
on language justice but also have other nuggets in there that we wanted to plug in um we are an organization that is
based in the South Bronx we partner with immigrant communities from Latin America
and indigenous communities living in New York City to strengthen literacy leadership and power um as an our
immigrant community and advocates continue to navigate a cruel anti-immigrant political climate that
seeks to instill fear and rip families apart I think we understand the urgency we are facing and the need for continued
support um I'm going to start off with just echoing the ask from um the New
York Immigration Coalition the 7.8 million that we're requesting for the continuation of the Community
Interpreter Bank and the funding for the language workerowned cooperatives being led by MASA ACT and Asian-American
Federation we started this project in 2017 and be before that um with local
law 30 um to focus on ensuring that languages of limited diffusion were also
equally able to access interpretation
um services that were of quality um and this would include community legal
health and education interpreting as part of this initiative we currently do you guys hear that
maybe it's my computer
give me one second okay so as part of the initiative we
currently have 127 interpreters in the pipeline 52 of which are currently taking workforce development classes to
support their journey towards becoming interpreters um we have um approximately
40 interpreters who are going to be trained by the end of June 27 of those interpreters are English and Spanish
they hail from Mexico Peru Puerto Rico Dominican Republic Colombia Ecuador and El Salvador and we have um 13 indigenous
interpreters who are currently being trained in mom mea tunavi nawal garifona
and ketwa and we have students that um speak boretcha kichua kiche and hian
creole also in the pipeline um 23 of our um districts have been outreached and
were part of the uh process and this summer we um intend to continue to train
interpreters to do their practice and to um pick where they want to specialize
and I talk about all of this because it is really really like we've gotten this far and it's really important to
continue to support this initiative there's a lot of interest and a lot of people that have the assets of our
languages to offer and to provide better services especially in this need where due process is being um violated and
immigrants um don't really know what to do increase to access and education in
the languages that they speak is really important i also wanted to um briefly
talk about the prosay plus project and really focus on the plus part this is
part of the Ocelon network as we're finding out today that most of those providers um as part of that project
aren't being funded we have not yet heard but we did want to share that um
we have part of our funding is funded by Moya and the other part is privately funded by foundations um the importance
of that project um is that just like everybody else has spoken about the um
OASO closing people need to go somewhere a lot of those people are coming to all
of these organizations some of the work that we're focusing on is how to do trial prep preparation for them what to
expect how to be able to fight their case we heard the how overwhelmed um
lawyers are and so part of this work is to continue to support the people who
are or who have to navigate the process prosay you know give them a little bit more of an opportunity um we continue to
develop educational resources so that they're accessible to a larger community
and part of that project also includes ensuring that um there's translation and
interpretation services the how this all fits is that afilingual
and um our nonprofits are also being tapped into to do that work and we've provided interpretation services for
people going to their asylum um interviews um trying to go to the court
and we're getting increased requests and so there's an urgency to continue to move the interpreters that we currently
have through the pipeline and to specialize them and we can't do that without the continued funding so it'd be
really sad to see that just be cut abruptly um we're also here to advocate
for the rapid response network and um knife up and last I'll just plug in two
more initiatives the adult literacy initiative we need to continue to provide opportunities for our community
to be able to progress and to move into workforce development irregardless of
where there's a lot of fear but they still deserve an opportunity to go learn and to live their lives you know and to
better themselves and last but not least I do want to call for increased funding
for the um communication initiative with the New York public school system right
now it's at 3 million we're asking it to be increased for 7 million and again
that additional 3 million is to go towards meeting the growing need for translation interpretation services in
the school system which as we see is uh is being impacted and prime place for
community members to get information thank you for your time
um thank you Chair Brennan and Chair Vles and the Committees on Finance and Immigration my name is Reva Shang i'm
the economic empowerment community organizer at the Asian-American Federation where we represent a
collective of 70 plus member nonprofit organizations serving 1.5 million Asian
New Yorkers at AAF we believe that we should welcome all immigrants with fairness and dignity asian New Yorkers
are the fastest growing demographic in the city making up over 17% or one in six of the population af's rapid
immigrant support and empowerment or rise initiative is facilitating new immigrants access to critical services
and supporting the nonprofits that deliver them but today I'm going to focus on one important prong of our
immigrant support programs improving language access asian-americans have the highest rates of limited English
language proficiency in the city at 44% meaning nearly 1 in two Asian New
Yorkers face language barriers that limit their access to government services employment education and civic
participation as part of this work AF is a proud member of the Language Justice Collaborative along with African
Communities Together MASA NYIC Hope and IR which in 2017 helped pass local law
30 requiring New York City agencies to implement language access plans the implementation of that law has seen
agencies rely on poor quality machine translations that at times turn out nonsense translations and on unreliable
third-party teleservices like Language Line in fiscal year 25 city council allocated $3.8 million that allowed us
as a coalition to develop worker cooperatives of translators and interpreters as well as a community interpreter bank using this year's
funding AAF worked with our member organizations to recruit community members to serve as Asian language
interpreters we received over 160 applications and through rounds of screening we are now working with a
group of 16 immigrants who are fluent in the top Asian languages in New York City arabic Bengali Chinese both Cantonese
and Mandarin Korean and Erdo who are training as community interpreters and will go on to build a workerowned
cooperative these interpreters alongside translators from other immigrant communities served by LJC will be poised
to fill the critical need for highquality interpretation for NYC area government nonprofits schools hospitals
and the private sector while also providing opportunities for income and business ownership for the same immigrant communities that need them the
funding that we are requesting from council would allow us to continue building the cooperative with our trainees who will begin providing
services within FY26 and launch fully by the start of FY27 we applaud the
council's support this year and urge you to again support funding for this initiative in FY26 budget to ensure
continuity for these programs that are already in progress thank you again for the opportunity to testify and more
information on our immigrant rapid response programming can be found in our written testimony
thank you good afternoon chairs and council
members my name is Maline Bravo and I am the legal services coordinator at La Cormena we are a immigrant right
organization based in San Island and our mission is to empower the immigrant community through education culture
organizing and economic development for years La Cora has stood unapologetically
with our immigrant community often facing hostility and resistance however
we always remain dedicated because we know how critical this work is we've built a sanctuary of support resilience
and empowerment but we cannot do it alone today I am here to remind you of
the vital importance of ensuring that La Cora continues to receive the unwavering
support it needs from this council now more than ever as we navigate a
fastchanging policy environment we have been equipping our community members
with tools to navigate ICE interactions and preparing them with the power of attorney in case of deportation
proceedings but this is just the beginning our immigrant neighbors face not only the threat of deportation but
also wage theft discrimination and harassment this is why we ask to please
include us along with our partners in the day laborer coalition and the New York City coalition for domestic workers
so we can continue doing this important work we've also had to ramp up security at our own facility as we face
opposition from those who disagree with the work we do on Staten Island it is not easy to operate under these
conditions but we refuse to back down this is why laa exists to remind every
immigrant on Stan Island that they are not alone we are here to fight for them stand with them and uplift them however
to continue this critical mission we need your partnership and your commitment in supporting La Cora thank
you for your time your support and for standing with us as we continue this fight for justice and dignity for all
together we can build a strong and more inclusive Staten Island thank you thank you all very much

two years ago with a hope of finding stability opportunities and a dignified life for my family but instead I found a
reality of exploitation and abuse

humiliations for being lat Latin American they would call us dogs lazy
and they even told us I wish that they wish they deported us all Latins they
denied us water we didn't have time to eat and we worked day long journeys
without payment or extra hours and the worst that they never paid me what was corresponded to me
[Music]

made the complaint with the police and I have proof of everything
and thanks to the labor project uh labor justice project I didn't face this alone

thank you for listening to our stories and for considering our call and for justice and fun and funding thank you
good afternoon members of city council my name is Mohamad Dubaldi and I am a proud
delivery worker here in New York i have been riding since last year rain and
shine to make sure people get their meal and medicine often putting my own safety
at risk but now instead of being recognized and protected I feel targeted
in the in the past few weeks I've been seeing dozen of fellow delivery worker
many of them immigrant like me receive a criminal summones just for doing their
job they are not violent crime they are a ticket for riding ebikes often because
we don't know the exact rule or because we simply can afford to say no to the
short time of the app company give us to deliver the food these ticket cost us
time money in some cases they threaten our ability to stay in this country we
not criminal we workers we don't need moral policy what we really need is
education safe infrastructure and access to the tools that allow us to do our job safely and
legally right now in extremely difficult for many of us to even find
certified ebike that meet the city standards and the cost is out of reach
we ride 6 to 10 hours a day but we don't have places to rest to char to charge
our batteries or even to use bathroom that's why the delivery hub is so
important it's a space designed with our safety and dignity in mind the worker
justice project has proposed a fruitful plan to invest
thousand 100,000 street safety education case management and support for the
implementation of the delivery hub please don't use the city budget to
criminalize us use it to educate us use it to support us use it to make the city
safe safer for everyone riders and pedestrian alike we are not asking much
for much we are just asking to be treated with fairness dignity and with
respect that every essential worker deserve thank you for your time and for
listening to those of us who keep this city moving thank you
start
good afternoon my name is Alejandro Graales i'm a delivery worker and an organizer with the workers justice
project where I lead the work on wage theft and labor abuse today we heard the testimonies of three immigrant workers
who bravely shared their experiences extreme work hours threats stolen wages illness and fear but we also heard
something else thanks to the support of the Workers Justice Project they are now standing tall organized and fighting for
justice
julisa who couldn't speak today but has a message for us reports an abusive employer and received deferred action
just like over a hundred other workers rodulfo is working with the Department of Labor on a retaliation case and is
waiting for certification for a U visa and Jose who after more than three
decades in this country and being affected by 911 by 911 finally has
immigration protections none of these achievements would have been possible without the relentless support and work
of our organization
i speak not only as an organizer i also speak as a worker i know what it's like to work in the rain in the cold or under
fear or fear of being robbed getting into an accident being unfairly deactivated or not making it home that's
why I'm here because we know this fight is collective and it goes beyond ourselves
fundamentalist that's why I urgently ask you today secure the necessary funding for the workers justice program to
continue operating and growing we need your support to sustain these four essential programs $100,000 for safety
education and training program for delivery workers $250,000 for support for lowincome
workers 95,000 for worker cooperative development initiative 150,000 for support
initiative for women and immigrant workers
without these resources we won't be able to continue supporting the most vulnerable workers of our city today we
face enormous challenges labor abuse racism violence and misinformation it is precisely in times like these when we
most need your support because when a worker res recovers stolen wages or a delivery worker learns that they have
rights it's not just one person who wins it's the whole city thank you very
much good afternoon Chair Ables and members of the committee my name is
Arari Perez and I'm a program director of workers justice project i'm honored
to speak today on behalf of WJP members who are delivery workers day laborers
and domestic workers people who have who are work keeps this city alive every
single day i've seen fires hand the struggles our members face a stolen wage
unsafe jobs and now something even more frightening they are being criminalized
by the NYPD just for doing their jobs these essential workers risk their
health and safety to keep New Yorkers fit and cared for but instead of
protection they life in daily fear fear of
immigration rate rates at court at work even in their own neighborhoods this
fear is real and it tears family apart at workers justice project we stand
alongside our members we help them secure fair wage fair working conditions
and dignity we work with city agencies to provide the services they desperately
need but now under day NYPD and NYC mayor's adult policy delivery workers
are being targeted with criminal summ into a confusing criminal system
with little to no support it's heartbreaking no witness for five years
we have received no new fundings even as demand grows we've stretched every
dollars to the limit doing everything we can to support newly arrived immigrants
and delivery workers but the needs are overwhelming and without new resources
we cannot protect this community today I ask you to stand with us support this
vital programs that mean the the word to our members um
$200,000 for protect NYC immigrant families helping immigrant workers fight
back against informments 100,000 for citywide deliverist outreach
and safety training hang on hang on we need to get quiet in the chamber please while people are testifying
thank you thank you
$4,97,000 for the day labor workforce initiative a coalition that supports
every single uh worker in the day labor centers connecting workers with living
wage jobs and trainings $115,000 for OSHA 30 construction safety
trainings ensuring immigrant workers can work safely and $10,000 in discretionary
funding supporting every from job training to healthcare access this
dollar represents more than programs they represent hope dignity and the chance for better life for thousand of
workers who make this city round together we can build a new New York and
these values that uh protects uh all the city and all our workers thank you for
listening and for your support thank you all very much thank you
okay next we have uh Nibilia Coyote
thank you good afternoon Chair Abilles Chair Rana and members of the city council immigration and finance committees and fellow New Yorkers my
name is Na Coyote i am the executive director of NY's new immigrant community empowerment a community based
organization in Queens that is dedicated to nurturing the spirit of all immigrants and supporting the power and
potential of immigrant workers new New Yorkers and long-standing members of our city who are too often left behind i am
here today to speak about the essential role of our pre-apprenticeship for life and work program and to urge the city to
continue and straighten its commitment to organizations like NICE through stable and timely contract funding
particularly the workforce development initiatives such as the day labor workforce initiative immigrant gender
equity construction site safety initiative adult literacy pilot project welcome NYC and legal services such as
lowwage worker support among many others our pre-apprenticeship for life and work
provides immigrant New Yorkers with what they need most real access to opportunity we prepare individual most
of them low-wage workers and often excluded from traditional workforce systems for union apprenticeship skill
certifications and career pathways in growing industries like a structure green jobs and building maintenance we
do this in a cultural responsive linguistically appropriate and worker centered way but this program is not
just about skills it's about dignity mobility and survival every week I meet with participants who are navigating
multiple barriers language immigration status lack of health health services
options discrimination and economic hardship there are newly arrived immigrants day laborers domestic workers
and job seekers people who keep the city running but who are constantly fighting to stay afloat because beyond beyond job
training we equip our participants with critical life skills that are essential for surviving and thriving in the city
these are the things that we don't talk about yet that determine whether a person can fully participate in society
understanding how to navigate the transportation system access health services and insurance manage finances
and open a bank account etc in addition to workforce and life skills
development NICE provides critical legal education and support services to help our community members navigate an
increasing an increasingly hostile environment every day we offer no your rights workshops to ensure immigrants
understand the protection under labor immigration and criminal justice systems
these sessions are not theorical they are tools for survival whether is a worker facing wage staff of someone
targeted by immigration enforcement our legal empowerment works helps them recognize abuse assert their rights and
access support in this moment when immigrant communities are under extreme harm um these legal services are
essential to protect lives prevent exploitation and build collective power for them NICE is a lifeline and
the pre-operative for life and work is often their first step toward a more stable future
we are deeply proud of our of the impact of our program however I must be honest our ability to continue delivering these
results is under threat we call on the city council to ensure full and continue
funding for immigrant service workforce programs language access welcome welcoming new immigrants legal services
health services etc in total over 1 million for NICE in different awards
expedite reimbursements and budget approvals so that nonprofits are not forced to carry the cost of city
services and center immigrant and worker-led organizations in the design and funding of workforce development
initiatives particularly those that serve undocumented and lowincome New Yorkers on behalf of NICE and the
immigrant workers we serve I thank you for your time and your leadership gracias
thank you for your testimony okay now we have
uh Paulina Cohen Scarlett
Thompson Paula Inaru Natalia from Make the Road Timothy
Sheen Julian Cologne and Jing Willie
group are you
okay so hang back and we'll call you up together
okay good afternoon to uh Chair Ailas and all the council members present my name is Natalia Sawal and I'm testifying
and I'm deputy director of McDero New York and I'm testifying on behalf of our 28,000 plus members um my written
testimony is longer and I actually was going to start with some of the work that we're doing but I want to start our
um verbal testimony talking specifically about the student Dylan who was picked up in the Bronx and it's important to
highlight this case because Dylan did not have any criminal record he um did the process for asylum at the border and
he is or he was in a current process and he decided with his lawyer that he
should show up to his immigration case what we saw in Dylan case is two things a practice that we're seeing now from
immigration where they're dismissing an immigration case so that ICE can pick up the person outside and a lot of these
people actually get represented by the rapid response initiative which currently this year we're asking for 25
million for legal representation including a restoration of 600,000 that was taken away last year
and I'm highlighting this is because these cases were we're seeing them more and more where ICE just only wants to
pick up people um who are brown and it doesn't matter what immigration case people have and it's really unfort
unfortunate to see a student get picked up um and both the DOE and the mo and the mayor's office of immigrant affairs
should be doing more um to help in his case we additionally also want to baseline um baseline the current funding
of 1.6 million we want to invest 55 million in immigration legal services to expand access to representation and
increase in baseline 40 million for the immigrant opportunity initiative and renew the protect New York families
initiative to support immigrant New Yorkers um additionally we're asking to fully fund the department of consumer
worker protections at 2.5 million for workers rights enforcement to ensure um
that uh the new minimum pay rule for delivery workers and more um we expand
the low-wage worker support initiative to three million so we can help immigrant workers fight stolen wages and
learn their rights and restore the commission on human rights um I want to highlight just to quickly education
programs we want to make sure that there is double baseline funding for DYCD funding adult literacy programs from 12
to 24 million to maintain adult literacy discretionary funding at 16.5 million
including the adult literacy uh pilot and we want to we're grateful that that
14 million was included in the executive budget for community schools we still need 3.3 million for student success
centers 12 million for restorative justice and last but not least we can stop using um some of the money uh to
have safety agents or NYPD in schools since students don't feel safe anymore
with NYPD in their schools thank you
good afternoon everyone um it's good to see some of you from the preliminary hearings and I know it's been a long day
of testimony so I appreciate your your commitment i'm Paulina Cohen i'm a staff attorney at the New York City
Antiviolence Project um you heard from a lot of great legal service providers that are doing a lot of great
immigration work but I'm here to talk about AP which has long been at the forefront of New York's fight against
hate and oppression our crisis hotline is open 24 hours a day and we offer critical support to LGBTQ and immigrant
communities including clients in all of your districts so I want to thank you for your ongoing support it's becoming
harder for LGBTQ and immigrant New Yorkers to access justice and safety and there's no guarantee of legal
representation in the immigration system which leaves thousands to face serious legal and human rights challenges all
alone we at AP however are committed um to serving the most vulnerable and we
recognize the council's commitment to protecting immigrants we recently filed an amicus brief supporting your lawsuit
against the mayor's office for allowing ICE at Rikers and I'm here to ask you to help complete this puzzle by ensuring
sustained and increased funding for immigration legal services ap is the only LGBTQ specific victim services
agency in the city we provide culturally competent legal services including including humanitarian immigration
relief alongside holistic support we do outreach to ensure survivors know about and can access our services and we
advocate on a broader scale like by filing the amicus in your case to lift up the issues our clients face i want to
tell you quickly about one of my clients i'm going to call her Daisy daisy came to us with a with a really complex
immigration case her case had been bouncing between the immigration agencies and immigration courts and she
didn't have a clear grasp on the status of her application with ambiguity leaving her
vulnerable to wrongful apprehension by immigration authorities we intervened filed the right motions got her asylum
application properly filed and she was also able to finally get her work permit which was years overdue thanks to AP's
continued support Daisy now has clear legal status and the ability to work which gives her which allows her to
continue the positive life she's building here in New York daisy is just one of many in fiscal year 24 ABP's
legal department handled over 280 cases nearly 70% immigration related this need
is growing especially among our transgender clients who have been specifically targeted by hateful federal
policies we fill critical service gaps where the city resources fall short and
our collocation model connects legal and social services helping survivors holistically rebuild their lives with
your support we can expand that work especially in light of cuts to our federal funding funding from you all
will allow us to provide direct services outreach and advocacy that are all really essential in this acute moment of
crisis simply put without your help we cannot continue to keep our communities safe
ap is committed to ensuring that our community members have access to justice and safety and I'm asking this committee
to show that same dedication thank you for your ongoing support and for the opportunity to testify
good afternoon Cherilus and distinguished members of the New York City Council Committee my name is Julian
Kolong and I'm a literacy program coordinator and ESOL teacher at the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park
also known as CFL i'm here today to call on city council to maintain the full
amount of $16.5 million of discretionary funding for adult literacy initiative
and adult literacy pilot project over the past four years serving the immigrant community of New York City has
been an honor and a privilege i've been fortunate enough to have the hardest working most dedicated students in my
classroom whether to pursue new professional ventures return to school and complete a degree prepare for the
citizenship exam or simply develop better communication skills to connect with their children the individuals who
have gathered at CFL all arrive with a drive and sense of perseverance that is nothing short of
inspiring eager to learn and share their culture and experiences these students continue to inspire me on a daily basis
and inform my teaching they remind me every day why I do what I
do and that it is never too late to pursue your dreams regardless of who you are or where you come from we are truly
grateful that the New York City Council provided us with the necessary resources to rescue our ESOL program after a 24%
reduction of DYCD's adult literacy program from their previous procurement
as Sunset Park has the third highest concentration of individuals with limited English language proficiency in
New York City your support has allowed me to continue classes in our high need
area this need hasn't gone away we estimate that our ESOL waiting list is
in the thousands and interest has remained steady even in the face of xenophobic federal policies thank you
for partnering with us in this fight to protect adult education classes such as mine that take place across the city
each day that enrich educate and nurture those seeking a better life in the United States those of us within the
field of language education particularly within the nonprofit sector view language education not as a commodity
but as an essential service that should be available to all with your efforts we can continue to provide these services
to those who need them the most who would otherwise not have access to such resources nor the opportunity to realize
their full potential thank you
good afternoon Chair Azair Brennan and distinguished members of the council
committees i'm Tim Sheen and I'm chair of the board of the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park and I'm joining
Julian here today and others to urge the city council to protect our immigrant community by maintaining the full 16.5
million in discretionary funding for the adult literacy initiative and the adult
literacy pilot project through discretionary funding our ESL
ESO program offered at no cost enables New Yorkers with limited English proficiency to begin their journey
toward dignified working conditions improved pay increased access to public benefits and a greater sense of
belonging in our neighborhood a worthy investment a recent report from the
United Neighborhood Houses highlights the positive impact economic and social
impacts of investment in our community members through adult literacy programs
for example the first randomized evaluation of a publicly funded ESOL
course in Massachusetts published in the journal Economic Policy found that those who
participated increased annual earnings by 56% in Sunset Park this is
seen through the story of Raul a student at CFL with an unwavering commitment to
learning who day after day took risks learned skills and gained confidence in
his abilities to to communicate in English through his own initiative our
classes propelled him to prepare for and enroll in community college where he is
now pursuing his passion for chemistry with the goal of becoming a pharmacist
with the support of the city council in FY25 75% of our program participants
showed improvement in their English proficiency leading to outcome outcomes like our rules that can support working
families and strengthen our community but I want to say that these
benefits go beyond the individual the economic and social benefits of ESOL
programs redown to the city's economy and to the city's fiscal u to the city's
fisk i'm glad that uh chairman Brandon is here to hear this so in the
Massachusetts study they found that the increase in earnings over time this 56%
of the individuals increase in earnings over time paid for the cost of the
program and actually generated a 6% return to taxpayers an earlier study
called Eager for English a report that was prepared by firm Apple Seed for the
New York Immigration Coalition in 2004 showed that increasing the supply of ESO
ESOL classes in New York City would more than pay for itself by increasing the
skill level of program participants thereby their total economic impact it provided it would
provide a net increase to New York City and New York state taxes so these programs beyond their social benefits
can be looked on as economic development programs and probably have a bigger bang for the buck than any other economic
development program you might consider so um ideally our ESOL program would be
supported by a robust baseline uh budget managed by DYCD with continue
with stable year-over-year funding however until DIYCD revises its policies
it is crucial that the New York City Council continues its support to ensure that adult learners continue to have
access to the pathways they need to thrive thank you very much for your consideration
good afternoon thank you to Chairless Chair Brandon and members of the immigration and finance committee for
the opportunity to testify my name is Jimn Wii and I'm a student from the New York High School as part of the youth
advocate team at the Chinese American Planning Council when I first arrived in America
I was very afraid to admit that I was from Venezuela there was a pervasive discrimination towards people like me
and I grew up being bullied i was afraid that if anyone knew who or where I came from they looked at me differently and
reject me when I came in touch with CBC I slowly found my own values and was accepted into this community
obtain opportunities and achieve things that I never thought I would be able to accomplish i was able to get my first
job as a supervisor where I was able to oversee and manage more than 30 workers in this community and through
these experience that CBC has offered me i learned to truly appreciate who I am and where and I'm here to proudly tell
you where I came from in light of federal threats our city must live up to its values and
adopt a budget that meets the growing needs of working-class and immigrant New Yorkers we need to fully fund the social
safety net which includes the service and programming provided by organizations like CBC
we're also urging to expand access to support services such as housing vouchers to all New Yorkers regardless
of immigration status to increase investment in Promise NYC and allocate
additional funds for adult literacy to meet the needs of our newest New Yorkers investments such as these will
enable all families to improve their economic prospect more fully integrate into their communities and thrive thank
you so much for the opportunity to testify on issues that really impact our communities
uh thank you so much uh obviously to this entire um panel and I have to give a special shout out to my CFO and CPC
colleagues to all of y'all um I just wanted to underscore the thank
you for pointing out obviously the probably very minimum return on investment that we get from adult
literacy it is confounding to me that our city has not seen the multiple uh
the multiplication benefit of this service for so long and has been like
defunding it for so long so we're going to continue to fight to expand literacy funding because it is absolutely
critical to our organizations to our communities to our city so thank you so
much thank you for your continued support thank you all very much
okay next panel we have Zachary Katz
Nelson Megan French Marcelin Serita Daftani Jennifer Parish
Roberto
Pon what
there's
want to begin from your left sure thank you so much uh good afternoon i'm Zachary Katz Nelson i'm the executive
director of the Independent Rikers Commission thank you for the chance to testify today uh I want to first thank
the council for its continued uh support and and push for the investments that discussed in its press release this
morning investments to address mental illness to address recidivism and re-entry investments that are critical
to public safety to closing Rikers and to ultimately saving this city money
they are pennies on the dollar compared to Rikers but the return will be tremendous as opposed to Rikers itself
which it's hard to imagine a worse investment this city can make than continue to pour money into Riker's Island i want to touch on two things
based on the Department of Corrections testimony today uh department of corrections said it had that the state
commission on correction has done a staffing analysis of one jail on Riker there are eight open jails on Rikers so
what would happen if the state commission or somebody else actually analyzed the staffing at all eight jails
on Riker's Island what would that budget look like as compared to what we have today you know notably when the the DOC
said the state commission looked at the Belleview outposted units it found that many fewer officers were needed than the
Department of Corrections said so the the council could require the Department of Correction to do a departmentwide
analysis both civilian and uniform staff and then produce a budget that actually matches the true need whatever that
turns out to be secondly re-entry you know time and again we hear about people
who are released from Rikers people who are getting treatment inside mental mental health or addiction treatment who
are not properly connected with service providers on the outside that is missed opportunity after missed opportunity
it's no wonder that a third of people who are released from Rikers every year are back there within a year why don't
we set up a system when somebody is going to be released that the service providers on the outside who are meant
to help them continue their drug treatment for instance they get noticed that it's going to happen we have a system right now to service providers
when people are arrested why don't we tell them when people are due to be released so we don't miss yet another opportunity thank you so much
good afternoon chair Brandon chair nurse chair um I am Sita i'm co-director of
freedom agenda we're one of the organizations leading the campaign to close Rikers our members have
experienced Rikers and been impacted by crime and they know what works to create public safety things like housing
healthcare work opportunities and mentorship while Mayor Adams has said he wants to close the pipelines that feed
Rikers his budget would leave gaping holes in our city's mental health infrastructure and social safety net
continuing to funnel vulnerable New Yorkers into Riker's Island where they are subjected to violence deadlocking sexual assault now also potential being
picked off by ICE uh we we're calling on the city council to ensure that the adopted budget paves the way for New
York City to close Riker's Island and we appreciate the emphasis that the council has already put on those investments one
important uh tool we want to point out to you or uh is the possibility to reallocate $150 million that the that
the city is currently planning to spend to hire,00 more correction officers instead of spending money on those
additional officers uh we should be spending we should invest be investing to help New Yorkers thrive that includes
70.6 million more to meet critical mental health and housing needs 2.4 million more is for for alternatives to
incarceration and re-entry programs 8.1 million more for the board of correction to adequately conduct their oversight
and $3 million to begin a master plan for renewable Rikers doc spending is such an epic scandal that it's sometimes
hard to put into context honestly this is an agency that a federal judge has described as both overstaffed and
underserved while OM has pushed for vacancy reductions at agencies that provide vital services to improve
people's lives DOC has escaped even the suggestion of such cuts despite their vacancy rate growing for three years
straight why is this special treatment being given to the one agency in the city that is actually required to shrink
in the next few years under the plan to close Rikers when the Independent Rikers Commission estimates that the burough
jails will require only 3,240 uniformed officers at most why is DOC budgeting
for 7,60 which is,00 more than their current headcount um DOC has pitched
hiring staff more staff as a way to curb excessive overtime ibo published a report that shows that's not the case um
just to wrap up we're grateful that the council in your budget response is aligned with us and so many New Yorkers and calling for investments in mental
health at a scale that finally reaches the need and we know what OM is going to tell you they're going to say there's no money for that um so we need the council
to be prepared to say there's $150 million in this budget to hire,00
unnecessary correction officers and we need this administration to get their priorities straight i'll submit along
with this a full analysis um of the budget that outlines our investment priorities thank you
hi good afternoon my name is Jennifer Parish i'm the director of criminal justice advocacy at the Urban Justice
Center Mental Health Project uh thank you for this opportunity to testify and for all the that the council has done
related to closing Rikers i'm here today to express our opposition to the Department of Corrections exorbitant
budget and urge the council to reallocate a portion of that agency's $1.2 billion budget in a way that
actually benefits our community and reduces incarceration those are investments that will improve public
safety and advance the plan to close Rikers the Department of Correction has demonstrated to you time and time again
that it's incapable of fulfilling its fundamental obligation to keep people in its custody safe and healthy just two
weeks ago in the class action Nunes versus Department of Correction Chief US
District Judge Laura Swain issued a decision finding it necessary to appoint a remediation manager this is an
individual outside of the department independent of city hall to protect the constitutional rights of incarcerated
people and reduce y violence this decision came after years actually nine years of being monitored nine years of
failing to um comply with the consent judgment um and multiple remedial orders
the judge identified 18 uh core provisions that the city was in contempt of but what the court did not find was
that the department was understaffed she said that the department has enormous resources which are not being
effectively deployed and she specifically described it as overstaffed so the city must stop pouring money into
the dysfunctional department of correction and that should be done in this year's budget they have allocated
far too much money for uniform staffed 7,060 officers and that's not going to
happen it's not going to be filled there are,00 vacancies and you heard this
morning that they testified there's a small number of recruits joining the department and a significant number of
staff that are going to retire um we support all of the uh budget allocations
that are included in the campaign to close Riker's um analysis of the budget and we hope that you'll fund them
instead of the department of correction
thank you to the city council um Chair Aulas and the committee on immigration for your attention and commitment to
supporting uh New York City's immigrant community in the 2026 fiscal budget cycle my name is Roberto Pon community
engagement associate for Hobbre Kitchen and I'm testifying today on behalf of Hobbre Kitchen an organization that
creates economic opportunity through job skills training food entrepreneurship and an ecosystem of support for
individuals who face barriers to meaningful careers um this year we will continue our efforts to provide
workforce training for New York's asylum seeking population over the past 17 years Habre Kitchen has enrolled over
2,000 program participants into our programs to help them launch careers in the food industry start and grow their
small business and access the resources they need to succeed at work and in the world our community includes residents
of 50 city council districts 91% of our members identify as people of color with
86% identifying as women just over half our members across our programs were born outside of the US and are
non-native English speakers with approximately 82% of our members unemployed before starting one of our
programs they've reached starting wages postgraduation of about 18 to $22 an
hour our members are dedicated hardworking New Yorkers seeking opportunities for meaningful careers
sustainable income and long-term wealth generation for their families um we offer our members several programs
to reach economic mobility including culinary career pathways for New Yorkers
we provide uh wraparound support case management referrals to our 200 plus
community- based organizations to access child care vouchers affordable housing mental health services we provide Metro
cards stipens and job placement to our network of employer partners um we're very grateful to have received funding
from the city council which has supported our growing number of enrolled members and our expansion of offerings
into other bureaus including Bronx Brooklyn and Queens with the council's investment we have surpassed our
three-year strategic growth uh goal of 1,000 bread winners strong by 2000 we
are renewing our efforts to seek the council support for culinary career pathways for New Yorkers in fiscal year
26 specifically for the continuation of this needed program and ask for your support for 100,000 welcome New York
City initiative funding some support for women immigrant u workers initiative requests with the arrival of uh an
unprecedented amount of migrants and asylum seekers in New York City over the past several years um Harbor Kitchen
developed and launched this program by adapting our training to targeted to provide targeted services for this
asylum seeking population in 2025 we graduated one cohort of 24 members and
we just began another one of 25 for both cohorts we have over 500 applications um
um we continue to serve more New Yorkers each year in accessing economic mobility and we respectfully urge the committee
on immigration to support our applications for funding for this vital year thank you for your attention and investment in Hopper Kitchen's work
good afternoon my name is Megan French Marcelen i'm the senior director of New York State Policy at the Legal Action
Center today I testify on behalf of the New York City Alternatives to Incarceration and Re-entry Coalition um
we are a network of 12 service organizations with decades of experience
in providing holistic community-based supports to justice involved New Yorkers
collectively we serve more than 30,000 New Yorkers each year let me start by
just saying Riker has proven to be a terrible and very costly public safety
strategy but our programs are not um these programs are actually some of the
most meaningful mechanisms we have available to envision and scale a more
just justice system um these programs are not just about human potential
however they're also evidence-based effective interventions supported by
decades of research in fact that research has shown us that our programs
are more effective than incarceration at reducing recidivism keeping people from
committing new crimes connecting people to services and keeping people employed
and we actually do this at a cost much cheaper than the Department of Correction
um incarcerating just one person at Riker for a year is over
$500,000 atis create cost savings studies estimate that for every dollar
spent on ATI between $3 and $5 is of
benefits are generated um this year the count the coalition is asking for $2.4
million in additional discretionary funds and to put that into some
perspective that whole ask is just 10% of what the DOC spends monthly on
overtime um if you can read my full written testimony it has examples of
both how we have used discretionary funds in the past and how we plan to use
the additional funding to bring these programs to scale and make sure that all
New Yorkers have access to effective holistic communitydriven supports thank
you
thank you all very much okay our next panel we have Scarlett
Thompson Andrea or Andrea Rodriguez and Jasmine Joseph
okay whoever wants to start good afternoon thank you for the
opportunity to speak here today my name is Scarlett Thompson i use she her pronouns and I am a senior prevention
coordinator at the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault i'm here today to speak with you about an often
missed point when it comes to conversations about criminal justice which is preventing harm before it can
even happen i'm asking you today to commit to investing $300,000 to support
Outsmart NYC a program that focuses specifically on sexual violence
prevention within New York City Nightlife this program is a collaborative effort with the crime
victims treatment center and a collective of people who work in nightlife some of whom have joined me on
this panel today the rates of sexual violence in the US are staggering one in two trans
or gender non-conforming people one in four women and one in six men will
experience sexual violence in their lifetimes last year we conducted a survey of New York City nightlife
workers in which 70% of the nightlife staff who responded said that they
frequently witnessed sexual violence at work and 60% had experienced sexual
violence at work outsmart works to prevent sexual violence by training staff to recognize and intervene in harm
we work with managers and owners on policies and environmental changes that increase safety and providing support
resources to the nightlife community we have trained over 100 venues that range
from small wine bars on the Lower East Side to clubs that host thousands of people a night in Bushwick we also
provide safety advocacy for massive events like Red Bull's Culture Clash event last year and Pride events
throughout June our team here at Outsmart has been working tirelessly to support patrons and staff for over 10
years now and we know how much further our reach could go if the city council allotted the $300,000 we are requesting
even without the staffing we need to conduct outreach the demand for our programming far outstrips our current
staff capacity to meet it i implore you to invest in community- based safety efforts led by and for the people who
make up the heart of New York City
nightife um good afternoon and thank you for allowing us to speak today uh my name is
Jasmine Joseph and I work for Outsmart as their administrative associate and
social media manager however I've also been working as a professional DJ in New
York City Nightlife for over 10 years i also currently work as a DJ in New York City Nightlife in addition to my role at
Outsmart um this allows me to do several things for one I can bring back
experiences that I'm having uh in my work as a DJ back to the Outsmart team
uh which they use to help make their curriculum and trainings their bystander intervention trainings which we offer to
New York City nightlife venues as relevant as possible um I'm also tapped
into the New York City nightife community uh specifically New York City nightlife workers and performers as
somebody who's been dejing in New York City nightife for over 10 years and I hear a lot of things through word of mouth scarlet shared with you stats and
stats are great however sexual violence is seriously under reportported
especially in the New York City nightlife community where a lot of things that we experience our jobs and
income depend on our us being able to tolerate it uh in so many words um and
so I am able to bring back a lot of things that I'm hearing through word of mouth from my community to the outsmart
team and they're able to apply the things that I'm bringing back to them to help tailor their trainings um and to
help make New York City nightlife community comfortable with us when we come in because there are nightlife
workers on the staff who can speak their language with them um additionally I
just want to say that prior to being a DJ I was simply a patron i am a native
New Yorker and I love this city new York City nightife is a huge part of the
social fabric of this city and I really truly believe after the past three years of working with outsmart that uh the
work that they do is incredibly impactful and I really think that the funding would help us to expand our
reach outside of Brooklyn Manhattan where we're most active to burrows like Bronx and Queens and also upper
Manhattan Harlem where we're really looking to target um so thanks again for
allowing me to speak hi everyone my name is Andrea and I
started with smart in May of 2023 as the health equity and life leazison um I'm
also a patron of nightlife and I also perform harm reduction for night life um and as a child of immigrant I understand
this the importance of spaces for joy dance and also the importance of immigrants in night life community as a
queer person nightlife has been a lifeline new York has always been a cultural epicenter for the world and so
much of that culture comes from night life what I've come to understand is that night life is neutral she has and
will always be there for all of us to celebrate to grief to create work
inspire and heal this spaces where many of us can finally decompress and take off the mask we've been wearing all day
and sometimes all of our lives i believe that everyone deserves to return home not safe but well
also goes beyond safety it's about the well-being of everyone and every
stakeholder in the room we meet we meet businesses where they're at we do not signal v virtue we tailor our workshops
to reflect our the culture of each venue the people who work there and the communities they serve without
compromising our values and principles we also take the history and context of night seriously last year we brought
together a group of trans life trans nightlife workers who designed a training specifically to center the
well-being of trans and gender non-conforming people this community is not only at higher risk and also and
also has and will always shape so much of nightlife culture in New York and around the world the training piloted at
Elsewhere in Brooklyn included a framework from one facilitator's PhD research it focused on a spectrum of
safety for trans people from the absence of harm to the presence of celebration and belonging it helped staff understand
how part of uh how every part of a venue including how security checks are done can be made more
affirming we ask we are asking for your support so we can continue to support New Yorkers we're also working in
language accessibility as immigrants uh and nightife workers are facing unprecedented unprecedented times uh and
becoming more at risk we offer drug workshops right now um and information in English and Spanish at this time uh
we are asking for your support so we can continue supporting New Yorkers and if you want to know how health of how
healthy a city is look at its night life and for many of us a DJ really did save
our lives thank you thank you thanks for all you guys do thank you thank you
okay this is our final in-person panel before Sandy turns into a pumpkin um we
have Kate Tiscus Yankee Taring Natali Aril Ardilia Richard
Flores and Raul Rivera
you want to begin go ahead um thank you so much for holding this hearing today
uh I wanted to talk a little bit about programs that the council is already supporting that really help make sure
that folks who are justice impacted and people who are immigrants are able to get the services that they need um which
is becoming even more important as demands on them are made worse and worse
by the federal administration uh first there's a bunch of really great workforce development programs that the
council supports pride at work uh works with LGBT people who are justiceimpacted
LGBT people who are who are um without homes people all over the map and it's
actually the nation's first and only uh publicly funded partnership between
union high road employment and queer organizations it's working like a charm one of the organizations in it has
literally 100% employment placement which in this economy is crazy um also the domestic workers empowerment
initiative and the workers cooperative business development initiative both focus on making sure people who might
not have their documents totally in order are able to have safe dignified
access to workplaces but also to understand and know the rights that city
council has worked really hard to pass for them uh the city council's human rights law work for domestic workers is
first in the nation and in order to be able to use that law domestic workers got to know about it which is what the
domestic workers empowerment initiative does um sort of breezing on to folks who are
especially justice impacted support for persons in the sex trades is really kind of hitting all over the map in terms of
providing support for people who are coming into the city who are sort of finding that is their first place uh
where they're needing to seek employment making sure that they can get access to city services and go about their
business safely is so important and that initiative is asking for an increase to 7.4 million and um my wrap-up sentence
is the sexual assault initiative also keeps a close eye on folks who are
justice impacted um it's the city council not the mayor not the state only
the city council funds the sexual assault initiative so thank you for your work with that as well
can you hear me yeah oh good afternoon and you know thank you for your patience i was concerned that after a certain
point we would be asked to leave so anyway um thank you to all the members of the committee on immigration my name
is Yangi Sharing i'm the executive director of a company capital we're a CDFI a community development um
financial institution and what we do is we focus on providing access to affordable credit financial education
and training uh the loans we provide range from a th00and to 350,000 so very
very numerous micro entrepreneurs and then going up to working with small
businesses uh since our founding we have expanded economic opportunities
primarily for immigrants refugees underserved entrepreneurs and we've dispersed over 68 million in business
loans uh created 10,000 unique uh 3,000 new jobs and worked with over 10,000
unique businesses and saved more than 11,000 jobs uh citywide so while our
mission is to create pathways to prosperity for micro and small businesses um their very presence in the
city is being threatened by recent executive orders as we're all aware and
obviously a lot of the federal funding that we had access to has been decreased
or is under threat of being eliminated um last year we served clients from over
57 countries uh we want to thank city council for the recent creation of the
CDFI initiative and through this funding our team has already supported 25
businesses we're on track to serve 40 over 40 businesses and these are
businesses that would not qualify for services with the funding we currently
have so these are street vendors cleaning services and catering businesses
up so uh we are fully aware that there will be further decreases restrictions
we have a proposal pending for the CDFI initiative to continue our existing
partnership with Asian-Americans for equality and business outreach center to
create economic opportunity for over 250 entrepreneurs who currently do not
qualify to get services with the current funding we have we have a grant of
request of 330,000 pending we strongly encourage you to keep in mind all the
risk facing immigrant refugee in the small business communities these businesses need support thank you for
your time and on behalf of everyone at a company capital we look forward to strengthening and partnering with the
other organizations that are represented here thank you thank you very much go ahead sir
council me council member Brennan thanks for giving me the opportunity to
testify i've listened to testimony protecting the rights of
illegals and migrants at this hearing including those who are living and
working in New York City those who haven't been
deported or those who haven't been imprisoned as a result of
committing crime the reason why I'm mentioning
this is yesterday Memorial Day I was physically and sexually
attacked for being a cisgender male and I was sitting at a public area outside
the offices of 17 State Street which is in the financial district
i was formerly employed there for a company called Shareholders
Communications and I was a CSR there from 1994 to 1998 till 2001 in 2001 I
witnessed the attacks on the World Trade Center on 911 i was employed there and I
saw unfortunately the events unfold so I was sitting there for various
reasons and one of the reasons was thinking about my past and the fact that
I was formerly employed there and thinking about my present and what was actually occurring and being that
yesterday was Memorial Day it's something that carries a lot of weight in most Americans minds including my
own now the reason why I'm mentioning this is because and I apologize if it
sounds a bit uh far-fetched I heard an individual who
works as an information agent and another individual who works as a security guard
say various times that uh I would be
attacked for being a cisgender male and I didn't quite understand this there's a lot of racial bias going on there's a
lot of hate crimes going on in New York i've seen many things happen and I unfortunately I've been attacked many
times on on the street uh for the last 10 years i've gone to the police i've
spoken to the DOI i've spoken to uh Joselyn Strober uh inspectors at the DOI
etc over and over again for the last almost 10 years now and I have
documented proof if you need it uh and so I'm mentioning this at this
testimonial to address the fact that uh what I still call the prison industrial
complex being funded by legislation I believe is using
collisional data and information that is being used to provide that funding and
what is not being said at this hearing are the other important factors that are affecting every American's rights
including illegals including migrants who want to become American citizens sir could you please wrap up your testimony
sure and and live in this country so I can't go into the
rest what is troubling me is that is this how the American economy is being
run meaning this is how we're funding the prison industrial complex i
believe that a lot of the violence that is occurring in this country uh is not being handled properly a lot
of what I heard today the testimony that I heard today and the people who are trying to protect the rights of illegals
and migrants I understand but the climate of violence and fear that is
currently plaguing our country is quite another thing up your testimony you're now over time and just out of respect
for other people waiting online as well you can submit any written testimony to
um the gentleman in the back okay all I'd like to say in closing is that I truly believe that needs there needs to
be relegation of the law in order for that funding to be used properly great thank you thank you for your testimony
go ahead sir uh good afternoon my name is Row Vera uh I just want to say before
I read my statement that uh we don't trust the G the NOS's the
nonprofits there's something that's going on with all this money being handing out to uh
immigrants uh the city has spent $6.9 billion and you cannot help immigrants
with $6.9 billion that's very suspect i think uh somebody should look into that
also the chair Az is in the back i'm not sure why she doesn't want to sit down at the chair and and take over her uh her
chair she's You have two minutes look at what she's doing you call you call you call that representation this is coming
out of your two minutes yeah but you you you call that representation right well I'm going to Yeah you could look up for
that $1 billion that's missing on the Thrive NYC that uh we we spoke about you know I asked you to investigate that
that's $1 billion so I'm going to read the a quote from Dr wala Sultan
the trouble with Islam is deeply rooted in its teachings islam is also a
politically ideology that I I'll restart the trouble with Islam is deeply rooted
in its teachings islam is also a political ideology that preaches violence and applies its agenda to
agenda by force i'll remind Chair Ailez that it was Muslims who attacked and
brought down the World Trade Centers on 911 i'll also remind the chair Palestinians were dancing in the streets
of Palestine sir I'm going to need you to stay on topic please we're not here to disparage any religious on topic this
is about immigration i reclaim my time chair Az believes there's no reclamation
thank you chair Az believes that the struggle of Puerto Rico and Palestine are the same i remind the chair Puerto
Rico does not hate America like the Palestinians do and Puerto Rico does not have a terrorist organization called
Hamas you support Zan Mandani for NYC who lied to me about publicly denouncing
Hamas Hezbollah and Sharia law his campaign team said on camera that Mr
mandani put out a statement we demand sir this is not on topic and your time is over we demand he produce the so
thank you for your testimony we'll submit our testimony thank you zoom yep okay now we're moving to Zoom
our first uh first for Zoom is Ari
our first on Zoom is Ariaban you may begin
all right hi good evening everyone can you hear me okay yes go ahead all righty so my name is Ayan Omaragban i'm the New
York policy manager at African Communities Together first and foremost I'd like to say good evening uh Chair
Brandon Chair Ailis and members of the committees on finance and immigration this is actually my first time doing a
virtual testimony i tend to be there every time but thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak so I'm here
today to ask city council to renew $7.8 8 million in funding to the language
access grant to expand vital services ranging from legal and rapid response to
critical community education to help New York's immigrants access resources and and protect their rights um I make this
request in hope and also in expectation that the council will grant a complete
restoration of funding for Afringual New York's first and premier African workerowned language collaborative um
just to give you all some statistics uh according to New York statistics there are estimated
172,712 immigrants from subsaharan Africa living in New York State in New
York City alone there are approximately 86,694 speakers of African languages and
tens of thousands of speakers of French and Arabic many of these African language speakers are limited English
proficient and studies show that African immigrants are among New York's most language isolated communities i think my
colleagues who spoke on the panel earlier from Language Justice Collaborative they talked a lot about
the work that we've been able to do over the last few years we advocated for New York City's local law 30 we pushed for
the passage of New York State legislation um New York State language access law um and last year we also
worked together to lead a successful campaign that resulted in the New York City Council making an unprecedented
investment of 3.8 million in building the language access workforce um you
know we since receiving that funding Afrolingual has been able to provide New Yorkers with time has expired okay could
I just finish this sentence and then Sure go ahead sorry about that so afrilingual you know we've been able to
provide New Yorkers with workerowned language access services interpretation translation and English uh as a second
language instruction the development of this cooperative has also empowered the economic uplift of African immigrants
living in the city so as everyone knows this is a very scary time and you know there's no moment like now to continue
to provide that funding for language access work so thank you again for your time and um have a good evening everyone
and I'll provide the rest in our written um testimony thank you thank you now we have Danielle Gerard you may begin
uh thank you Chair Nurse Chair Brandon and uh Chair Ales and committee
members my name is Danielle Gerard i'm a senior staff attorney at Children's Rights a member of the New York City Jail's Action Coalition we advocate for
young adults on Rikers and we support closing Rikers thank you for your efforts to rightsize the
administration's lopsided budget please continue to focus on budget priorities that improve the lives of our
incarcerated neighbors and other desperate New Yorkers funding 1100 additional correction officers to add to
the bloated DOC budget makes no sense given absenteeism and lack of accountability among current staff for
that $150 million the city could fund housing community-based mental health care ATIs and re-entry programs and more
we need less DOC staff for a smaller jail system not to continue
incarcerating mentally ill and marginalized members of our communities on the humanitarian disaster that is
Rikers we urge you to continue to put social services at the forefront of any budget expenditures every dollar spent
on those services does a lot more to increase real public safety than locking up thousands of people at an
astronomical cost and while you are at it please make our jails as humane as possible with meaningful programming
educational opportunities recreation and enough food so that people don't go to bed hungry on top of timely and quality
medical and mental health care we urge you to consider the testimony that we submitted on March 7th for your
preliminary budget hearing it explains in detail how children's rights believes the city's criminal legal budget
priority should be realigned to fulfill these objectives thank you for your work and thank you for holding these hearings
thank you very much now we have Donna Hilton
good afternoon can everyone hear me yes go ahead all right thank you thank you
uh council for having uh this hearing and having me present at this hearing my apologies for not being in person but
I'm out here boots on the ground i'm Donna Hilton i am the founder and president of A Little Piece of Light we
are women led organizations that focuses on the gaps that continue to exist with people that have been traumatized and
that includes which I've not really heard so much about right now at this hearing today trans uh people black uh
women black girls people who are have been in our military who continue to uh
face obstacles and and and issues and I just want to focus really quickly like my colleague said earlier the $1.5
billion dollars that's being allocated to the Department of Corrections to continue uh
uh a climate of violence and just lack of um support and and services that
people who have I I've identified really need and so we've been fighting for a
few years now just to get 10% allocated 10% of that budget so we can continue to
support the most marginalized of communities that that permeate our city
we deal with people that are in Brooklyn Queens uh Manhattan Staten Island the
Bronx and all over New York and we continue to have the least amount of services especially for women right now
we have a housing initiative that's being shut down as I speak i have to close them down because we don't have
that support we have been instrumental with the closure of Rikers and getting uh receiverhip we've also been
instrumental with passing the largest parole legislation in the country to shut down six prisons and to release
those people from out from custody who do not need to be incarcerated and so
I'm saying here today that we need to focus there needs to be a stronger focus on boots on the ground organizations
that are out there in the streets doing this work daily responding having Thank you for
your testimony your time has expired thank you
okay next we have Natalie Jammies or James
you may begin
okay now we have Sophie Guru you may begin
thank you all for the opportunity to testify hi my name is Sophia Gurule and I am a trustee and constitutional
officer elected unionwide by the workers of the association of legal advocates and attorneys United Auto Workers Local
2325 which represents over 3,400 legal services workers including immigration legal services workers at the three
knifup organizations the Bronx Defenders Brooklyn Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society UAW 2325 supports the three
knifup organizations in their request to double knife funding from 5.5 million per organization to 11.0 06 million per
organization as a UAW2325 elected leader as a line staff attorney in the New York
Immigrant Family Unity Project I'm here to emphasize the dire need for increased Knif funding i have worked as a senior
staff attorney in Nifup since September 2017 though I testified today in my
individual union capacity and not on behalf of my employer the Bronx Defenders my testimony today is based on
my nearly eight years of experience representing detained and non-detained New Yorkers facing deportation under three different presidential
administrations currently the UAW is hemormer he hemorrhaging legal services workers whose expertise is in detained
and non-detained removal defense the UAW has lost approximately 20 immigrant legal services workers at the Bronx
Defenders in less than two years for context that is nearly half of the current staffing numbers in the immigration practice with my nearly
eight years of experience I'm somehow the most senior staff attorney working in KNUP at the Bronx Defenders which
often shocks my union siblings in different practice areas at organizations like the Illegal Aid Society however high knife worker
turnover is avoidable our ability to stay in KNUP depends on having manageable case loads and salaries that
allow us to afford our rent and bills including our student loan payments our wins as unionized workers are wins for
the poor and working-class citywide union and non-union alike when workers working conditions thrive the community
thrives so when any of the knifeup organizations lose these workers that means immigrant New Yorkers who depend
on essential deportation defense legal services are not receiving the most experienced advocates or the most
consistent legal thank you for your testimony your time has expired often last years can I finish my remarks sure
go ahead so this is when workers leave that case load is then off offloaded to committed
advocates but those advocates are increasingly overburdened less familiar with the nuances of that person's case
and who are doing their best to stay informed and on top of rapidly changing immigration law and policy changes i can
personally attest it is extremely challenging every time a worker leaves providing stable legal services
is essential to ensure immigrant New Yorkers are materially supported against an explicitly hostile Trump
administration our work keeps families together it keeps essential caretakers employed it ensures immigrant New
Yorkers have a consistent legal team to call upon when the Trump administration finds new fun creative ways to terrorize
people new Yorkers need experienced attorneys attorneys parallegal social workers because an experienced knife
advocate necessarily means retaining a knowledgeable fearless and creative advocate i can send the rest of my
written testimony um later but I do want to invite any of you from the city council to you know witness and observe
knife up in action it's very easy to do you can uh go to the virtual courtrooms you can watch any of us you can reach
out to anyone at the UAW and we can connect you to making that possible um I
really highly recommend it it's essential to understand just how essential our our work is you can
observe bond hearings you can observe deportation trials or you could just sit a day in the virtual immigration
courtroom of immigration judge Charles Conroy who's often required to handle the proate cases before a knife attorney
is ever actually assigned so I'm happy to answer questions i know I'm well beyond my time and I'll I'll be providing the rest of my written
testimony thank Thank you very much
okay now we have Christopher Leon Johnson you may begin yeah um hello chairs abil nurse and
chair Brandon my name is Christopher Leon Johnson so I'm here to show my support to the Wolf for Justice Project and the Street Vender Project with their
um funding request u they they deserve the money i hope they don't get cut off this FY26 cycle i know it's going on
internally but they shouldn't be cut off this um cycle while at the same time I'm supporting uh their fight against the
NYPD with this ticket situation um I understand that it's a ebike crisis in
the city of New York but they shouldn't be the delivery should be criminalized i'm calling on the city council to find
a way to work with the NYPD compromise with the NYPD to put exemptions for
deliveristas when they do deliveries on an ebike they shouldn't be criminalized for um delivering uh food and medicine
um I know I know a lot of people that are sick and medicine is more viable than food and it shouldn't be where
somebody couldn't get their medicine because somebody got a summon or to the point that one of these liberties got arrested because some of them are really
language barrier with Spanish and Africans and they don't know the language so at the same time I'm calling
on the city council to observe to give the work of justice project um second English funding and streaming the
private funding at the same time I'm calling on you three um Brandon Ales and a nurse to hope you guys if you have
time on those tomorrow stated Wednesday to show tomorrow for the press conference out on CEO steps um for the
deliveristas and the street project so on their Instagram page and their Twitter page so I hope you guys show up at that press conference and rally and

before we begin I want to acknowledge the life of Congressman Charlie Wrangler

fought for this country in the Korean War and dedicated his life to fighting for working families in our city and our
country he was the first black chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and a force representing New York City and
Congress for decades i was honored to know him his legacy will continue to
live on in our city and within all of us who were influenced by him i also want to acknowledge the
unimaginable tragedy that took place last Wednesday when Yuron Lashinski and
Sarah Mgram two workers at the Israeli embassy were killed in a horrific anti-semitic attack no one should be the
target of violence due to their religion background or beliefs and our Jewish
community like all communities deserve to be safe we must continue to work
together to root out anti-semitism in all forms of hate my heart and prayers
are with Iran and Sarah's families and communities who must now carry the unbearable weight of their
losses earlier this month our city lost members of our own workforce anthony
Austin affectionately known as Tony served NYC media for 20 years as a

amplifying under reppresented voices especially those in our black and Latino communities he leaves behind his wife
Natalia and his children Derry Michael Mateos and Christina tony's presence his

with his peers and colleagues and my heart goes out to all of his loved ones his family and his entire team at NYC

Raymond Fes a D engine engineer who died over the weekend after an explosion on
board a barge in the Hudson River we also mourn the lives of two construction workers who died while on

they navigate this tragedy my thoughts are with all of the families and loved
ones who are grieving today this week is the final week of our
executive budget hearings for fiscal year 2026 and I want to thank all council
members and their staff for their hard work throughout this budget process thus far a special thanks goes to our finance
chair Justin Brandon for his leadership all of our committee chairs and our finance division for their commitment
throughout these weeks of hearings and to the members of the public who offered testimony thank you for your continued
engagement and sharing your input through this process to help us advance a better budget for our city as we
continue our negotiations with the mayoral administration the council will push forward to secure a budget that
addresses the needs of New Yorkers there is still significant work to be done to
fill in the gaps in funding for programs left out of the executive budget throughout our hearings we identified
outstanding funding gaps and heard from New Yorkers across the city who rely on adequate city services to safely and
successfully continue living in our city we must continue we must ensure that New
York City is a place where all our fellow neighbors regardless of income background or experience build healthy
and productive lives may 19th was Malcolm X day and would have been his 100th birthday we honor
his legacy immense contributions and fight for justice and equity which we celebrated here in chambers on the

our EMS workers for their dedication to our communities including and especially my own daughter Aliyah who proudly
serves our city as an FDNY paramedic last Sunday was the fifth
anniversary of George Floyd's murder we must recommmit ourselves to the fight for justice and to advance policies that
keep all of us safe while this council has championed reforms that prioritize the safety and dignity of all people we
know that there is far more that must be done to secure the just future that all of us
deserve we also observed Memorial Day on Monday to honor and commemorate service
members who paid the ultimate sacrifice and service to our country my father my
father-in-law and my husband all served in the Air Force and I know many of you

you to our staff members Natasha Bin I'm Sierra Towns and Andrew Bourne Ricky Chala and Austin Malone thank you so
much for your attention now I will turn it back over to our majority leader thank you Speaker Adams uh we have a
quorum now and we have to maintain said quorum in order to conduct all business in today's meeting no member is allowed
to leave the chamber floor additionally no member virtually can participate if quorum is not maintained on the floor we
will now move into the discussion of general orders i'd like to first recognize council member Kaban followed
by Williams and Hudson
thank you never been called first majority leader caught me off guard
um I I want to talk about uh the intro 1148 the Receipts Act this legislation
marks an important step toward greater transparency accountability and trust in our city's public benefits system
the Receipts Act ensures that applicants for key benefits like cash assistance oneshot deals and food stamps receive an
application confirmation notice when they apply this notice will indicate whether the application is complete and
if not what steps remain it also requires that applicants receive a detailed receipt after submitting
documents including the date type of documents and the purpose of submission these may seem like minor procedural
updates but for those seeking vital support they can mean the difference between clarity and confusion between
getting help and falling through the cracks for too long navigating public benefits has been a frustrating and
opaque process have often left without
documentation of their status and this bill tackles that issue with clear common sense solutions and it was crafted to serve and uplift New Yorkers
by my constituent services director Melissa Korea so shout out to her uh and my legislative director Jonah Burch uh
and also thank you to all of the constituent service teams uh in all of my colleagues offices chronic
underfunding and understaffing at agencies like DSS have left too many New Yorkers struggling to access life-saving
services during times of need the Receipts Act is about restoring dignity to a system that has left many feeling
powerless it ensures people have the tools to advocate for themselves and ensures that the government serves New Yorkers better i thank the advocate
service providers and New Yorkers who share their stories and made clear how urgently this change was needed um and I
look forward to working with DSS and H to implement this legislation effectively and thoughtfully together we
can ensure the Receipts Act fulfills its promise a benefit system that better serves the people so thank you again to
my colleagues for supporting this vital measure recognizing Council Member Williams followed by Hudson the nurse
thank you so much Madam Majority Leader for decades home owners in Southeast Queens have lived with the consequences
of a problem most New Yorkers have never heard of groundwater flooding this issue
began decades ago as changes to the area's natural water table followed the closure of local wells and shifts in
landmines unlike storm driven flooding groundwater flooding happens slowly and
silently damaging basements boilers and foundations without warning it's a
problem my constituents of Southeast Queens know all too well intro 1067B
brings much needed focus and coordination to an issue that has gone unressed for far too long it ensures the
city is collecting data paying attention to the patterns and beginning to understand the full scope of groundwater
flooding across all five burrows and for southeast Queens where residents have dealt with this quietly for years 1067b
creates a path forward toward coordinating long-term solutions this includes the creation of a dedicated
task force charged with centering the lived experiences of Southeast Queens residents and recommending practical
strategies for adaptation and relief and for all New Yorkers this bill will help
guide smarter more informed planning and investments across our city this is what
responsive community rooted government looks like i really want to thank Speaker Adrienne Adams uh who also
represents Southeast Queens uh for her leadership and my council colleagues especially chair Jim Janeiro who has
been a long advocate on groundwater flooding in Southeast Queens for standing with us and every New Yorker
with the quiet crisis of groundwater flooding and I really want to just give a special shout out to the legislative
division Natasha and Andrew uh because they worked really hard to make this a
bill that we can legally pass it's very difficult and complicated so I really want to thank them for their dedication
to bringing this across the finish line thank you
recognizing Council Member Hudson followed by nurse then Oay good afternoon and thank you Madam Majority
Leader i'm proud to stand today and speak for no more than two minutes about the Atlantic Avenue mixeduse plan also
known as AMUP that we're voting on today it's the culmination of more than a decade of advocacy from local residents
and nearly three years of public engagement hard work and tireless negotiations central Brooklyn is finally
getting the community-led resoning it has long demanded aimup will bring 4,600
new homes to central Brooklyn 40% of which will be affordable for low and moderate income New Yorkers along with
more than 215 million in dedicated funding for infrastructure upgrades park
and playground renovations funding for local hiring programs as well as resources for tenant and homeowner
protections and so much more for our communities with this community-led resoning we're tackling several major
crises facing our city a housing shortage dangerous streets and the urgent need for good paying jobs
accessible to all New Yorkers regardless of education level this process shows what's possible when planning is led by
the community and backed by political will we can build more affordable housing and deliver real lasting
benefits to neighborhoods across the city thank you to the communities of Prospect Heights Crown Heights Fort
Green Clinton Hill and Bedford Stson for envisioning a better future for Atlantic Avenue and to the many city agencies and
council staff who worked tirelessly to get us here and of course a huge thank you to my partner in this work Council
Member Chio who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with me throughout this process and whose relentless advocacy and steadfast leadership help
us across the finish line i've also made my Chio video debut so if you haven't seen it yet go check it out i urge my
colleagues to vote yes on AMUP and that I hope and I hope that more communities across the city begin the deep consensus
building work needed to bring about more affordable housing safer streets better parks and stronger neighborhoods thank
you recognizing Council Member Nurse
followed by Oay thank you majority leader i too have had
a Chio video debut um uh today we are voting on my bill
intro 1037 the rent transparency act the bill will require signage in the common
areas of all buildings subject to the rent stabilization law that notifies tenants that one or more units in the
building are rent stabilized the sign will direct them to the New York State Department of Homes and Community
Renewal website where they can request their rental history the bill also alerts tenants that their landlords may
be subject to fines if they do not register their units with DHCR many tenants living in rent stabilized units
don't know how to determine their legal rent and in turn bad landlords have gotten away with illegal rent
overcharges and have illegally deregulated units and whole buildings the Rent Transparency Act acts as a
counter to this information gap and makes it clear that landlords with apartment units that are out of compliance can face fines rent
overcharge complaints have increased from 500 annually just a few years ago to over 900 last year and this is just
from tenants who took action there are probably thousands who didn't and as we continue to lose New Yorkers to the
astounding cost of living rising rents remain a top concern for millions of New Yorkers let's help relieve just some of
the burden on tenants by giving them some clarity and passing the Rent Transparency Act thank you to Ryan
Hickey Patricia Santana Elliot Elliot Heisler Austin Malone and the housing legal services providers colleagues I
ask you for your vote in favor of this bill thank you Majority Leader recognizing Council Member Oce today we
are voting on a plan that meets the urgency of the moment the Atlantic Avenue mixeduse plan Aimup will unlock
4,600 new homes across community districts 3 and 8 and 1,900 of them will
be incomerestricted that's a large and necessary amount of new homes and more incomerestricted housing than this than
this area has produced in the entire last decades through AUP 40% of units will be permanently incomerestricted and
100% will be adding to New York's desperately low housing supply putting downward pressure on rents for everyone
behind beyond the necessary homes this plan unlocks we have secured historic neighborhood investment $215 million for
safer streets enhanced infrastructure and vibrant parks this includes long needed improvements to St andrews John
Hancock and PTOAC playgrounds we are redesigning the stretch of Atlantic so kids can cross in safety seniors can
stroll without fear and small businesses can flourish along a calmer greener corridor additionally after 30 long
years we are going to address the homeownership and ownership issues surrounding Hattie Jones Court and Juel
McCoy Lane this is the first step to bringing key repairs and improvements to the streets and because housing justice
includes looking out for everyone we locked in $1.2 2 million for full-time tenant and homeowner legal assistance
right in our district offices plus citywide resources like partners in preservation and the anti-harassment
tenant program so no one can bully our neighbors out of their homes some will ask why build so much my answer is
simple displacement is not a force of nature it is a policy choice when we deprive our city of new homes rents
skyrocket and families are pushed out when we say yes to new homes to income restricted homes to making room for
everyone so no one is priced out we choose community over scarcity and inclusion over exclusion this plan also
invests in a workforce development program so the jobs of tomorrow go to the people who live here today it even
begins the long-awaited revival of the Bedford Atlantic Armory with AMUP we prove that Brooklyn's future can be
abundant equitable prosperous alive and ours i thank our council's land use team
for shephering us through endless negotiations and reviews the department of city planning and other agencies for
taking our community's feedback seriously and to our neighbors who helped us shape this plan and emp
emphasize the need for real affordable housing in the district thank you thank you council member Hudson my amazing staff May Verang Batana Elijah
Fox as well as the speaker thank you very much seeing no one else signed up to speak

enforcement by the department of sanitation will ensure that cars actually move for alternate side parking
um when street sweepers uh you know go around our communities they pick up a
ton of garbage on average per route but they can't clean up our streets if they can't reach the curb which then leads to
more garbage which leads to more rats which undermines our quality of life this is a smart uh and effective use of

like to thank council members O Rivera Menan Kaban for introducing this
resolution alongside me and chairs Delarosa and Lewis for seeing the bill
through committee most of us myself included use streaming platforms as our
primary way of listening to so music the songs that we stream soundtrack our
lives but the popularity of music streaming platforms has not benefited the artists that make the songs we
listen to currently the average recording artist receives less than a third of a penny when someone streams
their song on Spotify these low rates of pay make it incredibly difficult for musicians to ek out a living we all know
that New York City makes the best music in the entire world if we want to keep it that way we have to make sure
musicians can make enough money to live here the living wage
you can continue i I have like two paragraphs council member Hanei if you have to wrap

nay any abstensions the eyes have it we will now
move into general discussion and I'd like to first recognize Majority Whip Brooks Powers followed by Council Member
Lewis Venowitz thank you and today I'm introducing two important pieces of
legislation first I'm introducing a bill that would require the city to conduct a
re recurring environmental impact study of JFK airport operations in southeast
Queens for far too long residents in communities like mine have lived with the daily impacts of noise and air
pollution from airport traffic without adequate monitoring transparency or
mitigation this bill directs the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to work with city agencies to collect
data on Sergeants please hold the time folks that are leaving the chambers please do so
quietly you can continue this bill directs the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability to
work with city agencies to collect data on air quality noise and health outcomes
consult with local environmental justice groups and publish regular public reports it also requires the city to
recommend and implement programs that reduce environmental harm and to engage the Port Authority on needed changes to
the JFK lease agreement if we are serious about environmental justice we
must back that up with data and action this legislation ensures that environmental concerns in Southeast
Queens are taken seriously i'm also proud to introduce a resolution in support of two critical state bills
senate Bill 1244 Assembly Bill 1587 and Senate Bill
7275A in the assembly bill accompanying that is 5341A which would strengthen sighting
rules for cannabis storefronts and advertising these bills would increase the minimum distance between cannabis
businesses and sensitive sites like schools playgrounds libraries and houses of worship while also clarifying how
those distances are measured we must ensure legis legalization does not come
at the expense of the community well-being i urge the state legislature to pass these bills and the governor to
sign them into law thank you recognizing Council Member Lewis followed by Denowitz the
nurse thank you Madam Majority Leader today I'm proud to introduce three important pieces of legislation each of
which reflect on commitment to equity transparency and accessibility for all New Yorkers the first resol calls on the
state and governor to pass legislation that would require employers to disclose all forms of compensation including
bonuses stock options and commissions while salary transparency laws have moved us in the right direction too many
workers are still left negotiating in the dark employees deserve to understand the full scope of what they are being
offered without clear information on total compensation workers especially women of color and people of color
remain at a disadvantage when negotiating pay full transparency is essential to achieving real pay equity
the second intro 1286 addresses the responsible placement of adult use
cannabis dispensaries it would prohibit any dispensary from operating within 500 ft of a public youth facility as the
legal cannabis market continues to grow it is important that we implement thoughtful regulations that consider the
needs of young people the last intro 1287 part of the Wheel Deal package in
partnership with Council Member Marte requires the current bike share program to offer a discounted rate to public
school students who are 16 years of age or older for many young people bike share programs provide a critical link
to school work and other opportunities by removing financial barriers we are helping students move more freely
through the city and encouraging sustainable healthy modes of transportation each of these bills address a different challenge New
Yorkers are experiencing i urge my colleagues to support these bills and to help move our city forward thank you
recognizing Council Member Denowitz followed by nurse then Ables thank you Madam Majority Leader uh good afternoon
colleagues today I'm introducing Bill 1281 of 2025 a bill that addresses
really an urgent financial matter facing countless tenants and shareholders our
constituents and I'm proud to stand with council members Botcher and Holder Holden in support of this measure uh
this legislation 1281 amends local law 157 of 2016 which mandates natural gas
detectors in hotels and residential buildings the Department of Buildings set a compliance deadline of May 1st
which is obviously passed and the intent of local law 157 is sound it's to protect residents from gas leaks but
this May 1 deadline is utterly unachievable yet despite this
unachievable deadline the fines for New Yorkers our constituents will begin to
mount 18 of us even outlined some of these these obstacles in our April letter uh to the Department of Buildings
Commissioner uh the market lacks compliant devices they do not exist our
law requires detectors to meet NFPA standard 715 of 2023 only one
manufacturer has produced a compliant device however this company has faced crippling supply chain issues preventing
timely orders worse the sole compliant device has been massively recalled due
to a critical malfunction that prevents it from alerting consumers to gas leaks
the one otherwise viable option is now off the shelves and even if devices uh were available compliant installation of
plug-in models is often impossible in New York City apartments they're required to be 3 to 10 feet horizontally
of an appliance and within 12 in of a ceiling and most of us don't have outlets near the ceiling the consequence
is clear new Yorkers will be unjustly fined for failing to meet a mandate that is quite literally impossible to fill
this bill 1281 simply postpones the mandate requiring alarms one year after the Department of Buildings confirms
devices are sufficiently available i encourage everyone to join us in co-sponsoring this common sense bill
1281 to shield New Yorkers from our unwarranted fines and to ensure true safety remains our paramount goal thank
you Madam Majority Leader recognizing Council Member Nurse followed by Azen Gutierrez
thank you Majority Leader today I'm introducing Intro 1294 a bill that names and shames deed thieves when it comes to
crime we are quick to post photos of people who steal diapers and baby formula from Wraid but when it comes to
the parasites who commit deed fraud and destabilize entire neighborhoods they often escape public scrutiny since 2014
there have been over 3,000 deed fraud complaints and those are just the cases we know about with the number likely
being much higher these thieves prey on older adults particularly black elders
people falling behind on their property or water taxes and families facing foreclosure they exploit moments of
financial stress and vulnerability to rob people of the American dream they
are white collar thugs enriching themselves at the expense of those who are most vulnerable this bill would send
a warning that we will catch you we will shame you and we will make sure every New Yorker sees your name your face and
your identifying information we will expose we will expose these criminals
who go on to often reaffend and who are helped by being able to hide behind LLC's and a veil of secrecy while the
council has invested in estate planning and foreclosure prevention and legal services for older adults more must be
done i thank Council Member Chio and Brooklyn Burough President Antonio Reynoso for co-primeing this bill and I
urge you all to sign on to it thank you Majority Leader recognizing Council Member Az followed
by Gutierrez and Salam
thank you Majority Leader today I'm introducing a resolution 870 alongside
council member de la Rosa and council member Joseph which would establish May in New York City schools as labor
history month while New York City is still a union town with the highest union density rate in all of the country
it probably doesn't come as a surprise to many of you that union membership has been steadily declining since the 70s
this is something we need to fix and if we have any hope at all of addressing
inequity with so much of our education system focused on job readiness and career prep for young people little to
no work has been done to prepare our future workforce to understand and protect their rights and guard
themselves against exploitation both now and in the future and now with
anti-immigrant sentiment at fever pitch states like Florida looking to child
labor law looking to roll back child labor laws to fill labor shortages
created by the fulfillment of their own racist fantasies to deport all brown people while it might seem that this
trend is new as of the most recent Trump administration a 2023 study by the
Economic Policy Institute revealed that 10 states have introduced legislation to
weaken child labor standards dismantling gains made over a century ago after the
triangle shirt waist fire such loosening of these critical laws not only leaves
our children vulnerable but creates opportunities to further dismantle unions and exacerbate inequality
nurturing young people to understand their inherent dignity is one of the greatest investments we can make to
ensure more just and equitable future i encourage all my colleagues to sign on
to this resolution and hope that our state will follow California in ensuring that this is part of our curriculum
thank you for your consideration recognizing Council Member Gutierrez followed by Salam then Brewer thank you
Madam Majority Leader today I'm proud to introduce two bills rooted in a shared principle that is of protecting New
Yorkers first I'm introducing the Safe Pregnancy and Opioid Treatment Act a bill that would require the health
department to educate providers on how to safely treat opioid use disorder during and after pregnancy and provide
Narcan at specific sites a report by the DOH recorded uh 241 deaths within a
5-year period um with approximately one in seven of those deaths attributed to overdoses more than 3/4ers of which
involved opioids this is a harm reduction bill a maternal health bill a
common sense public health bill and it's one that will save lives especially for the pregnant New Yorkers who have been
suffering in silence and ignored because of stigmas that might exist i also just want to thank uh Council Member Hanks
and uh Chair Schulman who have already co-sponsored this bill um Speaker Adams
and this council have put maternal mortal mortality front and center we're not afraid to be honest and have painful
conversations um when needed to put an end to these preventable deaths thank you to the speaker of course for her
support and contributions to this bill the second bill I'm introducing is the Fair Business B business practices act
resolution that calls on the state to finally outlaw unfair and abusive business practices right now New York
lags behind 42 other states in protecting consumers small businesses and nonprofits from scams junk fees and
AIdriven fraud i want to thank Attorney General Leticia James for her leadership on this bill i encourage all of my
colleagues to sign on and join me in protecting New Yorkers thank you recognizing Council Member Salam
followed by Brewer then Narcissis

express condolences to the family of Tom Robbins a reporter an investigative reporter for many years and he passed
last night um I want to mention reszo number 882 it is a resolution that talks
about Cuba um you probably know in ' 62 Kennedy issued a proclamation on the
trade embargo and then Obama opened up Cuba in uh 21 and of course Trump closed
it in um the Biden administration kept it going after it was closed by Trump
first time around biden opened it up a week before he left office and of course on January 20th Trump uh reinstated the
uh trade embargo i mention all this because the only other countries that have this trade embargo are Syria Iran
and North Korea and it seems to me that um the work that we are doing in this
country would fit well with Cuba and I would like to say that it should not be a state sponsor of terrorism um and on
that list were those other three countries that I mentioned thank you very much
recognizing Council Member Narcissis followed by Russler then Millie
thank you Madam Chair and thank you Madam Speaker for your leadership for far too long the people of Karsi have
been left behind when it comes to transit access my district is a transit desert and our residents students
working families seniors people with disabilities deserve more reliable and
accessibility transportation we need that in Kari i don't want to keep taking
too long but 1293 understand where we live in the South Brooklyn we cannot get
here it takes us about hour and a half and we talking about environmental problem we're talking about climate
change we need a break from Canari to get a ferry so Karsi once had a ferry
service and it's time we bought it back a ferry would give residents more ways
to get where they need to go while also helping to revitalize a pier that we
have that could truly use the boost right now it is viable transit option
and is an investment for the city and is a beautiful waterfront where everybody can enjoy i also proud to introduce and
I have to say thank you to Flossy that been standing with me for decades i'm also proud to introduce legislation that
will require the department of health and mental hygiene to launch a public
information and outreach campaign when it come to uterine fib um fibrosis
fibroid is real for a lot especially black women this is a condition that affects million of women especially when
we come to our community we know how health um inequities going throughout so
please my colleagues look into it by increasing that by increas by addressing
um fibrosis it will help a lot of women in our community our neighbors our
friends our sisters and brothers I urge my colleague to support this legislation it's about time and I'm also proud to
introduce a resolution calling on the state to require private de I mean developers of battery energy storage
system to carry liability insurance and provide financial support to nearby
homeowners in the event of a battery our time to clean energy must
never come at the expense of public safety council member Narc has expired
thank you so much council Member Wrestler thank you very much Madam Majority Leader uh I firstly just want
to echo Council Member Brewer's sentiments about the passing of Tom Robbins tom was one of the truly great
investigative journalists in our city uh for many years at the Village Voice more recently at the city uh he was be behind
that uh Eric Adams table of success linked all of the various corrupt actors
in the Adams orbit to the mayor um he was for many years a professor of
journalism at at the CUNI uh journalism school um he was the very first person
to say to me that Adrienne Adams should be our next mayor three years ago um he was a tenacious brilliant and savvy
journalist uh he held the powers that be accountable uh and he will be missed
dearly he was a constituent and somebody who I admired immensely um I also am very proud to be introducing legislation
today of which the number I do not know um but the bill uh creates a cooling off
period for the most powerful folks that enter into city service essentially this would uh prohibit employees with
substantial policymaking discretion senior staff at city hall agency heads etc from participating in determining
policy for any previous employer that they had worked for for the previous two years it would apply to lobbyists and
their clients to law firms and the the clients that lawyers represented uh it
is important that we close the revolving door in city government between lobbying
and public service and we passed legislation earlier this year to shut the revolving door on the way out for
people like Frank Coron when they leave city service but it's important that we also shut that door for the people entering in so they don't do favors for
the lobbying firms and the companies that they previously worked for when they enter into the public sector uh and
I hope my colleagues will in sponsor whatever the bill number is and I trust you all will figure it out thank you
1295 recognizing council member followed by Hanife good afternoon speaker Adams and

550 which we passed in 2023 as someone living with lupus I want to honor my
fellow lupus warriors across New York City each of us carries a different story but we all face the reality of
living with an incurable autoimmune disease that's why we need more public
education on lupus symptoms faster diagnosis and better access to
specialists but awareness isn't enough we need policy changes that includes a
fully ADA accessible transit system remote work protections and free public
health care these are not luxuries they're lifesaving i've shared my lupus
journey many times so folks understand why I may take the stairs a little
slower and why I'm so committed to building a caring accessible city living

Christine Ryan Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters Michael Gerber and Deputy Chief Gregory Clifford Commanding
Officer of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning as well as other members of my executive staff thank you
for the opportunity to testify today on the NYPD's fiscal year 2026 executive
budget in March we provided a comprehens we provided comprehensive testimony on many topics ranging from crime reduction
strategies to internal NYPD reforms to public safety legislation today we are
here to provide updates on some of those issues and to discuss more ways that we can work together on behalf of all the
people that we serve major crime in New York City continues to go down in our precincts and our subways and in our
housing developments nypd officers have taken more than 2,000 illegal 2,200
illegal guns off our streets in 2025 and nearly 22,000 since the Adams
administration began this has helped drive down citywide shooting incidents by 20% from this point last year and the
NYPD's work in May has been exceptional we just had the safest Memorial Day weekend in terms of gun violence that
New York City has ever seen with the fewest shootings in recorded history and
zero shootings on that Sunday the first time that has happened in the 32 years
that we have been keeping records and with two full days remaining in the month we are on track to have the fewest
murders and the fewest shootings for any May on record this is the result of
smart strategy thoughtful execution precise analysis and 49,000 people all
focused on one thing public safety and that focus on crime fighting is at the heart of our summer violence reduction
plan this plan continues the work that has made our neighborhood subways and housing development safer through the
expansion of our citywide zones as we have seen over the past several months
this datadriven scalpel approach works throughout our zone deployments in some
of our city's most violent areas major crime is down nearly 20% year-to- date
now we have expanded and repositioned our deployments based on current data crime trends and community concerns the
result is 70 summer zones covering 57 different commands across all five
bureaus this is the largest deployment of its kind in department history 1,500
uniformed officers on footposts in precincts public housing and in our subways and all of them focused on high
priority index crimes and shootings the summer is just getting underway but the
early results of this plan are quite promising since May 5th major crime in
our summer zones during deployment is down nearly 30% with double-digit decreases in robbery felony assault
burglary grand lararseny and autotheft shootings are down more than 57% and
major subway crime within these zones is down 29% just as I loed the NYPD successes
fighting crime I'm equally candid about the challenges that we still face whether it is surging recidivism faults
in the discovery law or the proliferation of illegal firearms we must deal with every issue directly and
honestly and that includes juvenile gun violence two weeks ago a 16-year-old
girl was killed by a stray bullet fired into a group of children by a 14-year-old boy who was handed the gun
by a 13-year-old boy it was a tragedy but it was not an aberration from 2018
to 2024 the number of children under the age of 18 arrested with a gun increased by
136% new York City over the same time shooters under the age of 18 went up by
92% and young shooting victims increased 81% why what happened among the factors
the first part of New York state's raise the age law took effect in 2018 the legislation changed both the age of
criminal responsibility and the way teenage offenders are processed in the courts the idea behind this was one that
we can all agree with children should not be treated like adults in our criminal justice system but as the law
took effect here's what we saw when the age of criminal responsibility went up the age of criminal suspects went down
gangs and crews began recruiting younger and younger members and had them carry
the guns and commit the shootings the robberies the
assaults now it's 60% and we cannot forget when more
shooters are kids more shooting victims are kids too this is serious and
seriously bad things come from a consequence-free environment over the
next year we need to have honest conversations about how the criminal justice system deals with youth offenders because the current trajectory
is unsustainable and unsafe i do not come here with all the answers but I do
look forward to working with the council on effective youth strategies in the first quarter of this year shootings in
New York City fell to their lowest level ever we had the second fewest homicides in recorded history there were
double-digit crime declines across patrol transit and housing the public safety gains made by the men and women
of the NYPD were truly historic but even as crime and violence fell New Yorkers were telling us they still did not feel
safe chronic conditions in their neighborhoods like abandoned vehicles homeless encampments illegal parking
unreasonable noise public drinking and urination and open air drug markets give the impression of chaos and disorder
they make people feel unsafe and calls to 311 concerning quality of life issues
nearly doubled in the past six years so in direct response to these increased 311 complaints the NYPD launched the
quality of life division in midappril reentering our approach to public
safety across six commands helping to clear block driveways and bike lanes settle noise complaints and keep our
public spaces safe and orderly and they have ensured that these issues are addressed promptly and do not languish
for days this work is having a real impact in less than six weeks the quality of life division has seized more
than 200 illegal mopeds and rec recklessly operated
ebikes derelict or unregistered vehicles cleared around 440 encampments and
inspected more than 400 smoke shops padlocking around 50 of them in 2025
quality of life enforcement is not about preventing more serious crime in fact it is not about crime at all it is about
improving quality of life being responsive to community complaints and fixing the very real issues people are
dealing with every day including out of control ebikes every person is obligated
to follow the very basic rules of the road when it comes to traffic safety compliance is not optional we will not
tolerate ebikes driving recklessly running red lights ignoring stop signs driving on the sidewalk and riding
against traffic residents have consistently raised fears about serious injury or worse and this enforcement
initiative is in direct response to those clear concerns and the enforcement
looks different now for one simple reason our previous approach wasn't working b summones returnable to traffic
court are part of a regulatory framework designed for licensed car drivers if you
ignore a B summon you have your license suspended if you are a menace on the roads and accumulate enough points on
your license it will be suspended none of this makes any sense for ebikes because a license is not required to
operate one so instead for certain hazardous offenses we are issuing C
summones returnable to criminal law and we are eager to work
with the council and the state legislature on a new meaningful paradigm for biking enforcement but I want to be
clear far from being a war on ebikes this enforcement initiative is designed to keep these vehicles as a viable and
sustainable transportation option in New York City there is a desperate need for
legislative reform to keep pace with the reality on the streets and to the extent
that has not happened yet it is created dangerous conditions the NYPD is is
responsible for keeping people safe consistent with the law and we will continue to do so in 2025 the NYPD has
issued nearly 251,000 summones to cars versus about
5,100 summones to ebikes so clearly this initiative is only one part of our
larger effort to ensure safe streets for all New Yorkers work that is saving lives this year traffic fatalities are
down 24% and collision injuries are down 12% and every vehicle type collision
category is down year to date with one exception and that is ebikes the NYPD
depends on the public trust that trust is built by unimpeachable integrity and it is maintained by strong ethical
leadership over the past five months we have reshaped our executive leadership amended our vehicle pursuit policy
reduced waste and redundancy in our vehicle fleet and returned more than a thousand cops from administrative roles
back to patrol we continue to enhance efficiency appro improve policy and
reinforce accountability when I was last here I said that we were focused on our disciplinary
proing that it is fair and effective that means having an internal affairs
bureau that identifies and re roots out cases of misconduct and having a department advocates office that
prosecutes those cases rigorously it also means that we must have a thorough and consistent process when the CCB
substantiates allegations of misconduct when I started in this position I became
concerned that some of our procedures for CCB cases had come unmed from the
principles that guide our disciplinary system we needed to make changes and we did for example paragraph 2 of our of
our 2012 with the CCB states that when the CCB is seeking charges and
specifications against an officer there are certain circumstances in which the police commissioner can retain
In particular I can take this step when there are ongoing parallel or related criminal investigations or in the
interests of justice when an officer has no disciplinary history or prior substantiated CCB complaints but just
because I can do something does not always mean that I should i am committed
to being thoughtful about when I exercise this authority and I have been last year the department took
year that number is 13 and until a few months ago we were imposing a short so
rule that administratively closed hundreds of CCB cases that came to us shortly before the statute of
limitations expired i ordered the Department Advocates Office to reverse that policy decision and eliminate that
rule my directive is clear cases should not be closed on technicalities and we must make substantial efforts to review
every case brought to us by the CCB in 2024 848 CCB cases were closed because
of short so since we made this change on March 1st there have only been three
going forward that number can be zero and it should be but I want to be clear
the CCB needs to do its part here our department advocates office is making herculean efforts to process cases
quickly in some instances we only have days and this is not fair to the
officers or to the complaintants we urge the CCB to review its own procedures and
to take steps to process cases expeditiously discipline is important
even more important is to improve our practices so that we get it right and that there is no need for discipline my
team is working closely and collaboratively with the federal monitor to achieve the goals of the monitorship
and to ensure that our stop question and frisk practices are constitutionally sound that is why at compliance stat we
are laser focused on the constitutionality of stops frisks and searches conducted by our officers
were lawful compared to 82% in the first quarter we also improved over that time
when it comes to frisks 79% compliance versus 62% and searches 78% compliance
versus 67% through compliance stat we can and will push th those compliance stat rates
even higher when we talk about stops we also must acknowledge long-standing racial disparities the monitor has found
that controlling for various factors such as the crimes being investigated when it comes to a variety of posttop
outcomes such as frisks searches arrests summones use of force and the recovery
of contraband or weapons racial disparities over time have been substantially reduced or been eliminated
entirely for the stops themselves racial disparities remain and we are working
with the monitor to formulate a 14th amendment compliance plan that will tackle that issue head on when it comes
to constitutional policing we are proud of our successes and cleareyed about the challenges that remain we will continue
to identify where we fall short and implement ways to be better new Yorkers
deserve nothing less as you know I am committed to the efficient and appropriate use of overtime at the NYPD
and our overtime management plan is achieving that goal in the first half of fiscal year 2025 the NYPD's overtime
spending was about 11% above the previous year now we have not only
slowed that trend we have reversed it since the plan was implemented each
month has seen significant reductions in overtime spending year-over-year when compared to the same month in 2024
January overtime spending was down 9.7% february was down 10.1% March was
down 14% and April was down 15% you can clearly see the improving
trend as the plan has been honed and refined over time and these res reductions resulted in combined savings
of $40.4 million over the first four months of 2025 compared to last year
overall with this renewed focus and enhanced compliance measures we anticipate that our overtime spending
will be lower than the target established with the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year 2025 and significantly lower than it
would have been if no measures were taken in January to be clear none of
this has come at the expense of public safety we continue to do all the necessary work to reduce crime and
improve quality of life no one does it better than the women and men of the NYPD but it is no secret that we need
more of them and as I have said before this is not a budget problem we have the
will and we have the means but lately we do not have the applicants the result is
an 11% drop in NYPD uniformed headcount over the past seven years it's simple
more cops on patrol make our city safer hiring a thousand recruits in January of this year was a good start but it was
not nearly enough so we expanded our eligibility requirements reducing the number of college credits needed to
apply from 60 down to 24 this brought the NYPD more in line with modern standards since most of our
peer agencies do not require any college credits at all those changes took effect in February and the impact was immediate
in the past few months more than 12,600 new filers have registered to take the police officer exam and more than 4,000
previously ineligible applicants moved to reopen their cases daily applications
are up 75% going from an average of 56 per day up to 98 and about 4,100 people
have registered for the next police exam this gives us a fighting chance to reach Mayor Adams goal of 35,000 uniform
officers by the fall of next year a headcount that we haven't seen since
2022 our department's goal is to hire about 35 new officers in 2025 continuing
the year-over-year increases from the 2041 hires in 2022 2356 in 2023 and 2631
in 2024 this is good news for our city but we kn we need the news to be even
better increased headcount means less overtime less stress in our workforce and better service for New Yorkers i am
confident that we can get there and we appreciate the mayors and the council's support in this effort there are many
other areas as well where the NYPD and the city council can work together to increase public safety and dramatically
improve the quality of life in our city first we propose a change to the administrative code to make it a
misdemeanor to possess an ATV within the confines of New York City though ATVs cannot be legally operated on New York
City roadways they can be legally possessed making enforcement of the law challenging second we need to revisit
the law regarding groups wearing masks in public what was a public health necessity 5 years ago has now become an
easy way for criminals to hide their identities and we cannot allow this to continue the members of the NYPD and the
New York City Council want the same thing a safe city for all whenever possible we should be working together
toward that shared goal and I am eager to partner with you on any policies and legislation get that gets us closer to
achieving it and finally the council has before a bill that would ban the department's criminal group database we
spoke about this at our hearing in March and since then the database has continued to play a critical role in keeping our city safe this intelligence
tool helps us to understand crew related violence and identify potential retaliation targets after a shooting
simply put this investigative tool helps the NYPD save lives we saw this in late
April when we announced a major gang takeown with the Southern District where a long-term investigation led to the
indictment of 27 TDA members on charges including racketeering and sex
trafficking every single person indicted was listed in the database similar gang
cases were recently closed in Queens and Manhattan this year with help from the database including the early May assault
in Times Square against our cops by Los Diablo's a splinter set of TDA several
of those suspects were listed in the database which aided in their swift apprehension i have been clear and
consistent on this if you want to work with us to improve the database we are eager to sit down and discuss this
together but don't eliminate it doing so will make our city and its people less safe now I will speak briefly about a
topic on the minds of many New Yorkers and that is immigration enforcement under city law we are not allowed to
participate in or assist in civil immigration enforcement and we do not we
have been very clear and consistent on this and our officers understand that this is a red line that we cannot cross
at the same time we will continue to target criminals regardless of their immigration status as permitted by law
we work daily on criminal investigations with federal law enforcement through various task forces and that partnership
requires that we share information that is what it means to conduct to conduct a joint investigation and to work
collaboratively with our federal partners some have asked whether we should reconsider our cooperation with
federal agencies on criminal investigations in light of their work with ICE the short straight answer to
this is no working with our federal partners on criminal matters is crucial to the safety of our city we are talking
about cases to protect our city from terrorism saving children from exploitation and sex trafficking and
combating transnational criminal organizations the only way these investigations are successful is by NYPD
detectives working seamlessly with federal agents on a daily basis interfering with that work would be
disastrous for the people of New York City now let me be clear i am nobody's
fool if we were to find that a federal agency had not been honest with us if we
were told that a record's request was for a criminal investigation but in fact that was not true then that would be a
tremendous breach of our trust and we would need to reconsider how we do business with that federal agency i have
been very upfront about that with all of our federal partners but my experience
has been just the opposite we have an incredibly good relationship with our federal partners a relationship built on
mutual respect and trust i know that I value that relationship and I know that my federal counterparts feel the same
way now turning to the mayor's executive budget and its impact on the NYPD in the
coming fiscal year in totality the NYPD's fiscal year 2026 expense budget
is $6.14 billion the vast majority of which or 92% is as allocated for
personnel costs the remaining 8% is dedicated to non-personnel costs which include costs for technology that
provides officers with immediate access to critical data and applications safety equipment our response vehicles and
facilities we are grateful for the additional new funding of 322.9 million included as part of the
executive budget which is for the following in the current fiscal year only 301.8 million to address our
structural overtime shortfall in the current fiscal year and 21.1 million
toward the department's structural technology funding shortfall mayor Adams has proven his commitment to public
safety again and again and again and the NYPD is thankful for his continued
support in addition to the department's operating budget our 10-year capital strategy includes 1.55 billion for
fiscal years 2025 through 2035 this funding is critical for facility
construction projects over 698 million or 45% of the
capital budget including a renovated firearms training facility communications and other information
technology infrastructure over 428 million or 28% and large vehicle life
cycle replacements including ESU trucks tow trucks boats and
helicopters 385 million or 25% % while we have not yet experienced any direct
impact on our federal funding levels under the new administration we are closely monitoring any directives and
new grant guidance federal funding while only making up 3.7% of our overall
budget covers critical functions within the department on average the NYPD receives just under $200 million each
year in new federal grant funding and the majority of that support historically comes from the US
Department of Homeland Security the DHS grants enhance the department's counterterrorism capabilities especially
in the transit system and at our ports these grant funds have supported counterterrorism efforts by funding the
department's efforts to among other priorities deploy officers within the transit system and train officers to
respond to chemical ordinance biological and rad
the federal fiscal year 2025 standard terms and conditions that will accompany new grant agreements among other
provisions the grant template includes a requirement that grant recipients certify certain forms of cooperation
with federal civil immigration enforcement with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration
Officials in addition to future funding awards being at risk because most
federal grants span multiple fiscal years potential constraints on new funds could also affect dollars already
awarded at present the department has approximately 246 million in authorized but unbuild spending across all open
grants federal fiscal year 2020 through the most recent federal fiscal year 2024
which could be at risk of this 212.1 million is DHS 18.4 4 million is DOJ and
15.5 million is from other federal sources on May 13th 2025 New York State
Attorney General Leticia James joined 19 other state attorney general in a lawsuit challenging the new DHS
conditions the complaint argues that tying emergency management and disaster relief funding to state immigration
enforcement actions unlawfully exceeds the department's statutory authority
federal grant funds are essential and critical to safeguarding New York City residents and visitors as well as our
critical transportation and port infrastructure the NYPD will be closely following any news and updates regarding
this lawsuit and we will continue to work with OM to assess any potential impacts to this critical funding stream
in my 17 years working in city government I have never accepted the status quo when the status quo no longer
serves New Yorkers
has reduced crime launched a series of new strategies and plans to improve safety and quality of life and
instituted a number of reforms to improve our efficiency effectiveness and performance we are proud of this
progress but we also know that there is more work to do i am driven by that work
and committed to a strong partnership with the council we may not always agree but there will always be clear
communication and mutual respect and a shared focus on the safety and the well-being of all the people we serve
thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the extraordinary work of the men and women of the New York City
Police Department my staff and I look forward to answering your questions
thank you very much Commissioner for your testimony uh we've been joined by council members Marte Areola Powers
Brewer Wrestler Brooks Powers and Sanchez uh and Stevens i want to jump right into
um the unspent salary funding so over the course of the fiscal year uh NYPD
hasn't been staffed to its budgeted amount uh we see that there are approximately 1,300 uniform vacancies
and 1,600 civilian vacancies and we understand the department is trying to hire up to its budgeted amount and the
council is supportive of the department doing so uh we believe hiring to your full headcount could also offset some of
our overtime costs which is always a topic of interest at the council so at this time how much was budgeted for
salaries that hasn't been spent due to vacancies
so actually at this time we don't have significant personnel acrruals because the funding that had been taken tied to
uh restricting our headcount uh was restored and tied to restoring the classes that we had this year so we're
actually not anticipating significant acrruals in the current year the budget was adjusted frankly without the
headcount being taken down so it had been adjusted previously so it's pretty in line with what our staffing level so
there won't there isn't a there isn't unspent funding in the budget due to vacancies no
are you planning to selfund any new needs with with any extra money you might have we do that on the margins if
there's small amounts of money for example for OTPS or PS we will not it around but nothing significant
anticipated at this time and when do you project that you'll be able to fill all the vacant positions om has indicated
that we should be able to to get to headc count based on the funding perspective from fiscal year 27 we are
trying to do as much as we can as the commissioner said in the current calendar year we're looking to hire 3,500 officers we had a class of over
a,000 in January 769 in April are you planning more academy classes that are
over a thousand yes um we are the mayor has
been as we can find right now the goal is 35,000 by fall of next year we had
our first class in January of a thousand that was the largest class we've had in about 10 years uh our next class in
April was about 800 we're going for another thousand in July and and another
thousand thereafter at the preliminary budget hearing uh earlier this year NYPD testified that
the projected overtime spending for FY25 is going to be approximately 1.23
billion in this plan uh 301 million was added to FY25 bringing the current OT budget to
around a billion dollars so can you update us on the the endofear projection for overtime spending yes so actually
based on the overtime management plan that we've put in place and the savings we are seeing year-over-year we're now
projecting 1.1 billion for this year and and a portion of that will be grant funding
and how have some of the initiatives that you've implemented affected overtime spending and how does it how
does overtime spending currently compared to last year so the last year so essentially the
first half of fiscal year 25 as mentioned before was almost 11% higher
than in in in 2025 was 7 11% higher than in 2024 what we've seen this year since
the implementation of the overtime management plan is consistent month overmonth reductions january
year-over-year was down 9.7% february was down 10% march was
down 13.7% year-over-year and April was down 15%
so the FY26 OT budget is 578 million is
PD in talks with OM to rightsize the FY26 budget to to more accurately
reflect the actual spending yes we've been having those conversations they've been ongoing we're working with OM on
our fiscal year 26 projection and we do anticipate there will be adjustments both to reflect the need that we have on
the city funded side and also grants as they're awarded throughout the year okay the state budget included $77
million uh to New York City for overtime and enhanced patrol in the subways and
mass transit systems uh what is the plan has it been published for the public yes
so um at the NYPD uh working with the governor's office that plan funds mostly
putting two officers on every overnight train that has been running for several
months now and we are seeing very good results in terms of our uh subway safety
numbers as we sit here right now I believe uh transit crime is down 6% year
to date and could you give us an idea of how many offices are dedicated just to daily
subway patrols well for the subway safety plan for the
the overnight subway safety stuff it's upwards of 300 officers that we have
doing um the shifts on the trains and is it usually the same cops or do you rotate
it is largely the same officers doing it okay
and how does um how does overtime spending come into play here with the
enhanced uh patrol of the subways some of that is done on overtime and which
actually makes the reductions that we've seen since January since the overtime management plan all the more incredible
um because that is an area where we've had to use extra overtime and nonetheless month after month we are
seeing doubledigit declines uh departmentwide in overtime spend
um okay we heard that approximately half of NYPD's bomb squad is eligible for
retirement is that true i don't have those numbers in front of me okay it is
it is certainly quite possible um as I've said a number of times 20 years ago the city hired huge
classes of police officers and so there is an unprecedented number of people
this year eligible for retirement among the reasons that we are so focused on um
our hiring and getting as many people as possible into and through our academy
but I can look at and get back to you on the exact numbers of people in the bomb squad eligible for retirement but if
you're getting at are we going to train more people to join the bomb squad we
generally look at where people are eligible for retirement and try to plan
accordingly in terms of staffing different units in the department
okay as of March uh around $30 million has been spent on terminal leave it's
approximately 154% more than what was budgeted in FY25 could you tell us what
the reason is for that increased spending so we have seen uh as the commissioner
said there were large classes 20 years ago there were large classes in January i think there were some last year as
well so when you have more people retire there's more terminal leave payouts are more senior officers with more time
saved and and a higher salary leaving i don't have the specific distribution
but we can get back to you on that okay
um within the traffic enforcement uh unit of appropriation there's $7.7
million budgeted which supports uh $ 160 full-time positions for tow violations
as of March we see that about $130,000 has been spent for three
positions could you walk us through that tell Is this actual underspending in this area or have people been reassigned
i'll have to get back to you on the details on that specific object code and budget code okay because it looks like
there's like 157 vacant positions according to the U of A we'll look at
that there may just be a misalignment there okay uh okay one more from me and then I
have a lot of questions from colleagues the um executive capital plan includes uh 80 million about $80 million in FY25
and about 12 million in FY26 for the radio upgrades and encryption uh this represents an increase of almost $10
million in FY26 could you tell us what the status is of the radio encryption have all preins and burrows been
encrypted uh no they have not all been
encrypted yet um out of our 36 zones
63.9% 23 or 63.9% are already encrypted and we
believe that the full migration is projected to complete within one year
one last question just something um local for me the capital plan includes $9.5 million for the reconstruction of a
firing range in my district in Coney Island uh could you tell us when construction will begin and end so we
actually anticipate construction beginning this summer uh with that the contract is almost finalized and in
place uh I will before the end of the hearing get you the exact date of when we anticipate it will be complete okay
we've also been joined by Deputy Speaker Ayala i'm now going to turn it over to Chair Salam thank you very much
thank you i want to start with the 911 operators
hiring at the preliminary budget at that hearing we heard that
there was a shortage of 911 operators and that 911 calls were being directed to an audio recording we heard testimony
that a significant amount of 911 operators were on leave due to mental and physical stress this is why the
council called on the administration to provide adequate staff to answer all 911
calls in a timely manner what is the current budget and actual headcount of
911 operators the um budgeted FY26 budgeted headcount
for PCTS is 1,412 currently we sit at
1,210 which means we have 22 vacancies i am pleased to report that
we have a plan to get to our budgeted headcount within a year and this is
absolutely essential the members of our communications division our 911 um call
takers are a lifeline for New Yorkers and every call needs to be answered
without delay but that's not all the changes that we've made to our 911 call
center operations recently we changed management there we have been working
directly with the union with DC37 on ways to improve
um the quality of um the experience of
being at PCT for example we're looking at providing shuttles for our 911 call takers to the sha to the trains when
they're done with a busy shift and we have also changed who the 911 call
takers and the communications division is reporting to our first deputy
commissioner and her office are now overseeing very closely all of these
changes at 911 and it has quite serious focus from this department on addressing
the issues that you raised at the last hearing
you said that the number that you were hoping to reach or going to reach was
how much the budgeted headcount is 1,412
and you're currently at 1,210 yes 202 vacancies
202 got it would this be an appropriate number to
answer the nearly 8 million 911 calls that come in each year so I am never shy
about asking our office of management and budget in New York City or the council for new needs but I can't I
don't believe that I'm in a place now to come to you or to come to OM asking for
new needs in terms of greater authorized headcount until I get to or closer to
the authorized headcount but when we do a year from now hopefully that will be a
very different conversation well we will be having that conversation
when I the the the budgeted number for police communications is down in real numbers
from when I oversaw the communications division back when I was deputy commissioner of it and I think we have
to get back towards the 2017 numbers which was a few hundred PCTs higher than
what the current budget is
do you know how many operators are currently on leave i do not have that information in front of me but we can
get back to you right after this hearing and are 911 calls being directed to an
audio message when there are delays meaning when all
of the 911 call takers are busy answering other calls you will hear an
audio recording that basically says um just hold the phone um so yes there
are some calls that do not that where the call the caller will hear that audio
message generally at very busy times we are quite focused on reducing the
percentages of calls that go to that audio recording we need to get that back
down to zero among the reasons why we are so focused on this um hiring uh I am
proud to report that in the past month as we have been doing this real focus on
um addressing issues at the 911 call center the percentage of calls going to
that recording is is reduced do we know what the average time someone
who is in need of help is sitting on hold when it goes to the audio message i I don't have that time in front of me
but I believe that that time is going to be the average time is going to be incredibly low because the vast majority
of calls to 911 are answered
immediately and on recruitment we heard in your opening statement about some of the initiatives that you have taken to
increase NYPD's recruitment can you talk more about those initiatives and any new
ones since our hearing in March yes a few things the first thing that we did
is we looked at the elig the eligibility requirements what requirements we put on
candidates looking to become police officers and a place where we had a real glaring opportunity to improve was on
the college credits so historically at the department we have required 60
college credits to enter into the academy after a lot of thought we
reduced that number down to 24 college credits at the same time our our academy
has been accredited for more credits than previously so um people completing
the academy they they won't end if they have less than 60 college credits they won't end up with the same amount of
credits they otherwise would have had but they will end up with a significant amount of credits at the end of um their
time at the academy in addition to that we have also been working with our
fraternal organizations our NYPD associations we have many many many of
them and they know their communities the best they have been working in partnership with our personnel bureau on
um a massive recruitment effort meeting people where they are in their
communities in their schools in their houses of worship and that has been
quite successful in terms of driving up the number of uh filers or or applicants
we have to the department over the past several
months i've heard from captains in my district as I'm sure many of our colleagues have that they need
additional officers for their precincts can you talk about the staffing levels of the precincts and how officers are
assigned and deployed throughout the city yes I am very um I agree with them
we need more cops in our precincts i am also proud to tell you that as we sit
right now we have more cops on patrol today than we did a year ago and that is
because we have reassigned over a thousand officers previously working
desk jobs into precincts um and as we've
discussed at this hearing we are also looking to hire more and more as many
officers as possible because we need cops in our patrol commands you know my
approach to staffing at the NYPD is patrol transit housing
operational commands first everything else is a luxury but unless and until
those commands and those positions are fully staffed we can't see bloat in
other parts of the department and so the way we've gotten more cops onto patrol
is one by upping our hiring but two rep prioritizing those numbered commands as
we call them i want to ask about
overtime recently there was a scandal involving NYPD's former chief of department we would like to hear about
the NYPD's process for approving overtime going forward oh so in January of this year we
instituted an overtime management plan in the department where we set very
clear thresholds for uniform and civilian members of service on the
civilian side based on title and on the uniform side based on type of assignment
is it operational is it investigative or is it administrative we also have our first deputy
commissioner and our deputy commissioner of management and budget pouring over all of the overtime records to ensure
that each officer is not exceeding those overtime thresholds we
have created a new position in each command which is someone assigned an executive among their duties assigned to
ensuring compliance with the overtime rules uh and when our first deputy
commissioner or deputy commissioner of management and budget see anomalies that's who they will reach out to but
their work these their work has been extraordinary it takes an incredible
amount of doggedness and effort not just to set the standards but to make sure
that the entire department is conforming to them and I believe that we now have
the processes and procedures that are required to effectively and responsibly
manage overtime at the New York City Police Department
and I'm sorry I I found the answer to one of your previous questions the average 911 call is answered in less
than six
seconds well definitely thank you for that answer
why is 98% of the NYPD's uniform overtime budget still held in the chief of department's unit of
appropriation wouldn't budgeting overtime in other areas be an additional check on overtime spending and approvals
so the reason for that is because officers are often working overtime outside of their home command if it's a
parade if it's a protest if it's certain event so we we budget it centrally
because we honestly don't know in the beginning exactly which officer is going to be doing which overtime so the
distribution would just not be realistic across each of the uh individual uh
structures for the commands would NYPD work with OM to
budget overtime costs at the precincts and unit level at the unit level instead of holding most of the overtime funding
in one budget code so because of the challenges I just indicated that would
not enable us to manage the overtime if not it would not be reflective of how the overtime actually gets utilized
i want to move to questions about subway surfing
in recent times some of the youth in our city have been partaking in a dangerous trend of
subway surfing i would like to hear more from the commissioner on the department's
resources dedicated to educating and stopping our youth from partaking in
this dangerous activity i would also like to make sure that we aren't arresting them for this but rather we
are trying to make them understand that this is an activity that they cannot and
should not do because of the inherent dangers they're in if if it's okay chair
I'll have our chief of uh transit who oversees these efforts answer that question yes so subway surfing is one of
the main things we look at the average age of a subway surf is 14 years old which is very concerning for all of us
we had a a meeting in this room where we discussed that previously um and we take
it very seriously we take a a a couple different approaches to this one would be we have drones up um looking for
subway surfers and when we do get a subway surfer and it do stop them it's
not just an arrest it's not about arresting what we'll do with this is we will meet with the parents we will sit
down we will talk to the kids we'll identify the school we'll get our outreach to that school and speak to the
students at that school because a lot of times what we see it's repeat offenders at repeat schools so it's about outreach
at the center of everything we do with subway surfing using technology to help us do that as well and there's some
harrowing uh videos out there where you see very young individuals up on top of those trains and it's very concerning to
us but our core purpose is to identify them to identify the repeat offenders get with
their parents get with the schools and try to prevent it in the future and oftent times the parents the chief has
reported to me the parents are shocked when they see the videos of their kids
subway surfing but the parents definitely have to be a part of this equation here yeah and and to the
commissioner's point um we've had parents collapse can that were there to tell their a tragedy had happened to
their to their child who was serving so we see the effect it's it's deep rooted and uh like I said a lot of times we see
repeat offenders well definitely thank you for the effort
to stem this uh dangerous I don't even know what to call
it but it shouldn't happen right um I'm going to come back to my questioning but I'm going to
um yield to allow for Tiffany Council Member Tiffany Kaban to ask her
questions thank you uh good morning all uh I want to start with the policy that you referenced um in your testimony
about issuing criminal summones to cyclists for minor traffic infractions uh so I I just I am what I would like to
get on the record is exactly what the policy um states in more detail than
what we're seeing here uh and specifically does the policy to issue criminal summons apply to all traffic
infractions or specific ones like if there is a a I'm going to go through a couple of questions because my time is very limited um or are there specific
ones um and then in relation to that is there a similar policy for non-cyclists
so pedestrians uh motorists etc uh a and then the the second part of this question has to do um with how the
officer approaches that policy does the policy mandate that the officer is to issue a criminal summon or is the decision discretionary and if it is
discretionary I want to know what the factors are um that officers are taking into account whether to issue a criminal
summon or a or a civil summon okay so no it does not apply to all traffic
infractions there are six specific violations they are reckless driving
operating an ebike while under the influence of alcohol or drugs wrongway
riding disobeying red light signals disobeying traffic control devices and
failure to stop at a stop sign what was your second question that the policy
that that where you can issue that criminal summon is it a mandate or is the decision discretionary by the officer
officers in in any situation involving enforcement i mean officers are going to have discretion okay um so wait hold on
but to answer your question right we are giving them direction in terms of how we are looking to approach certain types of
information what are the factors cuz I'm running out of time so I just want to know list out the factors no no but that's not as as you all know that is
not how discretion works it it absolutely is it is not it is not some rigid list that's not what discretion is
at all that's factors are not Okay hold on for a second factors are not a rigid list right when a policy is
discretionary there is usually um a some sort of information around hey officers
these are the things that you should look out for um or consider when you are making the decision whether to do a
thing i'm I'm not asking for black and white hard and fast rules i'm asking you to list out what some of the factors that officers are encouraged to take
into account when they're deciding to use their discretion and and my point to you is that discretion is not the
exercise of discretion by our officers which is critical of course is not particular to C summones for certain
types of ebike infractions right when we're talking about traffic infractions generally when we're talking about
violations officers exercise discretion and and what are they thinking about when they exercise that discretion what
are the factors that they are thinking about when deciding how to to use their
discretion and it's it does not reduce to some list it is a holistic it is a holistic assessment thank you I only
have a couple seconds left so I want to finish asking questions but I think it's important to note on the record for everybody here that there's no like it
is not um it does not increase public trust in how this is being enforced if
you cannot even articulate or name the things that officers are considering when using that discretion or not and if
I could just have a couple extra seconds to to wrap up my thoughts go ahead uh on on this chair's um so I I think that
fundamentally that's an enforcement problem that is that is unacceptable i will say that the consequences of these
stops versus I I understand that there is a real challenge in creating um safe
habits but the the enforcement mechanisms and their impacts are really really disperate where a person might
get their their license suspended a person who is more likely to be a person of color who works a low-wage job who
might be an immigrant that gets a criminal summon may end up in deportation proceedings may have to go to criminal court for for months
sometimes up to a year or more um and so it's it's it's not just it's not right and
it's actually quite dangerous and the data shows that ebike collisions and injuries um through April 30th 2025 are
down 26% prior compared to the year before um rider injuries are down 17% in
that same period and pedestrian industry injuries are down 47% so I think that there are other ways to accomplish these
goals that don't involve criminalization of already vulnerable communities and outsized criminalization at that and
then I just want to uh I will end with a comment it's not a question but I I appreciated um Commissioner the the
testimony around acknowledging the long-standing racial disparities because they do exist and we can't deny them and unfortunately you had colleagues here at
the last hearing who just denied them so I I'm glad that we can at least agree on those facts it doesn't do you guys any
favors to deny that um but I will say that I was surprised by it kind of being viewed a a little bit under rosecolored
glasses here because the they haven't been substantially reduced or eliminated i I will say it's not just the stops
where the racial disparities remain but I laid out these numbers exactly in the last hearing but it's after the stop
motor vehicle stops in particular where we're seeing large racial disparities for searches after stops for arrests
after stops and for use of force after stops um with black and brown people versus white folks and so I I just think
that like we can acknowledge them but also we should acknowledge them to the scale that they exist so that we're actually doing something about it thank
you now we have uh questions from majority whip Brooks Powers
thank you chairs and hi commissioners good to see you thank you for your testimony um I'm going to start in
district issues and then span out in terms of citywide so the council and
community fought hard to secure the the creation of the 116th precinct to improve public safety and reduce
response times in Southeast Queens can the NYPD provide an update on the
staffing timeline and resource allocation for the 116th precinct will
the executive budget ensure full operation capacity for a fiscal or by
fiscal 26 also wanted to know what investments are being made in violence prevention
and intervention programs particularly for youth um how is the NYPD partnering with the cure violence groups and
community organizations to address gun violence in a holistic and preventative way rather than relying solely on
enforcement and then the last question is around um the cycling enforcement i
know that council member Kaban spoke on it but I just wanted to underscore the concern about
um cyclists being given criminal violations for infractions um
which is not what motorists get i do recognize that there is a need um a
substantiated need to have greater enforcement because there is a degree of
what the public feels has felt like lawlessness in terms of cycling behavior
but I don't know that giving criminal citations is the
way to go and so I wanted to understand better the police department's rationale for issuing criminal summones to
cyclists for minor infractions like running a red light when the same infraction is treated as a civil penalty
um for pedestrians and drivers so let me start uh with the new 116 precinct um
current personnel assigned there 199 people uh two captains uh seven
lieutenants 20 sergeants 147 police officers and
detectives and 23 civilians we have seen
great results I would say in terms of the decrease in response times since
that command opened up so um if we look at precinct average response times for
all calls pre and post for the 105 precinct pre the 116 opening the average
time was 21 minutes and 3 seconds post the average response time is 8 minutes
and 38 seconds if we look at the 113 same idea pre 20 minutes and 48 seconds
post 16 minutes and 19 seconds so we are pleased with the the what we are seeing
in terms of the trends in response times um I'll do ebikes quickly and then I'll
call someone up to um talk about cure violence and the work we do partnering
there uh I said in my testimony that I am eager to work with this council on a
legal framework new enforcement paradigm for ebikes in New York City in fact I
call on this council to change the laws as they relate to ebikes in this city um
but under the current law we had two options one was issuing B
summones and the other was issuing C summones as it relates relates to ebike
enforcement the B summones were virtually meaningless
b summones work for cars for vehicles where licenses are required because if
you have multiple infractions or you don't show up you know to court or you
don't pay your summons there are real consequences you either get points on your license or your license is
suspended so the B summons paradigm exists for licensed
drivers because ebikes aren't licensed b summones don't work they're meaningless
so the only option that we had under the current law as it exists was to issue C
summones i look forward to working with this
council to address this issue headon i do believe that the enforcement
framework has to change we can look at licensing we can look at other things but the current state of affairs doesn't
work for anyone it doesn't work for the cyclists and it certainly doesn't work
for pedestrians i want to be extremely clear this is not a war on ebikes or
bikers this is in response to very real concerns that are widely held across
virtually every burrow and every neighborhood in this city where we're hearing people tell us that they are
afraid to cross the street where we see a terrible video in Williamsburg from
this weekend of a young child being blasted by an ebike barreling down the
street the old paradigm of issuing B summones and having virtually no enforcement didn't work i believe that
the C summons is the best option that we have now and we are seeing people on
ebikes pay more attention to the rules of the road as we have begun this
enforcement push i also want to put in context that of something like we've
given out 250,000 plus B summones or tickets to
drivers this year so far this year the number to bikers is several thousand so
it is definitely I mean we we need to keep the scale of the different types of
enforcement in mind as we talk about this and I appreciate the perspective and um as you may know we have a bill um
right now in my committee that looks to create a task force to address um the
the the need for greater regulation and to to take into account this relatively
new mode of um transportation and I welcome any feedback and suggestions
that um the department may have to contribute to that but thank you for that and chairs if I could just ask one
final question if that's um so our our districts particularly in southeast Queens and I'm sure this is happening
citywide quite honestly are being inundated with commercial vehicles parking um being parked illegally
overnight with many repeat offenders um law enforcement has the ability to issue
the maximum penalty when issuing tickets to stop the behavior can we understand
how come that's not happening do we have transportation here
or do you do you want to take that chief i was going to take cure oh let him do cure violence sorry we skipped that and
then we'll answer your transportation question thank you for Go ahead yes u Chief Michael Petri the chief of crime control strategies so approximately a
year ago the ceasefire program the NYPD ceasefire program was moved into crime
control strategies and as you know ceasefire and cure work hand in hand so
my office working with the mayor's office of criminal justice share data with cure you know we we give them data
as far as uh shots fired uh incidents shooting incidents we also provide them
with intelligence so we when we get intelligence of a possible retaliatory
shooting involving uh crews in New York City we reach out to to Cure and we give them this information so it is a very
good relationship i've I've worked personally and my office has worked personally with CUR from the inception
and we will continue to do that thank you you're welcome
good morning CM good morning could you just repeat the question about Sure
thank you for that um so I was focusing on the inundation of commercial vehicles
parking illegally overnight and oftent times there's a lot of repeat offenders
and so law enforcement has the ability to issue the maximum penalty when issuing tickets but we haven't seen that
happening so we wanted to understand why that doesn't happen okay so one of the
things we started to do is uh work very closely in some of the districts of some of the council members here so we'll
reach out and we'll certainly visit um you and your staff just to see what the problem is and we'll be able to tow i
think that's actually better than even issuing summones so we'll do that work for you that would be great excellent i would just add that year to date as of
April 30th truck and trailer overnight parking summones increased by over 42%
this is an area that we are definitely focused on it also overlaps with the work that we're doing with our new
quality of life division so maybe we can all sit down and discuss how we can
directly address the issues that you are seeing in your district i know you're always very clear about what they are
thank you okay we've also been joined by council members Joseph and Hudson and now I'm going to give it back to Chair
Salam thank you i just want to maybe add to the last
part of the the challenge with
ebikes cuz I I'm not [Music]
um I mean the reality is that is there's a there's a problem that needs to be fixed i myself was hit by a bike you
know walking across the 72nd Street uh area and pushed my children out of the
way so that they weren't injured um wasn't a um a delivery ebike
it was just a person on a city bike that might have just been enjoying the day but completely
oblivious that the light now was red and they kept going um so I'm worried about the policy
specifically the policy of criminalizing people for something that really should be a civil matter um especially as it
relates to delivery workers because that that education piece has to be
translated into their understanding of why we need more safety you
know I want to go into the quality of life their teams and the criminal
summones for the ebikes a little bit more and want to discuss the um quality
quality of life division and teams that you recently announced i know they are only being
placed in certain precincts how will you evaluate the effectiveness of these teams for expansion so we are doing a
pilot now in six precincts and we tried to pick precincts where we saw different
crime levels different types of uh quality of life issues um with the
intent of learning from that pilot in those six precincts and then
expeditiously rolling the program out citywide so the intent of this program
is to go citywide and uh a few months into the pilot now as I sit here I
believe that we will be able uh to take this citywide expeditiously and I look
forward to uh announcing soon a schedule for that
and what's the biggest quality of life issue you will be targeting with these teams i mean we've seen the new policy
that criminal sentences will now be issued for traffic offenses and and so forth and so on ebikes um is there an
issue these teams will be specifically focusing on so it will change uh it will
vary precinct to precinct depending on what what the big quality of life
concerns are but I will tell you just citywide illegal parking is certainly the largest
311 complaint we get now over half a million uh 311 complaints about illegal
parking the second highest is residential noise at over 300,000 blocked
driveways 170,000 noise on the street or sidewalk 161,000 abandoned vehicles 70,000 those
types of things that like some are some categories are up or down depending on on what precinct you're at but the very
basic things that people complain to 311 about since 2016 the number of calls to
311 that the NYPD is responsible um to respond to have doubled or have nearly
doubled and so people are clearly like literally calling out for help and the
quality of life teams are designed to address that or be responsive to that
gotcha want to move to stun guns so I want to talk about the NYPD's
use of non-lethal equipment what non-lethal equipment does an officer
have at their disposal when engaging with an individual currently
um for that I am going to ask our chief of training to come up to respond to the
question
more me oh
do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth before the council members of this committee i do you may begin hi sir from our team at Arasa
chief of training so we both equipped with the OC spray otherwise known as MACE as well as the Taser we don't call
it the stun gun there's two models right now we have the Taser 7 that we're
transitioning to coming off from the
X26 x26 do we know what the the life cycles
for this equipment is and is there funding to replace the equipment i know that you said that they're moving from
the X26 to the Taser 7 yes so uh the life cycle is five years for the tasers
and we actually lease the tasers and we pay about $11 million a year for that
and so that means when it comes past five years you get it just a new one at
the same price exactly we're able to replace it is there is the in terms of the life cycle and this is just me maybe
pardon my ignorance if say for instance a taser
is was manufactured say this year and I know we're moving to the X20 to the to
the from the X26 to the taser 7 if in that fiveyear cycle that
particular taser was not used would that taser be like kind of trashed
for lack of a better word i don't I could get back to you on that but I don't believe that we have them uh in a way that we're not using them that they
would expand you know expunge on their life cycle but I I'll just I'll just um
try to make this clear when you lease equipment rather than buy it at city
agencies often that is done to flatten the cost and also to ensure that you
don't run into problems with equipment being past end of life so presumably as
part of that contract once a taser goes beyond year five then the company is
required to provide a new taser to the department so you don't have end of life
equipment is that correct yes okay
what can what can diminish the effectiveness of non-lethal equipment
one could increase the effectiveness of diminish diminish the effectiveness of non-lethal equipment so one thing that
we're taking a good hard look on at in this department right now under the leadership of the first deputy
commissioner and the the chief of training is um the effectiveness of our
tasers i have seen too many videos um body camera clips that end in use of
lethal force um where the officers for first attempted non-lethal force and so
we are pouring through our data looking how we track it and preparing to have um
some conversations with Axon the the company that provides the taser to us to
look at perhaps we should go to beyond the X7 to the newest model if we're
seeing if we're having concerns about um having to use lethal force when we first
tried non-lethal
i want to end with regards to the Argus cameras the executive capital plan
includes approximately $3 million in fiscal year 25 for Argus cameras what is
the cost per box and just as a followup where are you prioritizing placement of the Argus
cameras and the use of this and Argus cameras and the use of this
funding and what precincts are you looking at so the cost per box is about $45,000 per box and each box has two
cameras so you're getting two cameras for $45,000 essentially in terms of uh where
the cameras go our crime prevention division recommends appropriate locations based on data and information
they have and uh crime statistical data and then our strategic technology division works with the DOT to conduct
surveys of those locations to ensure the exact appropriate location for the boxes and the cameras and one thing I am very
pleased about is I understand that some of this work putting up Argus boxes had been delayed for quite some time among
the reasons was an expired contract or lack of an active contract i'm very
pleased to report that we now have uh an active long-term contract to continue to
or to resume our efforts to put up Argus cameras in New York City and I am
looking forward to getting many more boxes up on the streets this year than
we did last year i have the list of precincts where they are going up that I
could either provide you or I could read to you now it's going the the 45 the 62
Central Park 6147 50 Manhattan North 103
10768 122nd 7276 106 404142 109
111149 and those precincts are generally done by which council member gave us
funding to put up boxes where in those districts they go we usually have our
crime team um look at where we're seeing the most violence in those commands
thank you thank you thank you chair okay now we have questions from Council
Member Williams hello i have so many questions so I'll
And they're like all over the place like I had prepared questions and now I have more questions so I'll try to get through them um apologies in advance
chair um so I guess I'll start with traffic enforcement um it is projected to have 10.5 million
in OTPS um I have a lot of questions about
uh costs of trucks and other um equipment that allow the officers in the
precincts to properly um tow trucks so can you share like how much of that goes
to like the lots the trucks and how much a truck costs so the the trucks are actually in our
capital budget so that wouldn't be part of the OTPS that you're seeing there so what is that money for then that money
is for equipment um it anything is it for the window things that you guys are
using now the like the boots yes yes that would be that would be the
barnacles right yes that would be uh covered with OTPS and how do you determine like how to disperse those
assets so when when it comes to anything tied to to the budget and particularly
non-personnel costs the division or the um deputy commissioner of management budget my team and I work with the
individual bureaus uh and commands on what their operational needs are what equipment do they need what what
additional staffing enhancements overtime and we have that ongoing dialogue if there's a new initiative for example for the barnacle hey we want a
better way to do this or a different way to do it we would sit down with the commands look at it my contracts team
would look and say okay what is the estimated cost for this sort of thing and then we would go through if we determined to move forward a contracting
process and are you able to just send my office um scopes for the barnacles the
boots and tow trucks because we had tried to get quotes from the police department about how much it costs yeah
we can give you information on what those pieces and I want to just give a quick shout out to I believe he's a
sergeant Sergeant De Jesus at the 113 he works very hard in that division um and
oftentimes with very limited resources so my thing is always trying to get them more resources so they can do more um
thank you for that you're welcome okay so the other question I have is about the crime lab um the crime lab is in my
district and I know you just visited commissioner i did um and they have a
lot of opinions because we're also doing a neighborhood plan there so they're part of my advisory committee uh roof
leaks heating ventilation issues i actually have a friend who was out of work um because she got exposure to
heroin and she used all the proper materials but the ventilation um within
the crime lab is just not good at all um they don't have enough space to work um
I have heard reports of evidence being lost and so the police officers are going out and doing all this good police
work and then if you're not able to like properly assess what they're bringing in
to them these for these cases to be prosecuted it kind of defeats the purpose so just wondering if there are
any plans to get a new crime lab renovate the existing crime lab yeah I
was um actually as you mentioned I was there last week to discuss with them or
to start the discussion with them on just that topic i think it's very clear
to me and to others in the department that the current crime lab is not a
crime lab that is built for the future and I believe we need to start the
capital process of assessing or figuring out what the the go forward plan is for
a new crime lab i don't believe that anyone thinks that it would make sense to renovate the
existing building um but we are getting that together now i know that in the detective bureau they've done a huge
amount of work over the past several years to begin some of this analysis and I am looking forward to hopefully moving
this from an idea into a budgeted because I heard reports of like um not
able to have upgraded computer systems that allow them them to do their work efficiently um I also well the computer
the the upgrades to computer systems that should be happening and I will talk to the IT teams if that is not happening
certainly it's required for their accreditation which is coming up but I
am looking forward to working with the mayor's office and the office of management and budget to making and
making it one of my capital priorities to push ahead on a crime lab of the
future for New York City okay and one more thing um still in the crime lab is
uh also that they don't have money in their budget for the contracts they maintain the equipment so apparently
there's a ton of equipment not being used because they don't have money to contract someone to service the
equipment so it's odd because that didn't come up when I spent a few hours uh there last week but it is certainly
something that our deputy commissioner of management and budget will follow up with our chief of detectives on okay can
I just ask a few more questions thank you so much um can I this is just you can give me this later but if I can get
a racial and gender breakdown of the recent discretionary promotions and upcoming ones that would be great
um one of the chiefs uh testified about sharing intel with cure are you talking
about the CMS groups yes themselves um okay dc testified last week they didn't
mention that because we asked about the relationship with CMS and NYPD they did share the only thing they said was about
the roll call and so I just wanted to know if you have any data on the frequency of how many times a CMS group
attends roll call i don't really think that's an effective way to really develop a relationship even though I've attended roll calls I feel like the
relationship needs to be a little bit more than saying hello to the officers that are about to go in the streets i
can't answer the roll call question but I could tell you that my office uh usually has a call with Cure Violence
CMS on a weekly basis and we share data on a weekly basis also okay
um I'll just hurry up with my last questions um I'm excited about the Q teams i would love to know when they
will be rolled out in the 103rd 105th 113th and 116th precinct because quality of life is probably number one in
Southeast Queens and I know the um commanding officers that we have had a
lot of them have grown up in the community and they take great pride in reallocating resources to address
quality of life but we're really excited about the Q teams and so just wanted to know when it when you plan to roll it out in Southeast Queens i will have
those dates uh soon okay in lastish for
right now um is I know you testified that you look forward to working with us on youth strategies and in a previous
hearing um there was some testimony on like the youth officers and I love community affairs I will say that all
the time I don't think their budget is enough and I think between the community affairs officers and the youth officers
like these are the officers that we want to see do this proactive and not reactive police work and I just don't
think that their budgets align with the department's this priority of like trying to help our young people uh do
better i understand the feedback and I will say we we can get you the exact
numbers but I will say that the community affairs bureau is perhaps the
only bureau in the department whose staffing numbers are significantly
higher today than they were in 2018 when we
had 11% more officers um so I am also
sensitive to staffing in community affairs understand the feedback but I
wanted to make sure that it was put in that context and that perspective yeah i'm more so looking for more resources
in their OTPS budget understood yeah like we have them great but then oftent
times they're not able to actually do the things that would be wonderful in the community because they don't have any money to do it understood thank you
okay we have questions from Ayala followed by Holden thank you um I had a question regarding
the 911 uh response time i just needed some clarity so you mentioned that uh
the response times are usually around 6 minutes I believe oh I'm I'm so sorry the question was how what's the average
time in which a 911 caller's call is first answered and it is under six
seconds under six seconds okay is that all of the time because it's kind of contrary to what we've been hearing the
average excuse me that is the average and I um said that because the vast
majority of 911 calls are answered immediately but over the past year and
this was raised at the last hearing we've seen an unacceptable rise in the
number of 911 calls that first get that go to a recording yes under the
leadership of the first deputy commissioner we are taking a real good
hard look and turning over lots of stones at the communications division
and that plan in and with with the purpose of driving down the number of
calls that first go to that recording um we are looking at our staffing levels
making an aggressive plan to hire to budgeted headcount over the next year in
the PCT title we've done management changes there we're looking at changes in procedures and we are also working
very closely on all of this with DC37 who's really rolled up their sleeves
under Henry's leadership and been a very good partnership and helping us begin to
address the issues that this council so able called out yeah no I really appreciate that because I this is kind
of you know new territory for us i hadn't ever heard of a situation where
you know um the wait times had been as long as they were so I really appreciate Me neither and I in um my previous role
at the NYPD I oversaw the 9 the communications division which is the
includes the 911 call takers and so when this issue was first brought to my attention I too was shocked yeah yeah no
it was pretty bad um regarding the uh the change in policy um from C2B bike
um violations for ebike um riders you mentioned that you would welcome a change in the law um and better uh I
guess interactions with the council but I I I'm curious had there been any conversations prior to the change in
policy i'm so sorry I didn't mean better interactions with the council i have always worked very well with the council
um my my point was that the current framework for regulating the use of the
safe use of ebikes doesn't make sense it doesn't work and we've had the
proliferation of ebikes in New York City without an accompanying change in the
regulatory framework for it yeah and so I believe that something has to change
in the law and I am interested in working directly with the council with
the department of transportation to chart the future for
creating the new to chart the future for ebikes in New York City yes i mean I think you know I myself have almost been
run down by an e you know a biker i would say it's a biker because it wasn't an ebike but um you know on a bike lane
ironically enough so I get it i you know I I believe that there needs to be you know some level of accountability i
think you know the concern that you're hearing from the body today um and have been hearing probably you know via
social media and you know every other form of communications that we have is that we have a very different
administration that is um spending a lot of resources uh deporting individuals
that you know are not even on the list of you know dangerous uh individuals and
um we don't want to further complicate matters by um
criminalizing folks that would be more susceptible to that type of behavior if
if you if that's understood however I am open to having a conversation with the NYPD about exploring ways that make
sense to clarify what those consequences should be um I just I'm not aware of any
conversations happening before the change in the policy have there been just I'm just looking for clarity on
that um so I think that you know I'm new to the department but my sense is the
department and frankly New Yorkers have felt for a long time that the current in
that the enforcement use the use of B summones as the enforcement paradigm was
virtually futile that our officers were out there writing tickets and that it
wasn't causing or creating any changes of behavior to the contrary because
people on ebikes generally felt like they lived in a consequencefree environment we were all
seeing widespread mass flouting of the very basic rules that we have in New
York City around transportation safety and so under the current law the only
other option was to write C summones which we are doing now in greater
numbers than we had previously but just again to put this in context it is
several thousand uh um summones for ebikes this year
compared to over 250,000 summones for cars and that
doesn't include the red light cameras and all that other stuff just that the NYPD has has given out but yes I think
we agree i look forward to working with the council to come up with a framework
for uh safe ebike or bicycle use in New York City that meets the current
magnitude of the problem okay and we we welcome that i think we all agree right we want safer streets and we want you
know even bikers right to uh feel free and safe on on the road and so um we
welcome that i just wanted to clarify because I wasn't aware of any conversations that had occurred prior um
to today regarding any legislative fixes to this problem um and finally I have
two more questions regarding the um purchasing of vehicles is there how much
money is is set aside in the budget to purchase new um vehicles for the local precincts i'm sorry if I missed it i was
late so in the current budget we have is it $21 million i'm doing this off the
top of my head yeah so um in in the in the current fiscal year uh we have uh
$21 million and then next year uh what we need uh is close to to 70 million and
OM has graciously indicating they're allowing us to go forward with orders so that we can acquire a,000 new vehicles
in 26 so that's great i mean that is huge for this department a thousand new
vehicles injected into our fleet will allow us to replace a large number of uh
vehicles that are either at or nearing end of life and they will be very
welcome in the commands yes they will i know they bring it up all the time um and regarding the Argus cameras I did I
I know that I specifically um put in some funding for East Harlem and the South Bronx i heard you mention the 40 i
didn't hear you mention the 25 um and it was the funding was earmarked specifically for those two i'm sorry i
have the two five I just do you know how many cameras will be installed in each for each uh I can get you the Hold on
let me see if I have it right here um one second i can get it I can get it back to
you i will get it to you the breakdown by precinct i really appreciate that in your district thank you okay okay
okay we have questions from Council Member Holden followed by Lewis so thank you Commissioner for mentioning
ebikes because um we're at a you know a crossroads in the city um ebikes or
e-mobility vehicles and it's interesting I have co- I have 28 co-sponsors on my
bill to license ebikes which I introduced a while ago 28 that's the
majority of the city council the the people that the the council members that brought up your C summons um issue are
not on the bill and maybe they should get on if they want to really address
this but um and even uh a few have been hit by ebikes they they got on the
original bill and they dropped off um for unknown reasons so if we're in a
public health crisis and your the bums doesn't make any sense um or as you said
then what's the solution and if if if licensing ebikes brings accountability
and a change in behavior it makes a lot of sense but yet we're hearing the
opposite to today but let me just get into um important issues um and I want
to bring up response time because it's been a it's been a big issue and we had
it come uh I hear this almost every week of nightmare stories two weeks ago two
men were riding the wrong way they they were in a vehicle in a car riding the wrong way and hit some
vehicles um residents came out cars were hit they of course these guys were
intoxicated both of them one the driver was definitely intoxicated uh 911 was called one over
one hour the residents held these two individuals over one hour we couldn't
get a a squad car there and um so I want to bring up the the critical response
times what's what's the critical response what's the procedure commissioner on backlog because I don't
hear that anymore i don't hear going into alert where we can get help from a neighboring precinct um I don't hear
central getting on uh and saying and calling the um the people and saying you
know we're we're coming or this will this will uh uh work you know we'll work it out go ahead i'm sorry so which is
exactly why we have made a number of changes over the past month in how the
911 call center is managed including but not limited to having the communications
division report up to the first deputy commissioner's office where her
commanding officer who is sitting in that seat right there used to work for me when the 911 call center was at its
very best running communications and he is now
overseeing the work to address many of the issues that you raised around um 911
and communications but just before I let him speak to give you some numbers that
you requested um crime uh critical crimes in
progress the average response time now citywide is 7 minutes for FY25 7 minutes
and 10 seconds that is down 8 seconds from FY 24
um Chief Npalitano do you have anything to add yes good afternoon Councilman
response time for the NYPD is actually down 9.5% this year for crimes in
progress 9 minutes and 34 seconds last year to 840 this year so we're actually
doing very well on that as far as backlogs backlogs are down 15% this year
15 15% that's correct it's 2,695 last year to 3,00 I'm sorry
3,167 last year to 2,695 this year so we're down
substantially in that as well and do you go into alert um like how do I get how
do I get a a neighboring precinct to chip in and help out when guys are
sitting there for an hour holding these two individuals and this this I can tell you nightmare story after nightmare
story this is going on and we're not solving it i think we need to look at that job and see how and see how it was
coded perhaps there was an error in the coding of it which the chief will address do you have anything else to add
there yes at the break if you'd like to share that with me we'll do a detailed
analysis oh I have a lot not only that story but I have a lot of them and it's it's reoccurring commissioner this is
not going away and we need a some better fail safe because central's deciding
priority isn't aren't they they're who's who decides priority it's actually
decided what the priorities are it's it's calculated and it's it's decided and it's trained to the dispatchers and
just to explain the question you asked earlier if there's a problem in another
command the dispatchers are trained to pull from another command when necessary so if you're in the 104 and uh there's
nobody available but if there's a male shot they will pull from an adjoined yeah but I I asked that question um
Chief and I asked the question Commissioner um I I'll talk to the precinct why didn't you go Why didn't we
get the 112 why didn't we get the 108 to come in why just leave it for over an
hour of two people uh being held by by civilians and I I want to just be very
clear that we agree with you that is not acceptable which is why we want to do a
deep dive to see how it was coded my guess is that it was coded as a vehicle
collision property damage only which is of a lower priority and would get a
longer response time thank you but we will look at it and I think the first deputy commissioner has something to add
sorry also we want to add that uh we added supervisor response time
supervisors to each platoon on communic in communications so over the last month
we're seeing that once we are in alert that those supervisors will make sure that they're talking to the PCTs the
burrows if need be but we'll look into the matter of the job that you brought up thank you all thanks thank you now we
have questions from Council Member Lewis followed by Areola thank you chairs and good morning
commissioner to you and your team um I have four quick questions i'll try to barrel them out and if I get if I'm
granted more time I'll reiterate them uh with the with the increase in school
safety division reflected in FY26 executive budget can NYPD clarify
whether this funding will address long-standing shortages of crossing guards and hightra school zones and
whether new metrics or prioritization tools will be used to guide deployment
and underserved schools school areas and safety uh with with high levels of uh
safety incidents 22 my next one is on uh DV in FY26 there will be an expansion of
team will there be expansion of teams such as Can we do one at a time i promise I'll answer all of them but I'm
going to forget all I'm limited on time but the school safety if you want to start with that okay do you want to give
them give her the numbers school crossing guards yes so um actually I'm just need a second for that for the for
the full-time school crossing guards uh we are we're basically at headcount let me get you the part time if you want to
move on to the to the next question it'll be good to know FY26 what that would look like um for FY26 will there
be an expansion of teams such as victim advocates or domestic violence officers within the individual NYPD precinct
what's the plan uh for how these resources will be equitably allocated
across the city um and with the reduction of the burl squads within the detective division and f in the FY26
plan to what extent will this impact detectives and teams working on outstanding missing person cases and
what are those mitigations looking like so that's regarding that and I could just do the last one really quick um
officers and multiple precincts um have raised concerns about being reassigned
to transit district command often abruptly what is the justification for these reassignments um and are they
primarily due to budgetary constraints or staffing gaps in transit and how are
these reassignments uh impacting local precinct level operations and morale particularly in neighborhoods already
experiencing uh shortages so for many of these issues all touch on
the same thing which is the overall uniform staffing at the NYPD which we
know is down over 10% over the past four years or uh no four or five years um for
the transit uh deployments yes we have pulled cops from other commands to work
in transit um the most recent surge in resources to
transit we aimed to correct some mistakes of the past where we are now pulling
largely from our field training teams meaning officers newly out of the
academy as well as officers previously working administrative assignments in
nonoperational commands and the idea there was to put less strain less pull
on the resources of numbered commands the same priority that we've placed on
numbered commands be they in transit housing patrol in terms of of staffing
we are also doing that with our numbered squads uh for detectives so that has
meant from time to time pulling detectives out of niche or specialty
units and putting them instead into numbered squads it's a numbered command
first approach to uniform staffing at the police department which is exactly
what the police department and the city of New York need now especially given
the uniform staffing numbers that we're seeing will they return back to their commands where they were before i think
that's some of the questions a lot of them have it depends in some circumstances yes and in some
circumstances these are temporary assignments many of the transit deployments that we have done recently
are temporary assignments and the officers should know that um but we will
be very happy to clarify that to them if you are suggesting that it is not known
some of them feel but in terms of the so we will for sure take that feedback and
make sure that that is extremely clear but for the transfers of officers from
um more specialized or niche or centralized
um detective bureau units into squads that those transfers are not temporary
those transfers are permanent transfers because we um need to address the those
um those cases first got it and on the
uh school crossing guards just uh as of last week we had 2,251 school crossing guards that
includes 2,74 level ones those are the part-time school crossing guards and 77 level twos
uh that's uh a vacancy rate of vacancies 45 vacancies on the on the part-time and
12 on the full-time and before the new school year where the personnel bureau uh looks at the school crossing guards
and their schedule hiring in August with the goal of filling those vacations this is August for FY 26 you have a schedule
recruitment this August for this August for the school the upcoming school year yes thank you Commissioner thank you
chairs okay questions from council member Areola followed by Brewer
thank you chairs and thank you commissioner and your entire team for coming out today i want to just touch on
a couple of points that you made that were causing an increase in crime in certain areas and in where you asked for
collaborative help from this council um with respect to
uh criminals who are wearing masks and committing crimes I've introduced Intro 10:15 which would amend the
administrative code of the city of New York to prohibiting ski masks to be worn in public spaces and other sensitive
areas with the exclusion but not limited to uh health and religious uh reasons i
also have a bill that is pending to make ATVs banned from our streets atvs are
off- street vehicles we do not have off-road areas in the five burrows where
they could be utilized we spoke about ebikes many of the members are are
concerns i'm happy to be a part co-sponsor on on um council member
Holden's ebike registration bill our purview with the city council we can
only ask DOT to register the the ebikes but I'm also very supportive of Assembly
Member Rajkumar's bill to have the dis the DMV register license and um ebikes
so this way they can be given a lesser summon when stopped and not and and
would be reduced from a criminal summon additionally we talked about staffing so I have a bill that's that's being worked
on right now it's pending to do a $10,000 sign on and stay on bonus for
our officers we have to incentivize them to come to us and we have to incentivize
us because they've been so disincentivized to come to become police officers and finally the crimes of
urination and public drug abuse have a a bill that's pending being written that
would make them more punishable the fines would be more punishable so that is the way I wanted you to know that
that we are working in collaboration with you especially uh my colleagues and myself and many of those bills I have
bipartisan support but my question is our precincts right now are severely
lacking vehicles in their fleet so I just wondered if there was a plan that you have that you want to set forth that
would enhance the fleet in our local precincts so first council member thank
you so much for your efforts and your partnership on those and so many other
issues of concern to New Yorkers um as for the vehicles it is a piece of
feedback that we are getting from our cops all the time basically citywide that their that their vehicles are
beaten up um and in fact many of them are either at end of life or past end of
life which is why I'm thrilled to report that um the office of management and
budget has greenlighted our purchase of a thousand new vehicles we are placing
or have placed many of the orders already and we expect those vehicles to
trickle in over the next six months and that will definitely be very well
received at commands um across the five bureaus thank you so much that that's
incredible news and I just want to close with thanking you for your collaborative approach changes that you've made in
policies in staffing the compliance stat the fact that your your quality life
division is really making a difference and it has already had a positive effect on crime you know statistics and also
within the NYPD and really you are a steady hand uh in leadership for the
NYPD thank you for what you're doing okay questions from Council Member Brewer followed by Wrestler i've always
liked Kelly and Bratton but you have kicked their ass in terms of your information today and I will tell
them um my question starting with paperwork I think that you are working
on some kind of a um project that would hopefully have a more streamlined
paperwork now don't blame the city council because it's not all our fault but sometimes half of the tour is
filling out paperwork so what are we going to do about that michael Gerber knows all about this
go ahead Michael yeah sure so so um we are working on that and it's a discussion we've had before obviously and I'll just give one good example it's
a small piece but it's in in in the vein of what you're talking about so for example um we now have as you know level
one and level two reporting that we do we had um you know we we realized the cops were doing for level two there's a
consent to search form they had two separate forms right one one the level two form one the consent to search form
um which kicks in at level two so we did what I'm sure you would say is painfully obvious which is we combined the forms
uh and so so now instead of doing having to do two forms in that situation they're doing one so we're looking for
opportunities to do exactly that we want fewer forms uh in a perfect world in a
perfect world there would just be one form that an officer would fill out and it would autopop populate to lots of
other things um I just want to I just I just add here because this is all a lot
of detail like big picture our officers are required to fill out way too much
paperwork and way too many forms and I would welcome the opportunity to work
with this council okay on a massive bill to
modernize what types of forms and what types of reporting the New York City
Police Department and specifically our police officers are required to do because some of this stuff came about
like 10 20 years ago and in my opinion is no longer relevant or necessary
or something that we want our officers like burning their time on it's it's
truly wasteful we agree since they spend half their time when I go out and I see that so let's work on that number two
where's the Manhattan towound so I I've been working on it no I would
I would love to be I've been out looking sitting here saying something other than that unfortunately you the circumstances are
still the same it is very very challenging to find affordable real estate in Manhatt what we are so we are
working in conjunction with Dcast with CBRE which is the the real estate firm that contracts with Dcast what we're
also focusing on they're not the best firm as we remember what what we're focusing on now is really looking at
space that other agencies may have that they are not fully utilizing or maybe have a hold on and something they're not
going to use for a decade any time frame on that so I'm I'm hoping within the
next few months we'll have this solidified if not sooner okay um the issue of the uh ghost plates so you I
want to know how you are updating on resources dedicated to the program and then is there any enforcement that you
can see that's making a difference on ghost plates we do a tremendous amount of enforcement on our ghost cars i'm
just going to pull up the numbers do you know Peter okay
in some neighborhoods it's a lot of ghost plates and there's some lady okay sell selling Virginia plates out of the
back of her car too and you can order them from Amazon
ghost plates year to date
over 34 wait oh
okay year to date over 11,000 B summones over a thousand
seizures okay um All right i mean I assume that makes a difference who knows i mean
there's many more but it's a start right point is we have real resources
dedicated to enforcing the rules around um ghost plates and license plates and
we run operations all the time um another car about cars i don't know what
Crayo cars are but I think they're the rental unmarked cars that were being tracked so you're doing new tracking
procedures i think they're expensive and so I was just wondering to get an update on that well when I uh started at the
department one of the things that we looked at was how we were using and
allocating a class of vehicle called Crayo vehicles which are supposed to be
they're unmarked cars and they're generally supposed to be used for investigative and undercover work and so
we've done um based on that analysis a reallocation of Crayo vehicles to make
sure that they are being assigned to commands where um they are
doing undercover and investigative work and so it's not a million dollars a month or something it's less now oh the
cost for KO yes so it's it's it's not a million we we are projecting uh about 9
to 10 million this year in expenses so it it is a significant expenditure and that's part of why we're looking at
making sure these are used when and how they should be okay but they are a a
meaningful and important part of our overall fleet okay um in terms of um
NICHA I'm a big believer in PSAs but the NICHA residents as you know desperately
need vertical vertical verticals and I just want to know what is there going to be an increased focus on the NICHA
residents they love NYPD they the doors are never going to close i don't care what you do at NICA those doors are
never going to close and so people go in and out you know the issues but there's just not enough PSA folks there so Chief
Makavoy is our new chief of housing and he will answer that question thank you hi good afternoon so um we still do
verticals or as we also call them interiors uh roughly in all the housing developments and roughly we average as
not just from the housing bureau but all the other partners patrol services bureau roughly 70,000 a year okay i mean
I got that i just I have complaints all day long i probably know as much as anybody about NICHA so it it has to be
increased i don't know how to do it the homeless are sleeping there your your friends come they smoke weed in the
hallways they scare the living daylights particularly out of the seniors yeah it is part of the house you got to have more verticals or interiors it's part of
our strategy to uh reduce crime and improve the quality of going to have more verticals or interiors this year
definitely how many more can't wait hold on council member we um I have every confidence that the
chief is going to ensure we have more verticals this year but the real answer to this is addressing the uniform
staffing shortfalls that we have even though I have prioritized in terms of
officer allocation the numbered commands and the numbered squads many of them
most of them are still down real numbers compared to five six years ago and so
hopefully the mayor's plan to get us back up to a staffing of 35,000 officers
that will make the big difference how many verticals were doing no I agree i just want you to focus on NICHA that's
all I'm saying because when I go to Rikers I know all the inmates detaineees
hi Gail hi Gail hi Gail because I know NICHA and so they need help nicha needs
help that's what I'm trying to say um in terms of um CRT how um is the
effectiveness of overtime judge for units like CRT and the new Q teams how
do you you know decide this is effective so um for CRT that is an operational
command and and the way we've we've managed overtime in the department on the uniform side is we have set
thresholds for uniforms based on the type of work they do operational
administrative or investigative crt would be operational which means they
may do 40 hours of overtime each month and the first deputy
commissioner and the deputy commissioner of management and budget um oversee the whole thing and make sure no one exceeds
it in terms of how it whether or how we're assessing whether they are using
their overtime effectively or not do we have someone from the chief of department's office bruce can you come
up thanks oh maybe chief of patrol sorry whatever
sorry could you just repeat that question sure the question is with CRT or quality of life how do you determine the effectiveness based on overtime and
then Chief Rivera I apologize that's okay that's all right thank you both very much you did a great job
Bruce they all do a great job we just got a lot of problems so with respect to
CRT uh you know their mission is primarily uh focused on vehicle uh
introdiction uh mopeds uh our uh car meets that that sort of stuff so um
we're looking at um they stick to their 40 hours if there's special assignments
beyond that then you know we'll allocate them specifically but they're get capped at 64 and the same idea with quality of
life the new division yeah quality of life most of those um cops work actually
in commands and numbered commands and precincts as part of Q teams and so they
would be subject to the same overtime threshold i don't want to I know the issue of ebikes has been discussed a lot
my issue is the folks of the 5100 i assume you can't ask or don't know how
many are undocumented but we can't ask and we I know that i know that so what I'm saying that's what we're nervous
about isis ICE is horrific so that's what the concern is we don't even know if any ICE folks have been to the courts
when somebody from the UIistas has been arrested right we don't
know that is that correct that is correct okay i mean that's what we're concerned about if it w to me if it
wasn't that situation I would not be so nervous but that's a concern is that
something that is everybody's aware of and is nervous about i understand the concern at the police department we need
to enforce the laws whether it be for felonies misdemeanors violations
um to ensure public safety and in this case traffic safety okay and so that's
what we are doing here and I think we have been I have certainly been very
clear in um the fact that the New York City Police Department is going to
follow the sanctuary city laws we are not going to engage in civil immigration enforcement thank you very much i know
that uh thanks to Deputy Mayor Mirror Josie when she was here she did send over some good testimony good
legislation which we would love to work with you on on this topic and that could be uh perhaps some answers to the
deliveristas and ebike problems thank you very much thank you okay questions council member Stevens followed by
Rustler i will I will be quick good afternoon um
good afternoon i know in your testimony um it was it was laid out around like since raise the age and gave some
statistics around like the increase and everyone knows I'm really concerned about um young people and the rise of
violence um been working with folks around really having a decarceration plan because the numbers have tripled
but I also want to make sure that in the same role we look at some of the other things and other factors other than
raise the age because that's not the only factor in New York State right now now the unemployment rate for 16 to 24
years old 24 year olds as of April is 14.2% in January March of 2025 there
were over 620,000 young people in that age group were unemployed 59,000 more
from the previous year this was a 13.2% increase and so I think when we're talking about the raise the age and the
factors we're also not factoring in how we have left young people out of the conversation around jobs and
opportunities and all the things and have not given them a lot of opportunities and so I always want to
make sure that we're having a balanced conversation about young people because if the crime rates around young people
are raising that is a failure on every adult that's sitting in this room and so that has to be said and so for me I know
your job as commissioner and the police department is to enforce the law and to
go after crime um but I I have real concern just even going into the summer and I know we had a conversation i am
scared for what the summer is going to look like um I think that we need to be having a real conversation about where these young people are getting guns from
um and how they're getting access to them so frequently and so freely um but also just thinking about what is the
real coordination in the sense of I 100% agree that we should be
deploying more cops in these areas but I also want to make sure that we're also deploying the same amount of resources
so that young people could have opportunities and I know it was shared that they their stat um that stats are
being shared between CMS groups and I know you stated that you meet with them once a week i would love to just know
what are those conversations look like and when you're talking because I've I've been at a couple of shootings where
um there are hundreds of young people out there grieving and I see cops and I don't see anything else so I would love to hear more about what those
conversations are because if you're talking and you're sharing stats then I would hope that at the same time they're
being deployed and don't you worry I'm holding DYCD and the CMS groups just as accountable because I know love people
people love to say that we're in here yelling at y'all that's not true i'm holding them just as accountable in this situation but I would like to know what
does those conversations look like and how are we coordinating these efforts for the summer so Chief Lepet our chief
of crime control strategies is going to respond
as always the conversations start with prevention so those conversations mostly stem from an
analysis of a shooting incident or shots fired in areas of the city where we know
where the retaliate where the retaliatory violence is going to go when you're having those conversations around
prevention um and I know that um you know the commissioner has been very
clear like if they're shot she's she's going to deploy those officers there are you guys also coordinating with the CMS
groups to also deploy to deploy CMS groups out there at the ta same time to support and what does that look like yes
so how how it works look I'm going to give you a great example you know this
past weekend Memorial Day weekend in the Bronx in the 40 the 44 the 46 the 47 and
the 48 we did not have one shooting incident and one confirmed shots fired and how we do that is put 300 extra
offices on those streets for that weekend and for the whole summer so how just how we surge to specific areas we
like CMS to ser to surge to specific Yeah and that's why I'm asking because I wanted to be clear because we cannot
just deploy cops out there because my fear is that we're going to have kids shooting kids and then cops shooting
kids and then that's going to be a cake for a disaster and so for me there needs to be a much more coordinated effort
between all of these groups to ensure the safety of everyone because I'm not
saying that you know you guys shouldn't be there but what I am saying is other resources need to be deployed and so I
want to see a greater effort from everyone to ensure everyone's safety and
so yes I know that there was a lot of cops out there but that doesn't prevent that's not prevention i I understand we
understand we understand that agreed and so again I just I needed to be on the record that's it you know I got to say
it and I need to say it in every space so again I said the same thing to um NYPD my my last question is also just
even around the quality of life division um excited to hear about this because this has been one of the issues that I
feel like often is overlooked in my district because um I have the 44 the 42 and um 46 we are often fighting crime
and have more serious things and so quality of life is always the last thing so I need to know when those will be rolled out and the 44 4642 because it is
essential for us and will they be getting additional cops for those divisions as well so we are going to we
are working on the rollout schedule now and I expect to have it for everyone
this summer to be able to tell everyone when which command is going to be rolled out when but we are going for a citywide
roll out of it based on the success that we've seen in the first um month or two
two months of the pilot that we have been doing and in some commands it will
be um additional officers but in many of
them it will be a reassignment or a refocusing of existing officers in the
commands i would like to go on record that none of my precincts should have reassignments we need additional officers so I need that to be on record
so the 44 42 46 we need additional officers to pull out this division because we have so much I just want to
be very clear i understood but I want to be very clear that this summer you have
gotten in those commands specifically a lot of cops no I hear you i know i know
you told me not everyone here can say that everyone also cannot say the amount of shootings that they have either so
100% and that's and that is exactly what I respond to them when they complain that we're we have to put the cops where
they are needed um and just the last thing this isn't a question this is a comment i know um I know the police's uh
feelings on the gang database and how you know they feel that it can be improved i just again I'm just always
going to stand on the side of things cannot be fixed when it already comes with a broken system a broken clock
could be right twice a day and it things like that just have to go because it it stem from racism and I know that you
have you feel very differently but I'm that's just not going to change it and I know it's in your testimony i was not
gonna bring it up but because you brought it up I'm bring it up and so we are I know we have conversations coming
up to talk about um how you feel about it I feel about it but I just have to say it because you brought it up and so
I just brought it up so that's it thank you guys so much okay have questions from Council Member Wrestler followed by Joseph thank
you uh chairs greatly appreciate your thoughtful leadership uh good to see you Commissioner
i you know I like you um and I think that I don't say that about
everybody um I don't Bob agrees um I think you're smart i think you're a
strong manager and I think you brought real integrity to the department thank you uh since you've returned to the
NYPD I felt it in my community in my commands uh I felt it in the leadership
we've had Chief Obe and Chief Galato out in the district recently um there is
responsiveness and I think cooperation and partnership and you know we've seen how you've I
think brought meaningful oversight and integrity of the department and it's
it's appreciated and I think we're seeing it in terms of safety across our communities as well is improving and I
think it starts with leadership and I I don't want to that's the most important thing I'm going to say today
um it's not to say I agree with all of your policy choices and there are some that I'm concerned about um you know I
thought that at the end of the Melissa Mark Vivivero speakership the criminal justice reform act was a really positive
development for the city where we gave the NYPD more discretion to shift towards civil enforcement rather than
criminal enforcement on a range of different issues and unfortunately what we've seen in the Adams administration
is a major shift away from civil enforcement toward criminal enforcement in a variety of different areas um you
know I can cite them drinking in public you know from the beginning of the administration to the present 91%
increase in criminal summons drink for drinking in public 1360% increase for biking on sidewalks
1458% increase for bike infractions that are commercial uh non-payment of a fair uh is a 233%
increase so we're seeing these significant increases toward criminal enforcement criminal summons instead of
civil and I just broadly is this a trend that you're concerned about do you think that's the right orientation for the
department the um the policy decision that was made
under my tenure so far at the police department to go towards criminal
summones is specific to bike safety and and more specifically ebike safety and
as I have both testified as I've testified here today my thought is um
that the B summons paradigm did not was not working in New York City for very
obvious reasons that these ebikes in New York City are not licensed and therefore
there is no bite there is no nothing behind the B summons because when you
get a a B summons when you're driving a vehicle the concern is you'll either get points on your license or if you don't
respond you will lose your license or have it have it suspended when you talk
about a mode of transportation that is not licensed the B summons is
meaningless certainly virtually meaningless and so if we were going to kick up enforcement around ebikes in New
York City which many of you on the council have asked us to do it would
literally be burning resources to have more cops out there issuing B summones
the only other option that we have available to us under the law as it
currently exists is ca summones and so for that reason and to address what I
have heard from so many people in so many different parts of the the city to
address these their concerns around safety as it relates to ebikes hitting
people pulling their kids out of the way of a ebike careening down the street we needed to do meaningful enforcement and
so this is that meaningful enforcement i want to tell you that anecdotally I
think it's working i'm seeing ebikes like stopping at red lights not a 100%
of the time but certainly more than they used to do which was like virtually never and I will look forward to working
with this council to create a more tailored meaningful viable approach to
uh ebike enforcement and to to working on what laws will will govern it but as
the law stands now the sea summons is the only meaningful enforcement that we
can do and we have to address the public safety concerns that people are raising
broad strokes before the specifics on ebikes you know I've appreciated that as issues have come up at these hearings
such as NYPD response times to the most serious crimes in progress to call times
uh for 911 for call responsiveness on 911 operators and and calls going to recordings you've come back with saying
recognizing these issues and coming up with operational solutions and giving us time frames for when things will get better which I've appreciated i hope
you'll similarly take a look at a shift away from civil toward criminal enforcement in quality of life issues
that do require your attention and I'm not saying should not face civil enforcement but I I'm concerned about
more people getting swept up in our criminal justice system that don't need it and that's I think why so many of us
are concerned particularly about the criminal enforcement on the ebike issues and these other issues where we have a
Trump administration that is trying to sweep everyone up into their deportation machine that they can are you concerned
that this increased criminal enforcement of ebike riders where we have a high
concentration of undocumented people is going to lead to more people getting really wrongly deported and I will
address this that question first and then your larger point after uh at the New York City Police Department we have
to address public safety concerns we have to we have to um uphold our laws and enforce our laws
and so some of those can be felonies misdemeanors
violations it's it is what we have to do
and as it relates to ebikes the only option that we have at this time that is
viable and meaningful is issuing sea summones i do hope and expect that the council is going to work to create a new
framework to govern ebikes so that the sea summons won't be our only viable
option but right now it is and as we uphold all of these laws like are there
potential downstream consequences certainly but the NYPD does not engage
in civil immigration enforcement period
i I I'm not totally satisfied with the answer but I do agree that it would be
helpful for us to collaborate together on a regulatory framework to have better
and more appropriate enforcement i don't think the status quo is working either
in terms of we have dangerous situations with ebikes that need to be addressed and I don't think the enforcement
approach is the best case scenario and that's the thing the status quo doesn't work for pedestrians agreed it also
doesn't work for people who believe and who are desperate to see more bikes on
the road because what we have seen over the past let's say 10 years is like the
explosion of biking in New York City without any
meaningful legal framework to keep everyone safe and when things grow like
that without a regulatory framework they get out of control and right now my
opinion the an opinion that I know is shared by lots of New Yorkers things are out of control and so we need to work
with this council to bring it back under control and put in place a sensible framework to address it as to your
question about the move to criminalize I will look at those numbers and I will be
prepared soon to have a meaningful conversation with you i believe in the
spirit of those reforms that um you
mentioned but I just want to have more specific numbers in my head before we engage i appreciate you saying that very
much i'll just say this in closing i don't um I don't I don't You know I have
not signed on to Council Member Holden's bill i don't I think that we need a broader conversation about how to hold
the app companies accountable in this that we can't just be focused on enforcement of the bike riders it has to
be a broader approach and if if the police department is interested in engaging the diverse cross-section of
council members on this topic for how we can solve for this I would welcome I would be happy to be a part of those
conversations but my opinion my opinion generally is that we cannot live in a
consequence-free environment bad things come from that and right now the way uh
the B summons worked is ebikes were generally living and working in a
consequence-free environment and my hope is that this council when they pass
whatever reforms are going to be made around ebikes and biking generally in New York City is we will not repeat that
mistake of creating a consequence-free environment i would welcome further conversations with your team on that to
try and craft a regulatory environment that that is enforceable and effective um so I appreciate the time and I I just
want to thank your team is going to meet with us about some of the crime data in the 84 next week and I appreciate that i hope we can get some attention on that
soon thank you okay questions from council member Joseph followed by Hudson
thank you chairs commissioner how are you i have a couple of questions one
what is the rule around fair evasion there was an incident in my district with a gentleman who got on the on the
bus who didn't pay his fair but the way he was treated it took seven officers to subdue someone for $2.90
and if I recall correctly I know the the the council had passed a bill that there
should be education and then enforcement that if you do take someone for fair evasion they should you should notify
them that there's fair affairs i didn't see that happen in that video we can have a offline conversation and show you
what transpired in my community and it's it's unacceptable right for 290 took seven officers to put one gentleman in a
car yeah i I would have to take a look so MTA works us with Eagle teams with NY
team offices as well with bus enforcement so I'd be happy to look at that and see see what happened and and
work closely with you yeah I would love to do that because I don't want that to happen cuz I'm sure that could have happened to one of my older adults who
got on the bus and didn't pay their fairs but you know we want to make sure that it was a lot to watch and and and
it was very aggressive for $2.90 understood i'm happy to work with you on that thank you um um has OM and um the
Office of Labor Relations made progress in the salary for assistant school safety agents yes yes so for the uh
assistant school safety agent title that has been established it's
$37,000 and we are looking to hire our first first group of assistant school safety agents in July and that's the
official title yes if yes the salary is Can you repeat that again uh yeah I'm going to get you the
exact amount it's uh 37,000 but and how many have you hired we we haven't hired
any yet because we are waiting for the certification from the state and then the establishment of the official salary
so the first class will be in July and what type of training drawn out the modified training for assistant school
safety agents what type of training will they receive
where is it hi good afternoon Inspector Tracy Mlette good afternoon Inspector
thank you ma'am they will receive eight weeks of training that will encounter physical fitness as well as NYPD New
York City public schools uh rules and regulations visitor protocol also
they'll learn about restorative justice as well as dealing with child in crisis and deescalation will be part of that
training as well as these are what was the age group for hiring school safety assistants
18 17 depending on how advanced they are I guess if they finish high school but definitely high school no older than 21
everyone under than 21 and deescalation is part of the training um and what type of uniform will they have they'll have
the uh light blue uniform with the patch on the side that'll say assistant school safety agent how will you be able to
differentiate them the patch and then also they won't have a shield on them
they won't have a shield and how many of these positions will be funded at so we
got approval for 400 and how do you how how you decide where you place them in the schools they'll be
placed in the elementary schools and that'll be determined with communication definitely collaboration with New York
City public school system as well as the incidents that there as well as the population and the funding will be is it
an intra agency funding between New York City public schools and NYPD just like school safety agents yes it is ma'am and
when um go ahead sorry just the exact salary for the school safety agent is 37,339
and why why um elementary schools just because they're just still coming out of
high school uh ele high school they're just graduating we figured elementary a
smaller environment younger kids it'll be an easy assimilation for them okay thank you thank you chairs just a note
uh it just came out last night it is out the link for the job so all can apply
that in that age group and we sent you the link ma'am thank you okay questions from Council Member
Hudson thank you chairs hello Commissioner i have several questions so bear with me here um in 2023 individuals
aged 60 and older across the country lost a staggering 3 60 or 16
60 lost a staggering $3.4 billion to fraud here in New York City our older
adult population has grown by more than 30% over the past decade and it's projected to grow another 40% by 2040 as
financial crimes become more sophisticated with advancing technology how's the NYPD using its budget to
protect one of our largest and most vulnerable populations i'm going to ask uh Chief Kenny our chief of detectives
who oversees financial crimes in those so in in a normal instance like this when the crime takes place the numbered
squad or the local squad would take that case but then the financial crimes task force would be brought in to enhance
that and then some instances even the major case unit would be brought in to follow up because a lot of these crimes
as we know leave to interstate um crime uh criminals so we also use our federal
partners as well so we do work very closely with the FBI and HSI in regards to financial crime do you think given
the um increase in population that's going to be expected over the next 15 years that perhaps resources should be
uh directed towards that division we we do fill in as as need be but you know as
we've been speaking about uh you know for majority of these hearings we are short staffing um that's why we do have
the numbered squads pitch in to help out when need be okay thank you
um the statistics you shared uh in your testimony about gun arrests and shooters
for children under the age of 18 are staggering yes in 2022 I introduced
legislation that would require the NYPD commissioner to provide guidance to its uniformed officers on determining
whether to use criminal enforcement or divert young people to a community-based organization to receive essential
services in lie of arrest and this has been demonstrated as successful in in precincts in Brooklyn our goal was to
provide young people with the services and resources they need that are pushing them to resort to crime has the NYPD
explored such a program and if not would you support such a program and does the NYPD have existing programs that divert
young people to programs or services in lie of arrest when criminal activity is identified so I I have not looked at
that piece of legislation from 2022 but if you'll give me just a few days I will take a look at it and happy to follow up
with you on it as for the diversion programs uh Chief Leetri is going to
speak to that good morning good morning so Good
afternoon good afternoon you've been here that long
when the police commissioner came in um she asked me to to to look at youth crime youth violence but also you know
how to deal with at risk youth prior to them committing a serious crime or a gun
rellated crime so one of the things that the NYPD instituted was the juvenile crime desk now falls under crime control
strategies my bureau and and we are an extremely datadriven bureau that that looks at not
just crime but looks at indicators that somebody might be either a victim or a
perpetrator in a crime this is specifically looking at juveniles so one thing that we are in that we will be
instituting is the ceasefire program with juveniles we've never done that before though some get mixed in but
we're primarily focused on adults so I think the ceasefire program including you know just with juveniles is
something that we can really really do well and when we start I can reach out to you and you can maybe come to uh one
of the meetings that'd be great thank you and um just so you know Commissioner it's intro 254 thank you
um the bill um a couple of um district specific
questions and then I have a broader question um are you familiar with a program
called to protect serve and understand that's put on by a performing arts group called Irondale i am not okay uh for
nearly a decade they've used theater to help police and community members build trust and understanding i went to the
you know 10-year anniversary celebration we had um former uh you
know folks from the police department i don't remember all their titles um but officers were permitted to attend the
sessions and participate in the 10-week long program however we've been informed
that um the NYPD earlier this month was cancelling this program um in order to
put more uniforms on the street the program only requires seven officers for a total commitment of 56 hours over 10
weeks and less than $20,000 annually to fund the program which builds trust in the community um if you're not familiar
with the program then I won't ask if you can explain why it was cancelled i'm not I'm not familiar with the program um but
each deputy commissioner and each burough chief has to make some really difficult decisions in um a tough
environment in terms of staffing and so the program that you're talking about would fall under our community affairs
bureau run by deputy commissioner Mark Stewart and so I recommend that you follow up with him on why he made the
assessment to cut participation in that program great we'll do thank you
um and then uh while Council Member Brewer continues to look for the Manhattan toebound I want to ask if you
have a plan to get both official and personal police vehicles off of pedestrian sidewalks at every precinct
in my district parked cars come right up to the tree pits which leaves space that's too narrow for me to pass with my
kids stroller let alone if somebody has a wheelchair um or a cane or some other type of mobility impairment and I'm
wondering if there's a plan to return pedestrian space to pedestrians and put police cars in proper parking spots and
even garages so in my mind I look at this in in two different two different pieces the first is the parking around
precincts the second is very basic citywide parking plaque
enforcement not in this specific area dealing with um with precinct parking
but like for example using a plaque to to leave a car like in a bike lane or
Yeah and I'm not even trying to address that i'm addressing specifically on the block of the precincts oh so you're
doing you're talking about category number one police yeah category number one police cars they're it's their
personal vehicles that when they come you know for their shift they're parking and it's it's perpendicular to the
sidewalks and half the cars on our um deputy commissioner of legal matters is overseeing the work in of this
department in this area okay so then there are a number of different pieces to this um and and you know there there
is a piece right which is a um a structural piece longterm in terms of just the parking setup around certain
commands there are just real challenges right we do need to have parking for the officers but from a compliance
perspective I want you to know that one of the priorities we have at compliance stat is this very issue so obviously
compliance we have to select you know what what are the compliance issues we're really focused on um and one of
them is parking around precincts uh we will devote time to you know we have um folks from professional standards going
out uh analyzing what's happening around precincts taking photos calling cos to
account right having them at the podium right and saying okay hold on you're the CEO of this command look at this photo
this is totally unacceptable for the reasons council member you articulated uh and I think we are affecting a lot of
change obviously we're happy to follow up in terms of the particular command yeah I don't think anybody's come and taken any photos of the the precincts in
my district I'm happy to provide the photos I'm happy to come out with the inspector whoever does the investigations
um but it's a it's a real issue and it's a multifaceted issue obviously each precinct is unique and the areas that
they serve and you know lack of parking and all of that but in some cases like in the 88 the cars are in the bike lane
and also you know the bus lane at times could be so we need to we need to know about that okay we we will definitely
focus on that both at compliance stat and with our newly centralized inspections teams whose job it is to go
out into the field and look for just that type of condition okay okay and one
other thing I do want to mention about that specifically is that in the 78 when some of the newer buildings went up as
part of Atlantic Yards there were uh parking spots allocated for the police department that are not used so our
deputy commissioner of management and budget is definitely going to be following up with you on that you got you got some somebody for everything i
love it yeah well we we had already reached out about that issue uh and so we will follow up to make sure that they
got the message okay and then just one uh friendly recommendation please as we
look to build new housing when the city is building city subsidized buildings one thing that I
fought for that I wasn't able to get was if you're already building parking spots or parking will be included in a
building and it's near a police precinct why not allow police cars to be parked
amen in that so glad we agree on that one um but that's like an internal agency to
agency thing i know i still say amen yeah yeah I know because the other agencies they don't want to give you all the parking um okay question about
overtime in your testimony you mentioned reductions in overtime including a combined savings of $40.4 million over
the just the first four months of 2025 compared to last year and you've also stated that none of this has come at the
expense of public safety do you have a goal in terms of the amount you're trying to reduce overtime or the cost of
overtime by uh or is there a specific number by which you're aiming to reduce overtime so essentially if we had
continued on the trajectory we were going we estimate that we would have spent over 1.2 billion about 1.23
billion in fiscal year 25 and our projection right now obviously there's still a month left in the fiscal year uh
is that we will be about 1.1 billion so
that you will be 1.1 billion over no that the total spend would be 1.1
billion versus 1.23 on a trajectory for for the for the 1.23 billion and that did not include in
the first half of the year the additional transit initiatives that we took on the second half of the year so
that's incorporating with this additional allocation of resources which is partially on overtime still being
able to bring that number down by about $130 million from what we projected would have been had we not put these
efforts in place to manage the overtime more effectively so is that the goal reduction by 130 from what we were
projecting yes okay and that's the goal for this fiscal correct and what will
the goal be for next fiscal so we are working right now with the office of management budget and internally to look
at what we think that'll be i mean our objective is obviously to continue what we've been doing and to continue to see
those reductions and to continue to see the the most effective use of our
resources so I I don't have that number yet but I I anticipate that we'll be you
know working to keep it as tight as possible we continue to do what we are
do what we've been doing since January in terms of management of overtime it is
somewhat inconceivable that overtime next fiscal year will be higher than this fiscal
year just because the first six months of the year there was so much spending
great that's good news um if the chairs will allow I'd like one more question thank you um what is the NYPD's current
clearance rate for major crimes and how do these rates shift when broken down demographically by race ethnicity or
neighborhood uh given persistent disparities in public concern what concrete steps are being taken to
improve transparency boost investigative performance and rebuild trust in the communities that are most affected by
serious crime that's a lot it is and I'm happy to repeat whatever you need no I I what I'm trying to say is that certain
you know every crime has a different clearance rate basically but I'll just give you um some highlights and some
some things that I am very proud of because of the collaboration with all the bureaus shoplifting is one of them
we we right now in some commands are seeing well over a 50% clearance rate in
shoplifting and and that's because of uh a very precise plan to look at
recidivists but also look at locations that repeatedly get hit so our but is
that sorry is shoplifting considered a major crime it could be it could be grand lararseny it could be petty
larseny or it could be also a robbery because people go in to steal merchandise and then use force upon
leaving it becomes a robbery if you look at if you look at the murders I mean you know historically we're at approximately
a 70% uh clearance rate and when you look 70 and when you look at you you
look at the burrow that has the best clearance rates it's the Bronx you know again because we put more detectives in
the Bronx we put more resources in the Bronx unfortunately because it's 37% of the shootings in New York City um when
you look at uh our robberies you know we're usually at a 40 to 45% clearance
rates on robberies so throughout the years uh I've seen throughout the five years that that I've really been honing
in on the data when it comes to clearance rates they've only they've only increased in in all of our majors
and also our our shootings and our uh shots fired um great if you can maybe
follow up with the the demographics by race ethnicity and neighborhood that
would be helpful i will give homework to my analysts thank you no problem you're welcome thank you okay just
acknowledging we've been joined by Council Member Rivera and with that we're going to uh close this out thank
you all very much for your testimony we look forward to working with you
and sorry and also and also Majority Leader Faras is here thank you all very much we'll take a 10-minute break and then
we're going to hear from uh Mach J
got to get that yep yep
somebody's going to give me like an email right from the He's giving me like an email from the office
so you're giving what what council woman was asking
thanks
okay welcome back everyone welcome to the second portion
of what is this day 12 day 12 of executive budget hearings who's counting
um Councilman Justin Brandon i am the chair of the finance committee i'm pleased to once again be joined by my
friend and colleague Council Member Salam who chairs the committee on public safety and we're joined uh for this portion by the mayor's office of
criminal justice uh we've been joined by Council Members Sanchez and Rivera um
welcome Director Logan and your team thank you for joining us today to answer our questions uh on May 1st the
administration released the executive financial plan for FY26 to 29 with a proposed FY26 budget of
$115.1 billion mach's proposed FY26 budget of
844.9 million represents less than 1% of the administration's proposed FY26
budget in the executive plan this is an increase of 60.6 6 million uh from the
originally allocated 784.3 million in the preliminary plan back in January this net increase is
mostly due to uh an increase in personal services spending uh as of March 2025 MACJ had 51
vacancies relative to their FY25 budgeted headcount my questions will
largely focus on Mach Jay's work with public defenders work with nonprofits that provide re-entry services and
overall funding issues and challenges uh sitting city contracting delays have long been a problem with our nonprofits
but these delays directly affect a person's ability to have a defense in court when they cannot afford
representation further questions will involve how Mach is upholding its agreement in the efforts to close
Riker's Island before we get started I again want to thank Jack Story and Casey Lysky Owen Katowski everyone from the
finance team uh back across the street at mission control and over here today for making these hearings possible i'm
now going to turn it over to my committee council Brian Saro who will swear everyone in and we can get started
good afternoon do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this committee and to
respond honestly to council member questions director Logan I do chief
Daniel I do officer Fiato I do and Officer Julian I do you may begin
go ahead thank you good afternoon good afternoon Chair
Salam Chair Brandon esteemed council members who are here in spirit uh thank you for the
opportunity to present our FY26 executive budget and priorities i'm
Danna Logan and I have the privilege of leading the mayor's office of criminal
justice joining me here today is our chief of staff Norah Daniel our chief
financial officer Robert Fiato and our chief operating officer Candace Julian i
imagine with all of the moving parts that are happening right now in New York City the evolution of our agency in
recent years may not be what's front of mind for the council and that's fine if
I at least get you all to remember that Mach is an essential service in the
public safety continuum that is designed to make a
difference not headlines the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice
is an agency and that's a big thing to say we are an agency on the rise doing
invaluable work to help reduce our jail population address hate crimes stop
those that seek to reduce our housing stock and make our neighborhoods safer by breaking cycles of criminal behavior
that plague New Yorkers we work with the office of court administration with defense attorneys with the district
attorneys to improve our justice system using data to innovate pilot programs
you won't find anywhere in the United States we empower justice justice
impacted New Yorkers to make safer transitions back into the community we
don't want anyone spending one day more or one day less in jail than necessary
at the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice we bring stakeholders together to create
solutions now we're doing it under our own standalone agency code as well
having completed a two-year transition that improved our information technology
human resources and oversight capabilities for the upcoming fiscal year our
executive budget proposes yes you've stated it hundreds of millions of dollars to sustain our vital programs
today I'll explain why that's not an expense but rather an investment for New
York City and the people of New York City our core programs that start off with
re-entry programs providing meaningful pathways for New Yorkers to successfully
return home from incarceration is essential for the benefit of both the
individual and the neighborhoods that they call home individuals with criminal records often
face immense challenges finding housing stable job access to medical care
continuing their education and just being supported in their humanity as
people and citizens our programs help bridge those gaps we allocate $26 million a year to
re-entry initiatives that include discharge planning while people are still on Rikers and in prison employment
support and comprehensive services after release to help stabilize life for
justice involved persons and their families our office also directs $32 million
annually to alternatives to incarceration efforts known as ATIs this program helps reduce
incarceration by offering structured alternatives to jail for more than 5,000
New Yorkers each year we address root issues like mental health substance
misuse while holding participants accountable connecting individuals to
important services while keeping them in their communities often with their
families helps lower incarceration rates recidivism rates and costs to taxpayers
the mayor's office of criminal justice lends leads pre-trial innovation including our successful supervised
release program that was introduced in 2016 supervised release gives judges the
option to release individuals with supervision into stable situations that
maintains them closer to their families similar to our alternatives to
incarceration we provide assistance in attending court accessing employment
services getting referrals for treatment when necessary thousands benefit from support
supportive supervision each year instead of sitting in jail
when I was here last month I told you about our pilot providing intensive support for high needs individuals
operating in Queens and in Manhattan this pilot is the epitome of how we use
data to innovate solutions individuals with higher needs must be supported by people with more
experienced clinical supports and expertise infusing highly specific person centered
care in our services means that more experienced clinical staff support fewer
individuals and thus increase the amount of time they spend with each client
addressing the client's specific needs in this pilot our ability to review the
research data and real time testing of the service models is yielding some very
promising early results including significantly lowering rearrest and
non-compliance rates we are looking forward to share more as the pilot
continues a foundational building block of stability is housing
without reliable place to leave your things and come back to individuals
leaving jail or prison are far more likely to spiral and find themselves
once again navigating the criminal legal system providing someone the stability
of a home they will be less likely to fall back into the cycles of crime
participants in our program are about 30% less likely to be rearrested in the
year after transitional housing compared to where they were the year prior to entering that transitional housing
this program evolved from a pandemic era emergency program into a remarkable
sustainable system that helps thousands of individuals every year with hundreds
of people leveraging that support to find stability but more importantly to
get safe permanent housing these programs work and a significant
part of this work that must not be forgotten is that the providers of all
of the services that we contract for are caring professionals who ensure that
they offer solutions centered on the people that they are
serving given the essential foundation housing provides we also fight to keep
the housing market affordable for all New Yorkers through the work of our office of special
enforcement their efforts to combat illegal short-term rental preserves housing for local renters and stability
for New York neighborhoods in the two years since council passed local law 18
and it took effect we've seen the world's largest online booking sites
remove illegal short-term rentals and return housing stock to New York from
their New York listings in partnership with the Department of Buildings and the Fire Department
they're ensuring residential spaces remain safe livable and most importantly
available to New Yorkers our Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes is small but mighty team
innovating new ways to tackle bias and hate and they're setting examples for
the rest of the country we work with the New York City Police Department community organizations other
stakeholders to educate deescalate and support affected communities we fund
grassroots initiatives under the partners against the hate program and we support the breaking bread building
bonds initiative launched by Mayor Adams mcj works hard to preserve a cornerstone
of justice for tens of thousands of New Yorkers equal access to legal
defense we coordinate the city's provision of criminal indigent legal services including convict council cases
that are handled by the assigned council plan working collaboratively with the state we ensure that the city affords
quality representation for all especially those who cannot afford
private counsel to better manage this work we created a
dedicated legal team focused on contracts and fiscal matters which
helped our finance staff register all not one but all contracts on time for
fiscal 25 for our indigent legal work and we're on track to repeat that
success in FY26 with dozens of mockj programs and
hundreds of MACHJ partners it would take me hours and I know that you're in lunch break so you don't want me to take hours
to detail all of the impact work that the impact our work is having across New
York but please indulge me with a few highlights that you should know about
one is Project Reset it's a fantastic second chance program helping low-level
nonviolent offenders avoid criminal records through pre-arrainment diversion
programs restorative justice is a program that uses the time-tested
strategy of bringing parties together to promote healing as well as public safety
project Restore Bedstey is a deterrence pilot that was a collaboration with the
Office of the Kings County District Attorney and Columbia University Social Relations Lab that afforded 30 young men
the agency to exit cycles of gun and gang violence and offered a new
deescalation model for cities everywhere flip the Script featured on Fox News
earlier this week is a program for justice involved youth in Brownsville who are now working apprenticeships in
the film industry and we are very much looking forward to them producing their own movie that is going to receive a red
carpet premiere later this year our CDL training and employment program
which last week was also featured nationally on CBS News for its stunning
success in helping justice involved New Yorkers get six figure jobs in the
trucking industry change is hard work and we're up for it we're doing that work while we
don't expect to fix every challenge in our criminal justice system we are making it fairer for the individuals in
the system we're improving safety and the health of communities across New
York City with a front row seat to how our investments are improving lives i
can confidently say your investment in the mayor's office of criminal justice
now its own standalone agency will help advance your constituents priorities as
well thank you for the opportunity to discuss our solutions and I look forward
to our continued partnership in advancing justice and safety
thank you very much for your testimony uh I want to jump right in here um
talking about contracts so a significant portion of MACHJ's uh FY26 executive
budget is allocated for contracts just wanted to go over some general info about uh Mach's contracting budget uh in
the preliminary plan back in January MACJ was allocated $135,000 in addition to baseline funding
for additional contract staff so could you tell us how many staff budgeted and actual do you have working to process
payments and contracts thank you i'll have our chief operating officer who has been dig diligently
working on staffing us up i'm very proud to say that we are very different place
of vacancies sitting before you today thank you for the question uh dedicated
to contracts we have uh 11 staffers
and what are the titles of those positions they range from our agency chief
contracting officer deputy agency chief contracting officer contract manager
senior contract manager contract analysts and we do have a Dcast pathway
fellows who is on the procurement and finance track do you would you like more
staffers or or is 11 enough to handle the capacity we do have 11 staffers we
have um a staffer in the onboarding process and one vacancy that we are in
the process of interviewing for so you're budgeted for 13 correct okay and
what's the average number of contracts being handled by each of those folks it varies by their uh seniority by their
title uh our contract managers can handle more complex uh um contracts
where they can manage upwards of 14 contracts uh and also it depends
on the task at hand um so uh yeah did you um have you designated a uh chief
nonprofit officer yes we have okay is that included in those 13 no
and who who is the chief nonprofit officer the chief nonprofit officer is the deputy agency chief contracting
officer for operations and what's the person's name monica Moy
okay and is that is that a standalone position or was it a responsibility
added to their existing role responsibility added to an existing role
how much of a city council discretionary award value is available to an organization immediately
can you repeat the question how much of a city council discretionary award is available to an organization immediately
going to defer to our chief financial officer yes chair it depends on when the contract is registered we have
approximately $24 million in city council discretionary contracts within the agency so it all depends on the
contract registration process uh for fiscal 26 as director Logan mentioned
we're on track for timely registration to begin the fiscal year on a good foot with all of our providers
okay um now that the cuts to uh alternatives
to incarceration and re-entry have been restored to the FY25 levels and the
points of agreement lists ATI as a priority to close Rikers is there any plan to expand funding for these
programs in the coming years
so through the um through the uh restoration to the FR25 levels we are
able to keep all of our providers whole and maintain the current services within ATI we continue to conduct research and
work with our research and development teams to make sure that we understand the needs of ATI so as we continue to
understand the data better and to get a better understanding of what's needed across the system we um that is
something that we will continue to discuss with OB and what's the current funding amounts for ATI and re-entry
services ati is budgeted at 54 million in fiscal
26 and re-entry is budgeted at 31.7 million in fiscal 26 as well
so and in light of potential federal cuts to Medicaid and other federal mental health funding um which we know
would directly impact the nonprofit providers who offer re-entry and discharge planning and mental health
related treatment has MCJ considered enhancing funds for re-entry and ATI providers
so we know that will likely I mean we are monitoring the situation we likely
would not have enough funding to be able to cover everything but we're continuing to monitor have you have you asked OM
for more money so we're continuing to monitor with our providers and our providers we're
continuing to work with them to make sure that they're able to maintain the levels of services that we have now okay
staying on the federal uncertainty as we know legal services are essential
service to the city uh especially uh facing attacks from the federal government on due process and
immigration and family separation um we also know that since the pandemic
nonprofit nonprofit legal service providers have suffered massive rates of attrition particularly uh among their
most experienced attorneys um nonprofits can't retain these workers and New Yorkers go without experienced lawyers
uh who remain and the lawyers who remain have unsustainable case loads so I know right
now uh many of these nonprofits are actively bargaining with their unions to reach fair contracts with wages that
will stay hopefully save off attrition some of these negotiations are heading towards contract expiration dates at the
end of this month or next month June um what is MACHJ doing to ensure that
funding is in place to meet the contract demands of these unions
thank you very much for the question chair we have been working with uh our indigent defense portfolio to understand
what their needs are and we've also been talking to our portfolio team at OM uh
currently as of this week the Office of Management and Budgets uh used gave each
one of our partners the flexibility to use some of the funding that they are
receiving for FY26 to address some funding for
additional salary increases for staff in order for retention and we continue to
work with the indigent uh defense portfolio uh teams to understand where
and how funding may or may not be needed so that we can have those discussions with OM and afford additional
flexibility okay so is OM aware of this concern i
mean obviously we want to you know stave off a possible court shutdown in July which would be chaotic um is OM aware
om is aware of the status okay um this last from me so in the FY26
budget uh the city allocated an additional 20 million for public public defenders performing criminal trials and
appeals work uh the intent uh of the initiative is to support staffing um in
uh the criminal practice uh while this funding is sorely needed Mach has limited how it may be used um is there a
reason why we're we're sort of tying public defenders hands by restricting the use of their
funding particularly because we're we're capping salary increases to 3%
much of the much of the the way that we as a city manage the
attorney pool that we have across the city is in giving everyone the ability
to give raises at a certain in a certain range and to make sure that we continue
to have par across providers and as we look at each of the providers as we look
at the market as a whole we will continue to review and see what makes
the most sense in how those those that flexibility is given again we continue
to talk to OM we look across where everyone is and we will continue to work
to what would be a fair and equitable resolution of of this okay am I correct
in that the city is limiting the city's basically the city is explicitly stating
uh that the funding cannot be used to support salary increases above the city's pattern of 3%
the city has been very clear that whatever the providers use their funding
for their overall funding is going to stay the same because that's where we are within the portfolio but there has
been flexibility in the ability to give raises
okay I'm going to turn over to uh Chair Salam thank you very much thank you Chair and good
afternoon going to start with uh changes changes to the plan in fiscal year 26
executive plan 14 positions are being transferred from various agencies into Mach J one from Administration of
Children's Services six from the Department of Corrections four from the Department of Finance and three from the
Department of Probation along with $559,369 in fiscal year 25 and $19
million baseline beginning in fiscal year 26 can you tell us what the purpose of
what was the purpose of this transfer and which programs or services will Mach be taking over from these agencies
thank you for the question uh as mentioned earlier um and as you're well aware of we are a new agency uh so the
transfer of headcount was a technical adjustment moving active staffers into
uh the newly formed agency um so there's no changes to services it was simply a
technical budget adjustment
and I'm not sure if this was already stated but can you please list the titles of each position that has been transferred
i will be able to send that to you after the hearing if that's possible thank you
definitely this plan reflects an additional $20 million baselineed for the city's public defenders which
includes $375,000 baseline for three additional personnel what three positions are being
added
the 375,000 is for agency operations and the three positions
funded are for our IT functionality human resources and
legal and how is the full $20 million increase being utilized to benefit public defenders
the mayor stated an intention with funding the $20 million increase is for the legal service providers to hire new
attorneys to assist with case load and intake assignment increases but as director Logan mentioned there is
flexibility for the providers to utilize that funding in accordance with their own internally identified needs um
working with ourselves and OMB to ensure that that money is spent in line with mock JS and the city's objectives with
promoting a fair and equitable indigen defense
system the plan includes $4 million in baseline funding for project reset what
specific services will these funds support
so project reset is early um it's pre-arraignment diversion so um it
provides services for um low-level misdemeanors um for people who are
entering the system that way moreover we just want to make sure that you're aware chair that not only does it
invest in people by providing them services it also is part of case
processing as the number of cases that are arraigned that uh each year is
reduced by the individuals that never actually get brought into the court system and so it is a vital part of not
only um serving New Yorkers but also ensuring that the criminal justice system is addressing the cases that they
most need to look at and keep us within our 24-hour time frame for arraignment
$5.9 million is reflected in this plan for human services cost of living new
need in fiscal year 2026 and 2025 and 2026 can you please clarify which
providers will receive these increases and why is this funding only included for two years
this is technically a technical adjustment for Mach so the human service
collo funding was announced last March by Mayor Adams and we were funded in addition uh initial allocation last
fiscal year the new need that you're referencing for 5.9 million is to essentially make us whole for that
funding and it affects most of our providers we
um have 159 contracts with 64 vendors so the vast majority of those vendors will
be eligible and are funded for the 3% increase in fiscal 25 3% in 26 and then
another 3% in 27
you said 3% through 27 3% annually beginning in 25 and then 26 and 27
okay I'm going to move to the points of agreement update this past
April and then again in this past this past Friday we received updates from MACJ regarding the points of agreement
which was originally created in 2019 upon reviewing the document I have questions concerning the methodology as
well as regarding the points themselves so the most recent update does not
include any financial or dollar amounts for the points listed but you have assured the council that you are working
on it so can we when can we expect to see funding amounts in these updates
we can get that to you at the at the next um update we usually update them
annually um and so we can add that add that to the next update and if you there's anything you'd like
to see sooner or anything we can provide to you we're happy to do so
and what was the methodology when creating this document are these updates a collection of responses from each
individual agency or did mockj compile these updates on on your own and did the
individual agencies report their status status complete status ongoing status
done with ongoing work or was that determined by MACJ itself
just to update my answer we're we're committing to updating the monthly now the the POAS and um we worked with each
agency to determine what the status of the specific um POA was and then
assigned a um and then we work with them to to make sure that it was accurate in
terms of how it's described
one of the points listed under MACHJ is the is this document is in this document
rather is to publicly track progress on commitments the 2025 update states that
MACHJ is committed to providing regular updates both in person and online considering that the April 25 update was
the first update posted since 2002 and then we received the following update within a month how often should
we expect updates in the future and if this was a priority for Mach J why is it three years before we received our first
update so we did have some staffing challenges
in terms of um some continuity issues but we are now committed to um to
updating them on a monthly basis
as recent at at a recent criminal justice hearing you said that you were working on additional on adding these
updates rather to your online tracker how has this process been moving
so for now we're updating it um manually with uh with a PDF but we are still
working through the IT challenges to be able to update the overall
website and we are continuing to post them on our website so will we receive funding
amounts in next month's update yes we can we can work on that
regarding the community justice and innovation fund the points of agreement states that the city funding match is
dependent on private dollars what work is mock J doing to find appropriate
funding sources so we are continuing
to tr try to find um appropriate private funding sources we currently have a unit
within mockj that works directly on um innovative pilots and so that is one way
we are continuing to work toward innovation um but we are committed to continue to work with um private funders
to to seek that funding i'm going to move to the council
budget response the council included several proposals in our budget response that emphasized recommendations made by
the Lipmani Commission in their budget blueprint to close Riker so my question
is how were the Litman commission's funding recommendations considered when
finalizing the executive plan and did you discuss these commitments with the Litman commission since the plan was
released thank you we were the benefit of
actually having Litman Commission folks kind of preview for us where they were in terms of the recommendations uh many
of the the suggestions and the recommendations in the report match a lot of work that is being
done now and so as we look at uh working with our weekly updates with DOC with
correctional health we are incorporating a lot of that work in that weekly meeting the the projects that have been
prioritized and funded for the Department of Correction meet some of the the
the areas that the Litman Commission highlighted very specifically case
processing is one of the areas that they highlighted and we are working to ensure that people who are detained are getting
access to the materials that they need in order to meaningfully help in their
own defense by having opportunity to review evidence and to annotate it and
to talk to their council about it in a more timely fashion which then supports
all of the work that Litman has been working with office of court administration and we too have been talking with the office of court
administration about how to timely move cases through the system and reduce the time that
people are spending on records the council called on the administration
in our budget response to expand the supervised release intensive case management pilot by providing an
additional $46 million per the Litman Commission's recommendation the executive plan
included an increase of $9.1 million in fiscal year 26 how was it decided that
this amount would be adequate to expand this program and what does this expansion entail and lastly what is the
rationale to fund this expansion for only one year
the $9.1 million you're referencing chair is a specific new need spitted by Mach for our intensive case management

okay first panel we have Pali Basat
uh Aracelda Skinner Arisa Skinner Jane Fox
uh Jesse Stefen and Juval Scott
jane you want to start is that working okay thank you uh good
afternoon my name is Jane Fox i'm the chair of the Legal Aid Society Attorneys Union i represent,00 attorneys out of
the 3,400 legal service workers at the association of legal advocates and attorneys we are UAW local 2325 and I'm
here to talk about the contract campaign that is happening right now at the legal aid society we have been bargaining with
the legal aid society management since March and have yet to receive any
economic offers from them in fact we found out this morning that earlier this week they told our sister investigators
unit that they will not have an economic offer until June 24th our contract expires in 32 days on
June 30th today our members are walking on practice pickets across four burrows and this afternoon we return to the
bargaining table for more negotiations and while we are committed to bargaining in good faith with our employers and
while we do not want to strike we are prepared to withhold our labor to win better wages for the long term and we do
not intend to work on an expired contract in March I testified about the
attrition crisis that is decimating our ranks our wages have not kept pace in
fact the salaries of New York City public defenders rank dead last among
defenders in 14 major cities when adjusted for cost of living we make a
sliver of what our union siblings at the federal defenders make we do not have a defined benefit pension and we are not
in the state retirement system and we are now also facing an attack on federal student loan relief programs that
threaten to burn up our salary gains and destroy hiring and retention in legal services for decades to
come budgets are value statements our clients workingclass New Yorkers deserve
the absolute best legal representation they do not deserve less than any rich
person in this city and if you'll permit me just to finish when you devalue us
you devalue the people we serve and if you continue underfunding us we will see the attrition attrition crisis speed up
your constituents will be increasingly represented by less and less experienced attorneys with higher case loads they
will not get justice and that is not accept an acceptable outcome to us and it shouldn't be acceptable to you by our
employer's estimate this council needs to increase funding to the Legal Aid Society by at least $74 million to make
sure our demands at the bargaining table are met and specifically at Legal Aid we are one union and our members are on the
same salary scale regardless of which court they practice in or which contract they are paid on public safety is more
than just public defense and that's why it's essential the city allocate can measure it increases in the adopted
budget to housing and immigration contracts so our employer can meet our core economic demands to retain
experienced staff and incre with increased salaries and provide a dignified path to retirement the money
our communities need for experienced attorneys and robust public defense is a fraction compared to what this council
and this city spends on law enforcement 250 million uh 205 million in 2024 for
NYPD settlements and as you heard earlier an estimated $1.1 billion in
NYPD overtime the funding we need is well within your reach you have the
power to value your own communities by investing in us and if in if negotiations do not improve in the next
month we are prepared to withhold our labor and interrupt essential city services to win a fair contract we are
fighting for us and for the working-class New Yorkers who deserve nothing less than than the best thank
you thank you very much hi and good afternoon my name is Arisa
Skinner i am the 911 operators from New York NYPD's local president i am here
again to testify that we are in a New York City crisis with the 911 operators
we are currently as stated this afternoon at a headcount of,210 members
a vacancy of budgeted allegedly at 1412 sir we don't have enough operators to
answer the crisis of New York City we don't have enough operators to dispatch New York City officers EMS or FDNY into
any locations of any of New York City the 911 operators are currently working
16-hour tours 5 days a week some are working four days a week 16-hour tours
operators handle about a million 10 million calls a year we don't have
enough they We're losing 60 to 80 operators every three months it takes us
three months to hire operators and to train them we're losing operators sooner than we are actually hiring them again
New York City is about to go into a crisis we do not have operators to answer your calls of emergency calls and
that's how simple I'm going to keep this testimony thank you
this is not about the uh MIPD it's more the FDNY but we were told we could come down here and um speak today speaking on
FDNYMS uh okay sure yeah okay so I just want to
start off by saying I don't represent the uh FDNY or local 257 um the people
of New York New York City um they're they're suffering because um EMS and um EMS has been um suffering
for a long time because you know they have a very high attration rate we um
taking a very long time to respond to jobs you know New York City is um failing us and the residents of the city
we we don't save property we don't stop crime we save lives it's an important job and in order to do the job
effectively we need more ambulances and personnel we are not responding to jobs on time because of a growing population
bike lanes increased traffic and a high turnover rate of personnel we constantly pump out new academy classes with new
EMTs that are gaining experience they learn the streets and perfect their patient care which takes years what
typically happens once they perfect their craft they end up leaving for better jobs and opportunities where they
will make better wages and better work conditions i am asking city council to
place the 50 million back in the budget as well as the 1 million for mental health for a stronger workforce that
will benefit the people of New York City thank you i agree there should be no uh
secondass first responders in the city we the the speaker certainly and the council believes that the uh city the
mayor should give EMS workers pay parody with other first responders so we're with you thank you yes and thank you
can I just add that uh I'd like my comments to be associated with the chair's comments in regards to
all of the testimony so far
thank you all very much okay our next
panel we have Lisa uh Shigersdorf Juval Scott Pali Basat
should we start hi um I'm Lisa Shriasor i'm the
executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services um we are representing all the public defenders um in New York City
today some of whom are here and some of who could not make it um we did want to
take this opportunity to um talk a little more about our overall budgets for the city for our work i know you
asked some questions during the MACJ portion so you're aware that um after our testimony at the preliminaries we
have done a lot of advocacy to uh get more money from the mayor's office and we're really glad to hear that they did
allocate $20 more million so I just wanted to clarify there are some
concerns with the way that that money needs to be spent but I feel like we probably can work that out um but I just
wanted to make sure that this is Excuse me this I just walked in do you mind give me a little water
um I just wanted to make sure that the city council is aware that our ask that
we really feel we need is probably another hund00 million or close to that and the reason is that we've been saying
for many many years that we need to match salaries of our staff to other
cities that are equivalent to New York such as LA and even some counties
upstate uh where people are being paid quite a bit more money that they can live in their you know home locations
and do their work in the places where they're serving people um and we're unable to do that at this point and in
order to meet those salaries what is currently about an $85,000 starting salary at all of our offices you know
they're all a little different but roughly really needs to be bumped up to about $100,000 because students are
coming out of law school they have large student debts the housing market in New
York is prohibitive and we are losing people we are losing a lot of people it is hard harder and harder to retain
people especially out around the third year so u we've done some computation again we can't be totally sure what it
would cost but we really believe that somewhere between I would say about $und00 million
more than the 20 that they gave us so we'll make very very good use of this but I we really are asking finance and
you know the city council in general to really try to negotiate for a little more money into our budget um you know
for the coming year but one of the issues where I think it's an important piece we're in an extension year where
we've had a contract for six years and all right it's good to have this little bit of extra money but um and I don't
want to poo poo $20 million sounds like a lot but it's you know it's not a huge amount for us but um we're worried that
when we go into the RFP year that if it's really really underfunded it's very hard to do proposals and to expect the
city to properly fund that project you know after the RFP comes in so it is
very important in this coming year for our baseline to go up a bit and maybe even in the following year so we
appreciate your attention and time and consideration thank you
hi good afternoon and uh thank you for making time for Oops can you hear me now thank you
good afternoon and thank you for making time for this panel my name is Juvul Scott and I have the privilege of leading the Bronx Defenders which as I'm
sure you know is located in the poorest congressional district in the country our office employs a holistic model and
there have been studies that demonstrate that the use of our model has been proven to lower rates of mass
incarceration through shortened sentences reduced incarceration rates um
and reduced pre-trial detention a study showed that our work has saved New Yorkers $165 million over 10 years and
more since then and we did that without harming public safety and that says nothing of
the cascading social and economic benefits of keeping people out of jail in their homes and with their families
and employed at the Bronx Defenders we're fortunate to attract some of this country's top talent to serve the 20,000
people per year who rely on our services and they've committed their their talent
to public service in one of the most expensive cities in the country being a public defender especially in this
moment it can be grueling the case loads rarely ease up the hours can be long the
emotional weight can be heavy and these are in combination with the soaring cost of living in the New York City area for
many who would love to choose a path in public defense or have a long career in public defense the pay is a barrier our
clients need my people focused on the people we served and not on whether they
can afford increased rents increased food costs and transportation because our pay remains
historically low and fails to keep pace with the rate of inflation public defender talent should be
properly valued and compensated and public defender offices can only do that if the city increases its funding for
public defender personnel doing so would demonstrate a true commitment and appreciation for the constitutionally
mandated services we provide on behalf of some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers in March we were here and we
asked the city to increase our personnel funding by 25% we made that we make that
same request today because a commitment to public defense commands more thank you
so I I'm going to be slightly redundant um and also personal my name is Pali Basic i'm the managing director for the
Neighborhood Defender Services of Harlem um and again I want to echo what everyone said really appreciate you know
the council has fought for funding increased funding that has made a difference but I think I want to echo what Lisa said that we do need more um
and the personal piece is I'm new to this role i became a managing director because I could not afford to just be a
public defender i supported my family on my salary we almost lost our home
because we just could not support a family on a public defender salary i'd
rather be in a courtroom than here today i I really would um it is a privilege to be here before before all of you but you
know our public defenders they are working because they are committed to the work um but the city needs we need
support from the city to properly fund their work and honor their commitment um
so and and you know I we have shared time and time again you know we have
staff who are single parents who are supporting their families it takes one
crisis to completely throw off the delicate balance that public defenders
maintain for for for any sort of stability um so again I I we know that
you are our allies and friends in this fight and we just ask that you continue to fight for more funding um I'm going
to completely pivot now to policy um you know last time we were here Council
Member Salam you had asked us about discovery you know we have um you know I
think that we are concerned we hope that the council will continue maintaining the fair and transparent discovery laws
um that we have fought for um and you know there are concerns that there might
be potential push back um to roll back discovery in the city and we just ask
for the council's continued commitment to ensure that the process remains fair um and that is somewhat a little bit
related to what else I'm going to talk about and I I know this is a budget hearing but I think this is important
issue to raise and that is the issue of DATs um and the reason I'm raising this
is because it is actually related to discovery reform and there have been a lot of conversations about discovery
reform dat reform occurred at the same time um which was that the NYPD is
required to issue DA DATs now for certain offenses um they're everything
from public uronation to just sitting taking up space um in the subway um and
yet what we are finding across all the burrows um in some burrows more than
others um and I don't have statistics for you today but we are working on that is that DATs are not being given for
those offenses and instead people are being arrested and being brought to arraignments um and you know this was
again something that we fought hard for because this is an issue that disproportionately affects black and
brown New Yorkers um and it is disproportionately affecting the most poorest of New Yorkers given the level
of offenses um and so we wanted to flag this issue for the council more just to
flag this issue it's an issue we are paying attention to and I think the council should also be paying attention to this issue um and we will continue um
raising again I apologize I don't have the statistics um we are going to be working on that and we will be coming
back to you all with more information for that thank you thank you all very much uh Council Member Brewer
thank I'm sure you'll save uh share that with us and when you get the statistics but are you also having a breakdown
nobody can ask somebody whether they are documented or undocumented at least for
city agencies which is a good thing but I am very nervous about uh individuals who don't have documentation because I
worry about ICE so I'm just wondering if that is also an issue that comes across your desk like okay I'm just that's my
issue so we find the increase in using uh not issuing DACs when they should is
across the board but the impact on people Turn your mic on oh sorry um it
seems to me pretty much across the board that they've reduced the use of DATs
uh beyond like what's even legally required but um there does seem to be a
much more dispionate impact as your right to notice for people who not only are undocumented but even people who
just happen to be immigrants and we've been in situations where um once that person is in jail and they're in that
process from arrest to arraignment um they've contacted other counties who are already cooperating with the with ICE
and maybe finding warrants or what they call IC cards which is sort of a wanted thing and like they've had them come and
pick people up right from arraignments so I do believe it is a tactic in some ways to try to round some people up that
they couldn't otherwise um but I also I think it's also impacting people who are
not in that status at all and you know not only is it horrible for people it
slows down the system and it impacts every single person who's in jail the times go up when you have too many
people in that system and it also impacts our own staffing i I don't want to be totally you know selffocused at
the moment but it is very different to represent somebody who's in jail versus somebody who's not in jail and it just
contributes to the kind of work that our staff will always step up to do um but
that you know is difficult you know for us to continually uh fund with our current
resources thank you thank you very much
okay our next panel we have Ruth
Loenron Kevin Maestrich Maya Kreman Michael
Greco Megan French Marcelen and Haley Nelasco
just give us one second
okay Mike you want to
start how you doing good afternoon everybody uh thank you for letting us speak my name is Michael Greco i'm the
vice president of local 257 we represent the FDNY EMTs paramedics and fire
inspectors uh the reason for me coming today was first of all to uh thank you and address the recommendation of the
$50 million in the budget um I've been coming up my president has been coming up for the past nine years speaking of
the inequities that are going on in EMS and uh a month before COVID started back in
uh March of 20 2020 I stood in front of this council and stated that if the call volume hit 6,000 calls a day that EMS
would be decimated sure enough it proved to be correct we had a call in the National Ambulance Service and we all
saw what CO brought when the city gets hit with so many medical calls we're now at that level now and it seems the mayor
or somebody is not listening to the screams going on we're in contract
negotiations we're getting nowhere uh the fight for pay parody is real and the
suggestion of the influx of money that the council has suggested would not only help but I think they're not looking at
the savings that it would bring we're hiring 600 people a year and we're losing about 550 so we're probably the
only agency over the 10 past 10 years who has hired 150% of their budgeted
headcount um simple math it's cost about $10,000 to train one EMT if you just
look at the uh uniforms and if you just look at the books that's not including salaries at 600 uh a year you're looking
at millions and millions of dollars that's being wasted on training this response times are shooting through the
roof um and we thank the city council but we we ask for even more we we need
the pressure our our service is losing members left and right our training is atrocious when it comes to after they
get out into the field there's no secondary training that comes on so I
once again am here to make the call to you guys um I thank you Justin i know you've been a big advocate of us but uh
I I'm I'm re-energizing the call to help save FDNY EMS thank I'm not I'm not sure
how much you're allowed to divulge but is OLR still refusing to recognize EMS
as a uniform service that is correct it was one of our major demands and they will not offer us the uniform coalition
pattern and they will not move above what the opening offer was day one of
the contract and when the mayor was running for office didn't he promise to get this done day one it's now been
over,200 days thank you thank you thank you
hey hello good afternoon Chair Salam Brandon and Council Member Brewer my name is Haley Nolasco and I'm the senior
director of government relations at the Center for Justice Innovation thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today true safety requires sustained
investment in communitydriven solutions focused on prevention and fair intervention that do not solely rely on
law enforcement we thank the council and the administration for their ongoing support and for the restoration of funding for Project Reset its early
intervention for low-level non-violent offenses we thank you however recent federal funding cuts have impacted us
and continue to threaten critical services particularly those that prevent violence and provide healing and
accountability in the communities we need the most that need them the most we're already feeling the impact in some
programs like our community violence intervention and community neighborhood safety initiative work today I want to
highlight a few examples in need of continued support in the South Bronx we are seeking funding to develop a fully operational Bronx Community Justice
Center where we continue to encounter unfunded opportunities to address community safety needs in the Bronx
other programs such as our rise project as well as the Staten Island and Queens community justice centers offer essential gender-based services to
respond to domestic violence and its intersection with gun violence and also provide alternatives to incarceration we
urge the council to continue investing in programs such as these to ensure that service gaps do not disrupt any
community- based organizations vital support to co-produce public safety across our great city thank you so much
thank you just turn your mic off thank you good
afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to testify today my name is Yurelles Leonardo manager of re-entry
services at Getting Out Staying Out a re-entry and antiviolence program that has served more than 15,000 people over
two decades at GOSO we work directly with 16 to 24 year old young people who
are incarcerated in Riker's Island juvenile facilities people in the community who have been directly
impacted by the criminal justice system and those who are at risk i focus on
developing strategies that empower them to reintegrate successfully overcome
barriers and ultimately build a future free of incarceration and that's why
everyone at GOSO is very grateful for the city council and the city support that allows us to do critical
antiviolence work for participants citywide go cure violence intervention
community- based education mental health job readiness and paid internship programs have reduced violence and led
to better outcomes for the people we serve while gun violence is still a serious problem in our community we are
proud to say that the area in East Harlem that we serve has seen gun violence dropped to the lowest level
since 2019 in GOO's community program 93% of
the young people we serve do not return to jail go responded to increased needs
from court involved and formerly incarcerated youth for treatment of anxiety depression and PS PTSD by
opening an in-house mental health clinic in partnership with the child center that provides robust services including
psychiatric care we created new literacy and STEM programs and a third of our
STEM participants will start college this year we rely on city and state
federal funding as well as foundation and private grants and we and we're able to expand programming in part because of
a federal department of justice community violence intervention and pre prevention initiative multi-year grant
in 2022 however this April we unfortunately received news that our
ongoing grant for the DOJ has been rescended and we lost almost 250,000
that has already been budgeted for this fiscal year antiviolence and core community program we are not the only
organization impacted by DOJ cut antiviolence program around our city lost millions of dollars in funding
while we ensure that our program continues they will be impacted and will need to rely on city funding more than
ever to ensure that all participants who need services can get them thank you
thank you
good afternoon ruth Loenrron i'm the director of the disability justice program at New York Lawyers for the
Public Interest and I'm also a member of Correct Crisis Intervention Today New
York City which has as its sole mission transforming the way New York City
responds to mental health crisis and that's what I'm going to talk about today i'm going to show you in a visual
the problem i've also handed this out to you it is very very stunning bleak
information these are 21 individuals who've been killed at the hands of the
police when the police responded to a mental health crisis this is not
pointing a finger at the police but there is something radically wrong when 21 people end up dead
police are not the right people to respond to a mental health crisis you wouldn't send them to respond to a heart
attack or not to send them to respond to a mental health crisis and we luckily
here in New York have um and and by the way it's not at all
limited to deaths we have serious injuries we have people who are arrested
and involved in the criminal legal system who otherwise wouldn't be we have people who are committed to hospitals
over objection who otherwise wouldn't be so we need to transform this yes there
is an attempt to do something about it by the city to remove police wherever
possible but in fact that program is lacking in many many ways it's the be
heard program you may have seen the report that just came out from the con
New York City controllers's office condemning the program greatly i will just say it has hope if it can be
revised in the ways that I'm setting forth in my written testimony that I'm providing to you i'll just say one two
more quick things please um what's critical is that be heard be available
24/7 it's only open 16 hours a day how can you respond to crisis in that short
amount of time and it is also does not include peers individuals with mental
health crisis lived experience whom we are saying are the best people and the
literature will tell you the best people when trained to do that work and that's
what we're pushing right now for the city council to add peers to that and
there's a budget line of $4.5 million to in fact add peers to programs generally
we want to make sure that that 4.5 million is just the beginning of adding peers individuals with live mental
health experience to the Be Herd program and also following our other recommendations for uh revitalizing the
Be Herd program which is greatly in need of it but certainly for eliminating the police in all but the rarest of
circumstances thank you sorry put me in the corner for a reason
um good afternoon uh thank you so much my name is Megan French Marcelen i am
testifying on behalf of the New York City Alternatives to Incarceration and
Re-entry Coalition and I came here today from Fortunes Castle um which hopefully
many of you have visited um where we met with 16 of New York State's parole
commissioners and they said that as they're making determinations about parole they look at one thing are people
connected to our services because they know if they are that they will be
successful and thriving in community we are public safety we're effective public
safety we're proven public safety and we're evidence-based we provide housing
employment job training substance use treatment mental health treatment a lot of my colleagues are on this panel and
our ask is additional $2.4 million to do this work now I want to put that into a
a bigger picture $2.4 4 million is 10%
of what the DOC allocates for overtime every single month 2.4 million res uh
dollars in additional resources allows these programs to thrive and I'm just going to give a couple examples of of
our statistics 97% of Bronx Connect youth do not have another conviction
three years later Osborne's court mitigation programs saved the city
$162 million in incarceration costs last year and CAS's fact team which works
with serious mental illness um through an ATI program has a
100% non-residetism rate now that is far more uh effective public safety than
Rikers and any other program that the city has so we we look forward to
working with you to expand these services thank you so much
thank you anyone left to testify okay thank you all very much
thank you okay okay our next panel is William
Metting Carolyn Lewis Ree Ramadan Hannah Hannah
Jang Maryanne Caldi and Daphne Thomasilla
you can begin when you're ready thank you thank you thank you Charles um for the opportunity to speak today my name
is William Medina i'm a proud leader of the love of deliverist unidos and organizer with the worker justice
project but more than that I'm a delivery worker i'm someone who rise through the city every day to earn a
living to provide for my family to survive i'm here today not just an advocate but as someone who is living
this reality and I'm speaking to you with outrage frustration and heartbreak
during the pandemic people call us heroes they clap for us thank us for
keeping the city running but now on the New York PD new policy it feels like
we've gone from being heroes to being treated like criminals this new New York
PD policy is targeting delivery worker like me i'm just first two weeks more
than a thousand criminals were handed out to cyclists most of them delivery
workers that means if I'm on my bike I roll through a red light maybe because
I'm rushing to meet the liberty time the app is pressure me to meet i could give
a criminal court summon think about that a criminal summon for a traffic violation that put us into the criminal
justice system many of us for the for the first time no lawyer no support just
fear some workers are scared not even show up in court because of possible
contact with ICE others show up and are told because at administrative errors
they have to come back another day lossing work lossing income and adding more street to our already difficult
lives and what worse this someone said can trigger background checks by the apps causing worker to be deactivated
just like that our only source of income is gone what's happening is not about keeping
the street safer if it were car driver will be treated the same way but they're
not this policy target by riders us and that discrimination is unjust that we
make and mistake were criminalized while cars for more dangerous don't face the
same consequences i'm asking the New York City to stand with us we don't need
criminal criminalization we need real solution we urge you to you're the end
of New York PD criminal summons policy targeting cyclist invest in safe by infrastructure and a strong labor
protection for deliverista hold up delivery companies accountable for the unsafe condition they create thank you
for listening thank you go ahead
can you hear me okay I can hear you thank you um good afternoon my name is Carolyn Lewis i am the vice president of
tribal and law enforcement affairs for the national or national child ID program i'm coming to you because we
have a critical and a a serious case going on throughout the country i'm sorry thank you the um you
know we have over a thousand kids that go missing every day every single day and we don't have you know it's not
being talked about it's not being addressed so if I may I I provided a child ID kit the na the national child
ID program started in 1997 when Amber Hagman went missing that's where the Amber came from and um with um with the
help of our NFL partners Hall of Fame they started this program down in Texas giving out over 25,000 kits these kits
do not go in a database they do not be they are not given to any authorities these are solely for family members to
hold on to these kits in the event that their loved ones go missing and if I may just take a minute just to read a couple
of things so basically that this this kit is a comprehensive for comprehensive
information it allows you to do your own fingerprints has decentralized fingerprint in there it has a three card
stock that you could fill out for yourself your families and you know you can look at it on your own um what we're
asking is that um we're asking for your help to seek to raise a million dollars
for a manufacturing grant which would allow us with this we to to excuse me would allow
us to manufacture more kits to be distributed here in New York now if you match let's say for argument sake you
give us a million dollars the National Child ID will match dollar for dollar which would be $2 million which would be
$650,000 kits that could be distributed throughout the city preferably to our students we are focusing on bringing
this this nationwide is actually global i personally have given out over 450,000
kits nationally nationally and we look forward to continuing this i have given a letter which my my personal
information as well as the executive director's information is on there and hopefully we can get a million dollars
so that we can take care of our kids because basically our their their safety is our f their future is our safety and
um their safety is our duty so thank you for the time

New Yorkers is under threat like never before escalating anti-immigrant policies ICE encroachment on local
authority and ongoing anti-Asian hate have created deep fear especially in immigrant communities as an anchor
organization we provide culturally competent language accessible programming and services that address
hate violence in conjunction with our sub anchors current services are running well as they have been for the past four
years and making changes now while New Yorkers feel heightened fear and anxiety about public safety would get in the way
of past success since the start of the program we've trained over 200 community members in safety techniques provided
over 990 community members with protective presence and accompaniment services and we've recruited over 400
volunteers to provide safety services in Asian majority neighborhoods despite its success our path funding was cut by
$30,000 per anchor for FY26 we respectfully urge the council to restore full funding for path to the anchors and
increase public safety investment to meet community needs and increase funding for antiviolence and immigrant
safety programming like our hope against hate campaign at a time of continued hate violence and rising fear this
reduction in funding jeopardizes vital programs and safety services risk cutting off access to healing and
support for some of the city's most vulnerable residents and contradicts the city and the council stated commitments
to safety equity and wellness for all New Yorkers we've spent many years building infrastructure to provide this
safety programming and the challenges faced by our community to demand long-term investment in public safety thank you for your support and the
opportunity to testify thank you
good afternoon my name is Mariam Khali and I'm the advocacy and civic engagement manager at the ArabAmerican
Association of New York since 2001 AANY has fought against the continued rise of
hate crimes against our communities and in 2021 we joined the Partners Against the Hate Forward initiative under the
Office of the Prevention of Hate Crimes tripleny and our grantees have led hundreds of self-defense trainings
trained thousands of community members in bystander intervention and deescalation tactics provided hate
crimes prevention workshops and resources to thousands of New Yorkers and advocated both on the local and
statewide level for legislation that protects our communities from hate violence one of our grantees Council on
American Islamic Relations New York has been collecting data on hate crimes against Palestinian Arab and Muslim New
Yorkers many of which go unreported to the NYPD and city offices since October
2023 they've received 290 reports of hate crimes or bias incidents against
community members on the basis of their identity as Palestinian Arab or Muslim or for showing pro Palestine solidarity
including 134 from students in the K to2 and university levels at NY we've seen
firsthand the scope and and trauma of this hate violence we've worked with clients whose hijabs were ripped off
mosques that were vandalized with hateful words and much more our organization has also faced hate crimes
including threats of physical violence and our staff has experienced harassment stalking and threats because of our
identities and the work that we do the PATH program allowed us to serve thousands of clients and provide
supports to hundreds of victims of hate despite the program's success each path
anchors funding was cut by 30,000 for FY26 by OPC at a time of hate rising
fear and with a federal administration spewing anti-immigrant hate our services are needed more than ever and so we
asked the NYC council to increase investment in our safety work to meet the needs of our communities that we
serve and the funding be restored for the path path initiative tripleny has been and will continue to be on the
front lines working to combat hate violence promote community safety and we hope that the New York City Council will
continue to support us in doing so thank you thank you very much
peace hello good afternoon my name is Ree i'm the director of community organizing and public advocacy at the
New York City Anti Violence Project AP ap is a direct service and advocacy
organization we serve LGBTQ survivors of violence we have a 247 bilingual hotline
where survivors can access our free counseling and free legal services and
we also engage members with community organizing and leadership development trainings we envision a world where
LGBTQ and HIV affected people are safe and live free from violence and we are
the only LGBTQ specific victim services agency in the city
it was in this very city that the Stonewall uprising happened in 1969 where LGBTQ people have had enough
and made it known that we deserve to have the same level of safety as everyone else while that sounds like a
distant time it is unfortunate that the fight must still go on to this day LGBTQ
people experience hate violence at a higher rate than our straight and cisgender counterparts and because LGBTQ
identity lives at the intersection imagine the compounded violence that a person experiences if they are bipok if
they are immigrants if they are houseless and if they are formerly incarcerated especially now with the
current federal administration LGBTQ people are a target of harmful policies
the roll back of federal protections against discrimination in health care and education targeting trans people and
their access to gender affirming care and even legislation that bans LGBTQI
inclusive curricula in schools if there is any respit in this it's that we're in
New York that the very place that the Stonewall uprising started and we must
honor that legacy we call on you members of the city council thank you for being here for hearing us and we and we call
for your support let's make it known that New York City doesn't have a place for hate or harmful policies and let us
put those words into practice as another anchor or of the path forward initiative
we ask to increase the funding to ensure that the anchor orgs uh get their
funding restored by the 30k that was cut and to increase the hate violence prevention initiative to support the
organizations working with the communities most vulnerable to violence and to reallocate funding from law
enforcement agencies to community- based organizations that offer culturally competent services that speak their
language and that offer lifesaving services and to invest in community safety education healthcare and housing
for all thank you
thank you to Tier Brennan and Chair Salam and the committees on public safety and finance for the opportunity to testify today my name is Hannah Jeng
and I serve as a community outreach advocate for the Korean-American Family Service Center for over 35 years KFSC

culturally and linguistically accessible services at KFSC we see firsthand how domestic violence sexual violence child
abuse and AAPI hate harms physical and mental health in our community our
clients primarily Korean and other Asian immigrant women often face violence isolation shame and fear when seeking
help as a leader in seeking to end violence of all kinds KFSC has joined the Partners Against the Hate Forward
initiative to keep New Yorkers safe i'm testifying today to both acknowledge the current investment in the city has made
in hate violence prevention and to also ask for increased investment in public safety the PATH program has allowed us
to create safely programming responsive to community needs respond quickly to crisises with wraparound case management
and connections to long-term mental health services offer community workshops to educate community members
on how to keep themselves safe during times of violence and more we provided hundreds of safety resources to
community members engaged nearly 100 volunteers in trainings and safety events and conducted 15 inerson events
through this program kfsc respectfully urges the city council to invest in community-based organizations that
deliver culturally and linguistically competent services for immigrant families and to increase funding for
initiatives that directly support AAPI communities and broader community safety
specifically we ask that you invest in the hate crime prevention initiative which supports community-led efforts to
address trauma and bias fueled violence and restore full funding for PATH sustain and expand funding for the
immigrant mental health initiative to help reduce stigma and promote access to care in immigrant communities continue
supporting the AAPI community support fund which has been critical to reaching survivors who are often overlooked

service models at KFSC we are committed to ensuring that every survivor of violence can access mental health care
and services that speak their language understand their culture and honor their resilience we urge you to stand with us

okay our next panel is Richard William Flores Liia Galupa Constant Lold
Christopher Leon Johnson and Y jennins
Constance you want to go first or actually pass the mic pass the
mic to your left you can go yeah let's go let's go uh right to left me
come help me what's wrong hello i spoke here in February and I spoke
here in April stalking issue last night I had
to call 311 cuz the man above me has been electrocuting me gave me my heart attack
and today I'm now working on my third one 232 i called 311
K4207 i've been stalk since May 11 2006 i reached out to the wonderful Salam sir
Salam last year reached out to many wonderful people to no avail i lost 19
years of my life if you dare to spend one day following me it's pretty scary i don't go out
anymore uh the wonderful Jessica Tish that was here with with what's his name matt Frasier the one here was it Siana k
I N S E L L yeah all these wonderful people get the same email
wilds W I L E S and Levit the White House Pam Bondi DOJ Stacy Lynch 15 plus
emails the same email about the stalking taunting harassment of me now 19 years
two heart attacks and the man above me how do you put it nicely is trying to kill me the vibrating electric
underneath me I have sore ears now very sore ears and there's not a part of my
body that's not in pain and And I have a lump here i have a whole issue of things
that went to the mayor to the governor but most of all that man who read 10
letters today Obama who got a letter a day from me for eight years to this day
5,000 plus letters have gone to the White House and every bus and train camera i just sat here today as you
notice and not move as everyone crept around me i had to behave myself and allow it cuz I can't do anything about
it mr jennings I've been asked y'all for help from the days of what's his name raymond
Diaz bronxboro president yeah to now nothing the wonderful Jessica Tish thank
you very much constance
my name is Constance Leold and I'm not officially representing anyone today but
um as you know from my prior testimony
um Chairman Brandon um I'm very involved
with senior citizens centers and Um I would have hoped to have with me my
partner at 966 uh Grace Hairgood uh Senior Center of of the Fort Green Group
uh because we had uh begged for help from the Department of Transportation in
regard to the ebike and the bicycles and the motorcycles and everything else issues
um and uh we didn't get any answer from the department of transportation uh but
I do have to say that uh the uh problems have uh somewhat it would appear to the
this pedestrian um and others have improved over the
last years so uh I have to look at
Jessica Tish's testimony seriously um I I am very sympathetic
uh to the community that is faced with
um ICE threats and in some ways that includes all of us uh I just got a
request last night to help a church in Newberg New York uh where I uh went into
a uh service without notice and took out
six people uh that church is hoping to organize churches uh I just say this
because I am very involved um with a lot of issues around ICE and I am
sympathetic but I am not sympathetic to the idea that documented
or undocumented workers uh have the right to go through a red
light and endanger the lives of the pedestrians um no everybody has to go by
the laws and if it t and if there is no
consequences when they don't [Music] um we don't get any improvement i I I
just have to say that uh the fair evasion issue the
uh the transit authority is charging too much for the city and whatever you can
do on these issues um within the budgetary way uh do it and
and with the Franklin Avenue shuttle please uh look at the issues of graffiti
uh where the great artwork is uh being uh damaged by I am told by the police
white troublemakers and um they have faced no
consequences um the assembly person has taken the artwork down and um Thank you
very much yeah it's just that um they came right back again uh so that the
police are not um they are not protecting our precious
artwork at Franklin and Fulton that we all work so very hard for thank you
thank you very much ladies
Liza go ahead oh there you go okay thank you um thank
you so much chairs uh Ysef Salam and Justin Brennan for the opportunity to speak my name is Liha Walpa i represent
the Workers Justice Project in Losista and today I'm here to call out
and condemn the new NYPD reason policy that targets cyclists particularly
delivery workers with criminal summons for traffic violations let let's absolutely be clear this policy is not
about public safety is about criminalizing immigrant workers the people who actually feed and keep every
New Yorker safe this crackdown is not is is not just shameful it's outrageous and
dangerous it sends a clear message that our city will rather punish workingclass people rather than holding accountable
multi-billion dollar corporations like Uber Door Dash GrubHub companies that have created a system
where workers are forced to deliver faster take her more risks and put their own safety on the line in order to avoid
being deactivated or losing their own their income that they have today I heard NYPD commissioner claim that
criminal that civil summons uh were not too harsh enough and that in the name of
public safety criminalizing delivery workers and cyclists is ultimately necessary that's outrageous and that's a
lie let me be clear and let me share with you delivery workers have always been a
target of excessive traffic enforcement this has already cost thousands of dollars in civil summons to delivery
workers hitting where it hurts the most their pockets their family income so
this enformentment this this now turning this criminal summons in this civil summons into criminal enforcement it's
painful and the idea that criminalizing on the name of his of of public safety
it's um it's a complete lie and here I am asking to you for your support we
need to condemn these type of policies and really address the roots of the core issues what workers really need is
protected bike lanes safe and accessible bike parking designated delivery zones
so they don't have to be blocking traffic or uh being in the pedestrian areas battery swap charging stations and
a community center approach that is not about criminalizing but educating protecting workers from the algorithm
systems that are exploiting our own people and hardworking New Yorkers we look forward to working with you joining
forces to uh calling out to the end of these harmful policies and building real
solutions that is about caring for the people that care with that care for
every New Yorker during the pandemic instead of treating them as criminals
thank you i'll go uh hello chairs brandon chairs salam my name is Christopher Leon Johnson and I'm here to
support the deliveristas um I'm here to support these two nonprofits here a shout out to the street bender project for giving me this pen at the small
business fair and the workers project giving me this pen at the fair too all right so I want to make this clear that
look this these um policies that t um just tish has done on behalf of her mother is really racist and
discriminatory against theistas what this does is put these guys and gals in danger with immigration because a lot of
you guys don't have papers and all it's going to do is open them up to ICE and I'm calling to the city council to make
a statement with all the members that really care about these deliveries on this in the situation to really condemn
um Jessica Tish for what she's doing on behalf of her mother she's not doing this on behalf of street safety because
if it was for street safety it would be for everybody but she's doing this on behalf because her mother complained so I'm calling on the city council to
really condemn Jessica Tish for doing this to to these um the resisters i am calling on the city council to um find a
way to demolish that new stand right outside city hall and install that deliverista hub on behalf of the work
justice project why are you not guys not doing this yet for i I don't get what's going on here at the same time I'm
calling under the city council to make sure that the work justice project and the street project still keep their
funding in the FY26 cycle because there's a lot of internal stuff that's going on and I believe they should keep
they should still keep their funding for what they do for the city of New York um and another thing is that um tomorrow at
6:00 at Union Square there's going to be a critical mass bike ride down the down from Union Square to City Hall and I
hope that you Mr justin Brandon show up or send one your stat to show up and show you in solidarity to the theistas
that are getting harassed by the NYPD and one more thing is that we need to abolish Cop City for the FY27 cycle we
need to find with the ball cop city because the deliveristas and the street vendors are being are going to be
harassed more with the help of the NYPD and another thing is that um we have to
stand with our deliveristas we have to stand with uh all the resistance in the city they shouldn't be discriminated
because they run a bike down the street they're essential workers i know i know i know you had to go they're essential workers they deliver pills they deliver
medicine i have family my that's sick and I don't want anybody even my worst enemy to not be able to get medicine
because theista get arrested because they don't some don't know the language barrier or the um and some might resist
and they might be the oh why I can't get my pills because the person that deliver my pills got arrested by the NYPD so
thank you so much thank you thank you sir right
thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify to the city council especially to council member Justin
Brennan who has been present at the last three testimonials that I've made here in the month of
May uh Commissioner Tish and the NYPD testimonials today while explaining
all of the efforts to combat reductions in crime i don't feel are being assessed
accurately by this council or by the NYPD or other municipal agencies
including the Department of Inspection Internal Affairs Bureau Department of Homeless Services Department of Social
Services HA Health and Hospitals and even the Social Security
Administration and other federal agencies including the DOJ FBI and CIA
in the month of May alone I have been targeted as a victim of crime experiencing both physical and sexual
assaults on the streets of New York with no official resolution by the NYPD or
other agencies namely the DOI and the IAB or even agencies like the CCB
these assaults were particularly violent on one occasion as I mentioned just the other day a young college-age person
kicked a MTA glass partition uh glass
repeatedly with the objective of shattering it which I believe is a form of biochemical terrorism as far as the
safest Memorial Day in terms of zero shootings uh a criminal doesn't need a gun to kill someone i was physically
assaulted in broad daylight at 17 State Street outside of a building where I used to be employed again as I mentioned
as a CCR agent for a company called Shareholder Communications from 1995 1998 and 2001 where I witnessed the
attacks at the World Trade Center on 911 i reported this assault from Memorial
Day to the first precinct i was told by an officer um who uh did not and they
did not officially take the incident report i was told and asked by the
officer at the first precinct whether I called 911 after the incidents i believe this
is ridiculous and absurd the budget hearing is on what the NYPD policies are
doing to combat crime in NYC and specifically Commissioner Tish and the NYPD and their affiliates should go over
and beyond this meeting to have a sincere and factual account of what
measures are being taken to ensure the safety of lawabiding American citizens
thank you very much thank you okay our next panel thank you
thank you all we have Adriana Rivera and David
Cook after this you have like one more
thank you bro see you tomorrow okay good luck thank you
thank you city council for having us speak today my name is Lieutenant Adriana Rivera i'm an EMT and training
officer i also work for an organization called Emergency Medical Service Public Advocacy Council EMS PAC that strives
for the ideal of pay parity and proper mental health support for EMTs i'm also the mother of a 10-year-old EMT junior
who I'm very proud of um I am the chief of the EMS PAC's peer mentor support
hardship help division open to all members of service whether private or volunteer alike i come here today to
speak on behalf of EMS workers in the service over the last few years emergency call volume has increased
tremendously emts are expected to perform at their very best every second of their shift these individuals are
exposed to the worst of what the city has to offer but are the best people in our city they deal with mass casualty
incidents severe domestic violence situations child abuse miscarriages gunshot and stab victims grandparents
dead on arrival overdoses are expected murder and suicides are typical dead
baby today rape victim tomorrow this is their norm i apologize if this sounds blunt to you but I only describe what it
takes to be an emergency medical service worker out in the field they arrive to the same calls that police do without
proper med uh safety equipment willing to put themselves at risk they are assaulted spit on and degraded this is
their daily grind upward 40 hours a week day in day out they do this all on minimal pay over the last 20 years the
starting pay has only increased by $4.69 for the fire department EMT workers this is certainly not a living
wage uh these people have families to support and they're trying to pay their way through school the percentage of
call volume has increased astronomically over the past few years while the pay has certainly lagged behind the rate of
suicide among first responders has seen an uptick certainly increasing during the pan pandemic and hasn't slowed since
there's an unfortunate stigma to seeking mental health help members are afraid that they will be put on restricted
duties or feel ostracized from their cohorts i hope that you take into consideration my testimony and the
testimony of my pre my peers i pray that the city council votes yes to increase wages which will encourage neighboring
EMS services to fall in line and yes to funding mental health resources for EMS workers thank you for your time
thank you great job great job
first off I want to say uh good afternoon to everybody in this room room i hope everybody has a good day and I also want to just give thanks to God and
thank thanks to Jesus Christ uh I want to thank you guys for hearing my testimony and my comrade my name is
David Cook i'm a lieutenant with the fire department New York City EMS i worked 17 years with the fire department
and to be honest with you I really deserve more than two minutes because I put my life on the line saving every person in New York City every burrow
non-stop doing countless countless hours of overtime you see I'm a paramedic and I'm also a former paramedic instructor
which means I trained a lot of young EMTs and paramedics to do great field work in the streets you see Michael
Fineran was one of my instructors and he called he called me when I was a young EMT 21-year-old kid on the job superhero
and I I learned very quickly that every superhero and I'm going to use Superman as the uh analogy that even Superman
deserves to go home to Lois Lane and um can be Clark Clint Clark Kent and
live live his life normal and that goes for every man and women in the fire department EMS the pay is so low
everybody's doing countless overtime you have mothers struggling by themselves they're struggling by themselves taking
care of one two three four five kids we need you guys to vote on money listen how do you want the superheroes to save
the firemen the police officers when they go in dangerous buildings who's who you think's going to save them the paramedics and EMTs i'm speaking for
everybody i'm also vice president of operations of a nonprofit organization called EMS Pack we have about 12,000
followers and we educate the public and all we promote is pay parody so yeah we need everybody to stop saying you're
going to do something actually do something i testified here in 2020 right here that says New York's
best when I got this jacket done it says New York best that's that's what FDNY
EMS is so I want to figure out why we got to sit here and negotiate and waste time on when to pay us let's cut let's
cut the nonsense and Mayor Adams made promises he didn't live up to it a lot of these politicians been in office
didn't live up to it so I'm tired of the games and the truth is all of the EMTs and paramedics are struggling you have
men suffering through mental health they're paying child support they're struggling to take care of their kids i'm going to keep going i deserve that i
earned that i sit there and intubate patients when they go into cardiac arrest i stick IVs in patients arms and
give them medication i I bring the dead back to life in New York City you're going to hear me when I
talk that's a fact i speak for all the EMTs and paramedics you're going to respect me that's a
fact i got the internal affairs in the fire department chasing EMTs and paramedics out of bathrooms and taking
their money for nonsense and FDNY EMS fdny EMS dictates when the privates
and hospital 911 are going to get their salary increased so if you don't increase the EMTs and paramedic salary in the fire department the rest of them
got to suffer so who's going to have the kahunas to do what they got to do i got to keep coming back
here my name's David Jesse Cook thank
you thank you
thank you all for Thank you all thank Thanks to all of you for your testimony
today and sharing your thoughts and experience if there's anyone in the chamber who wishes to speak but has not
yet had the opportunity to do so please raise your hand and fill out an appearance card with the
sergeant-at-arms at the back of the room seeing no hands in the chamber we will
now shift to online testimony via
Zoom we will now call Johnny Gileiam you
may begin
hi i'm sorry can you folks hear me okay yes great um good afternoon Chair Salam
and the members of the committee on public safety my name is Johnny Gillum i am a um parallegal at the New York City
Antiolence Project AVP you heard from my colleague earlier so I will try to just speak from the legal perspective um and
avoid duplication my written testimony does go into considerably more detail than I'll be able to here and I
encourage all of you to read it now you folks don't need me to tell you that the LGBTQ community that we serve which
includes immigrants black and brown folks sex workers and queer New Yorkers of all descriptions is under direct
legal attack from the federal government um small community organizations like ours are likewise targeted we at AP have
been defunded nearly half a million dollars in federal grants um and we expect to lose considerably more that's
a lot of money for a small organization like ours um we don't know if we're going to be able to survive in a budgetary perspective and so for this
reason we ask that the council increase funding to vulnerable legal organizations like our own um and also encourage mock to do the same we at AP
Legal represent clients at all levels of the criminal justice system our clients are often undocumented or sex workers or
both and they tend to move between the traditional roles of victim and perpetrator within the criminal justice system we strive to provide those
clients with holistic and culturally competent representation that other folks would not be able to we do crime
victims advocacy criminal defendant advocacy immigration representation etc to give you an example I want to briefly
introduce Isabella who is a client of ours she's a trans woman from Guatemala a victim of trafficking um she is now
subject to the racist and unconstitutional lake and Riley Act so if she were picked up by ICE today she
would be sumearily deported without um any right to representation when we first started working with her we were
doing defense advocacy um then we moved into deportation defense and we're now doing crime victims advocacy for her
trying to get her out of her trafficking situation um and we're working with city agencies to do that and that's just kind
of a brief example of the really holistic um representation that we're able to provide thank you for your
testimony time has expired thank you
thank you we are now making a final call for any person who is on Zoom who has
not yet spoken if you're currently on Zoom and wish to speak but have not yet had the opportunity to do so please use

everyone that makes the magic cap and behind the scenes to bring everything together for the past four years uh and
for the hearings today uh welcome Director Jiha and your team uh thanks
for being here today thank you for joining us to answer our questions but before I go any further I want to invite
our speaker Adrienne Adams to give her opening remarks
thank you Finance Chair good morning or good morning yeah good morning everyone
um thank you Finance Chair Brandon for holding today's executive budget hearing this is the last for
FY26 the mayor's executive budget for fiscal year 26 is
$115.1 billion it's an increase of half a billion dollars from the FY26
preliminary budget this week the council unveiled our latest economic and tax
forecast which shows consistent revenue projections that continue to outpace OMBs by 1.7 billion for fiscal years
2025 and 2026 our city's economy is resilient
despite the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's volatile economic and tariff policies that have undermined
US economic growth prior to the tariffs and trade policy turmoil the national
economy was expected to grow at a healthy rate of around 2.1% this year
now due to Trump's policies the council expects economic growth to fall one to
1.3% in 2025 during this period of chaos from the federal government the council's
focus is on advancing investments that help make our city safer and more affordable new Yorkers count on our city
budget to prioritize their needs and make it possible for them to build their lives in our great city while the
executive budget includes some key investments that the council has long called for and were included in our
preliminary budget response there remains work to do to ensure that the adopted budget includes vital funding
for programs missing in the mayor's executive budget new Yorkers from our
youngest to our seniors depend on cultural institutions libraries and
parks to maintain meaningful connections to each other their cultures and their
communities our parks are a lifeline for our city annually they receive over 100
million visits and yet compared to other major American cities New York City
allocates a significantly less proportion of its budget to our parks department we need to narrow that gap
and allocate more funding for key programs staffing and maintenance so that our parks can remain clean and safe
for all to enjoy and our seniors who are the crown jewels of our communities
deserve further support we would not be here without them and yet so many are struggling to age in place and still
experience food insecurity we can address this by expanding access to home
delivered meals and upgrading older adult centers that provide essential services to advance public safety the
mayoral administration must adequately invest in the programs proven to make our communities safer following through
on the city's commitment to close Rikers as a part of improving public safety we must invest at the scale needed in
mental health and community-based safety programs that are proven to reduce recidivism help crime victims recover
and stop cycles of violence while some funding has been added into the executive budget our investments are
still incomplete the city budget must commit additional funding for residential treatment beds for people
with mental health challenges justice involves supportive housing and other criminal other critical
interventions we must also support working families by fully investing in our public schools child care vouchers
and early childhood education programs like 3K and preK ensuring the stability
of the state's child care assistance program vouchers is critical to protecting families access to affordable
child care we need to move forward towards expanding access to all families
not simply protecting what currently exists which we know leaves too many without support cuni NICHA and housing
investments also need to be prioritized in the final budget finally community- based organizations
and nonprofits serving on the front lines of our communities rely on council funding to deliver for New Yorkers we
need to ensure the city keeps its commitment to them and to the communities that they serve director
Jihi hoped to hear from you today about the steps OM is taking to address these outstanding issues in this budget we've
spent the past days of budget hearings listening to agency officials and New Yorkers about the immense needs in our
city and it's critical that the city delivers for them thank you very much and now I turn it back over to Chair
Brent thank you speaker uh as you mentioned yesterday the council released
our economic and tax forecast for the FY26 budget and the findings from our
updated analysis remain consistent with what the council has been arguing through the budget process new York
City's economy continues to show resilience with higher tax revenues than projected by OM over FY25 and
26 even though our economic growth lags below our long run average the council's
tax revenue forecast remains largely the same as our previous forecast this past February with shifts in the timing of
revenues we project that the city will collect a total of $1.7 billion more in
tax revenue in the current and next fiscal years than OMB projects in their May plan it's driven largely by stronger
collections in property tax personal income tax and unincorporated business taxes additionally we project $2.5
billion greater tax revenue collection in FY27 3.2 billion in FY28 and 3.9 billion
in FY29 the council sees tax revenue to grow at an average of 4.5% annually
through the forecast period while trending the right way remains below the
5 a.5% annual growth the city saw in the prior decade while the council does not
project a dream economic environment that's no rationale for aggressive cuts and failing to make use of every
resource we have on hand we have what we need to preserve neighborhood cornerstones like our parks libraries
and cultural institutions as well as to protect essential services like housing
mental health care and early childhood education that keeps New Yorkers on their feet the more we put and the more
we invest into New Yorkers the more New York City will get back i'll have questions today uh focused largely on
the unincorporated business tax sales tax reserves uh city agency headcount
the capital budget and several issues that came up in our prior hearings uh just as a reminder for everyone uh who's
with us today uh only written testimony will be admitted for today's hearing so if you wish to submit written testimony
for the record you may email it to testimony@counsel.nyc.gov gov anytime up to 72 hours after the
conclusion of today's hearing audio and video recordings will not be admitted but transcripts of such recordings can

can get started good morning do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but
the truth before this committee and to respond honestly to council member questions director
Jihop first Deputy Godner i do um Deputy Director Boyard i do and
Deputy Director McKenna i do thank you you may begin
thank you you may begin sit the mic
good morning Speaker Adams Chair Brennan and members of the Finance Committee and City Council
thank you for the opportunity to testify here today about the fiscal year 2026
executive budget i'm Jacquesha and I'm the director of the
New York City Mayor's Office of Management and Budget i'm joined by OM
First Deputy Director Ken Gardner and senior deputy directors Tabard and
Latana McKini the fiscal year 2026 executive budget is balanced at $115.1
billion with u manageable outyear gaps of $4.6 billion $5.8 billion and $5.7
billion in fiscal year uh 27 through 29 our budget res our budget reserves
remain at a record level of $8.5 billion
four fundamental elements shape the executive budget a strong economy
significant savings sound and targeted investments and fiscal
discipline first the economy like you said remains resilient as a result the
labor market is strong with employment at an all-time high and unemployment
declining across all demographics notably unemployment among black and
Hispanic New Yorkers has dropped by more than two percentage points since this
administration took office the city population is also rebounding from the pandemic era dip and
tourism has returned to near record levels additionally Wall Street posted a
near record performance in 2024 this strong economic growth led to an
upward revision in tax revenue forecast over the fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget of $1.7 billion in fiscal year 25
and $1 billion in fiscal year 26 this represent growth of about 8% in
fiscal year 2025 but tax revenue is projected to grow by about 1% next fiscal year as the
economy is anticipated to slow achieving savings is a key
administration priority total savings in this plan are $1.9 billion over fiscal
year 25 and 26 and were attained without service cuts or layoffs
this includes asylum seeker savings of 298 million $298 million in fiscal year
25 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 26 to reflect the census
decline this brings the two-year savings total from all sources over the last
three plan to nearly $6.8 8
billion as a program we're able to make critical
upstreams investment and reduce risks in the financial plan by baselining funding
for many recurring programs that have been funded with short-term stimulus dollars or one year at a time
and despite our good fortune we remain fiscally disciplined we invested
prudently city funded expenditure within the fiscal year 2026 executive budget
grew just 1.3% over the preliminary budget and it is
2.2% or $2 billion lower than it was at last year's executive budget
we added nearly $900 million to protect critical services for the most
vulnerable uh members of our community in the current fiscal year this includes the
city Medicaid contribution City Feb's rental assistance cash assistance HIV AIDS
housing services and housing vouchers and social services for seniors and more
we took steps to support human services providers and nonprofits that partner
with the city to deliver essential services to the community by funding and
direct uh rate growth for New York City aging the New York City public schools
and our human resources administration and making cost of living adjustments
for criminal justice providers we also invested 1.4 4 billion
in public safety cleanliness affordability education and child care in fiscal year 26 and more than
$675 million is baseline it is important to highlight
that many of these investments are supported by members of this council
there is no end to what we can achieve together for our communities for our
city and for our future to safeguard the constitutional right to council we strengthened support
for indigent defense providers we also funded criminal justice initiatives
including alternatives to incarceration and enhanced supervision and to promote
successful re-entry we are helping decarcerated individuals secure housing
employment mentorship and healthcare and we added support for tra
trauma trauma recovery centers which provide safe spaces and treatment
through super surviv survivors of violent crime who have less access to
traditional victim services we have also increased staffing at the
civilian complaint review board further we fun the funding
in by the fall of 2026 in this plan we are also deepening
the mayor's commitment to his get stuff clean and trash evolution initiatives by
baselineing support for little basket pickup throughout the city spaces that
were frequently overlooked historically not wellkept and trash pick up on the pay meter of parks and greenways
this is on top of the investment we made in the preliminary budget to expand the parks department second shift bringing
resources to 100 new hotspots in 65 64 parks across the five
BS in this plan we have added over $und00 million dollar annually to
backfill expired stimulus dollars and restore savings to New York City aging
this funding will help ensure dignity and quality of life for older New Yorkers through home deliver meals older
adult centers and more and to fight food insecurity we have included funding for
over 700 food pantries across the city through the community food connection
program and the popular groceries to go program and because cost should not be a
barrier to getting to work school or to the doctors we will maintain funding for
fairs and once again summer youth employment participants will receive
free metro cards we restored nearly $und00 million in funding for CUNI and
maintain support for the ACE and the ASAP programs and the Brooklyn recol
further we added $45 million in annual support for the New York City Department
of Cultural Affairs Cultural Development Fund and Cultural Institution Group this
is the first time in 20 years that this funding has been baseline we also added
more than $15 million towards the public library budget branch budget next fiscal
year now there is annual funding for nearly $200 million for education
programs that have been supported with short-term stimulus to ensure the
continuity of these critical programs we baseline resources for 3K arts education
teachers equipment project pivot computer science education
and and we have also baseline support for over 700 early childhood education
seats for three and four years old in special education prek further the mayor has has expanded
the after school for all program which will strengthen and scale the program to
achieve the mayor's vision of making the program universal this includes adding
seats for 220,000 K5 students by the fall of
2027 this is a baseline investment that goes to $330 million over the financial
plan and in two fiscal years the city will work with community groups to
conduct a needs assessment and gather input on further slat
expansion though there's much more to say on education and child care I will also highlight three other priorities we
committed baseline funding for school nurses new teachers to meet class- size
targets and we are funding Promise New York in NYC in the year ahead
because reading writing communication skills are crucial to social and economic mobility we are investing in
adult literacy programming although we have made a robust investment and baseline many many
initiatives for the first time we must acknowledge the significant challenge
challenges and risks that remain ahead we are still caring for more than
38,000 is asylum seekers on our own at a monthly cost of approximately $200
million with total estimated cost since July 2022 totaling $7.7
billion in the preliminary budget we had assumed that the state will provide $1
billion in resources in its fiscal year 26 budget to cover migrant
expenses because we had to release the executive budget before state budget adoption and it was apparent at the time
that the state would not meet this need we backfilled this budget hole with city
resources we also reflected cost shift of $166 million annually related to MTA
par transit obligations and after 4 p.m school
busing to our disappointment the adopted state budget
shifted far more cost to the city than we had anticipated
this includes an $275 million annual increase in the city's contribution for
child care vouchers which has grown to $328
million altogether the state budget will cost city taxpayers an additional $550
million annually bringing the total state budget impact to about $1.7
billion we also face risks related to funding
cuts at the federal level and changes to grant requirements in addition the trade
policy announced in early April and the subsequent impact on financial markets
pose a potential threat threat to the city's economy as well as its tax base
the federal administration is reviewing grants to ensure that they comply with the president recent executive orders
and has terminated funding for some entities additionally several federal
agencies have added grant certification requirements designed to force
conformity with revised immigration and diversity equity and inclusion policies
our office in coordin in coordination with the law department is closely
monitoring grant cancellations and new grant requirement and the city's actively engage in litigation where
appropriate often in conjunction with other localities but at the end of the day we
may have to make very difficult decisions about the extent of our ongoing reliance on federal funding to
support critical city services some may be tempted to apply budget
reserves but these funds would only provide temporary
support once these reserves are used they are gone the reality is that no
municipality has the resources to backfill federal funding put simply we
have some serious challenges ahead of us as we get closer to budget adoption I
look forward to working with the council to protect the city's interest in Albany and Washington and to identify resources
to fund our many joint priorities to support our recovery promote public
health and safety expand opportunity and improves and improve the lives of
everyday New Yorkers thank you and I look forward to your questions
thank you very much uh we've been joined by council members Hank Salam Riley and
and uh Majority Leader Fius and now I'm going to turn to Speaker Adams for her
questions thank you Chair and welcome it's good to see you
all the administration's two for one hiring policy has been in effect for more than a year
in that time I have heard numerous commissioners blaming staffing levels and hiring issues for issues their
agencies have with provision of critical services the city's current actual
full-time headcount is slightly over 286,000 which is more than 5% less than
the headcount of just before the COVID pandemic in that same period the city's budgeted full-time headcount declined by
only 1.9% vacancies continue to be an issue
citywide so my questions on this issue are is the two for one hiring freeze
still in effect what positions are currently exempted from the hiring freeze and are there any plans to end
the hiring freeze in the near future especially given the issues agencies have providing services
yeah um as you can imagine the high um embedded in our budget is savings
from uh the 241 and uh and as you can imagine we are
dealing with some serious challenges ahead of us so therefore the policy remains in place however we have
exempted okay a number of positions from the 241 including uniform personnel
inspectors and revenue generating positions any position dealing with public health public safety and revenue
generation we have exempted those positions and some critical position for instance in cash assistance uh program
so we have exempted many of these uh uh positions we are working with agencies
to assess their needs on a day on a day-to-day basis and when there is a
severe problem that we believe needs to be addressed we we usually try to make an exemption for those uh cases
so as far as the revenue generating positions are are concerned you are stopping there and everything else is on
an individual case basis what will be considered then um a revenue generating position uh revenue engineering pushment
would be an auditor no no I understand that part i I mean as far as going on a case-byase basis your
determination then as far as hearing from your agencies would determine what
is revenue generating we we have revenue generating positions we also have as I
said uniform public safety public health and when based on our discussion with the agencies if uh they have a need that
is pressing we usually tend to address those needs okay so there are no plans
uh to lift the hiring freeze in the near future you're just going to go on an individual case basis going forward not
at this moment but as you know we have made significant significant progress in term of the vacancy in New York City i
mean uh last in June of 2023 it was at 7 and a half% now we are down to like 5.9%
so we we're making progress okay all right let's talk a little bit about NYPD headcount in order to get a
handle on the rampant usage of overtime the commissioner stated that one of her strategies was to have as many uniformed
officers on the streets the NYPD's budgeted uniform headcount is
currently 35,000 with over 1300 vacancies there are also over 1,600
civilian vacancies including key titles like 911 operators what is the plan to
fill these vacancies and what role has OM played in helping the NYPD fill vacancies to be fully staffed to its
budgeted headcount we currently are working with uh the uh NYPD to make sure
that uh they got all the resources that they need we give them approval i believe to have had 3,500
uh officers this year um and um same thing with the 911 operators um because
they are exempt from their hiring fees so it's just a question of um you know and we've been approving you know all
the requests that they uh they have sent us so far
okay thank you in in looking at the child care voucher funding shortfall and
the state budget which you um alluded to in your opening statement at the
preliminary budget hearing ACS indicated that the city was projecting a shortfall in state and federal funding to support
the city's child care voucher program through the upcoming federal fiscal year
which is October 1st 2025 through September 30th 2026 because the state enacted its
budget after the release of your executive plan it didn't address the child care voucher funding gap but now
we know that the enacted state budget includes an additional $350 million
appropriation that the city can access to cover the cost of child care vouchers
based on the language in the enacted state budget how much is the city required to contribute to access the
full additional $350 million of state funds um it is uh $328 million which is
uh what uh the MOE is uh is uh is asking for uh but again we will continue to
work with ACS to assess the program to assess the need of the program and see uh where we going to end at the end of
the day because it's still waiting for guidance from the state okay to assess uh uh those funds and uh I believe
recently uh the state uh approved uh the uh the continuity of care program which
prioritize our low-inccome population for low-inccome vouchers so again we're
working with them but bas basically what the minimum we need to put in is about $328 million okay thank you at the
preliminary budget hearing with ACS the commissioner indicated the agency projected its child care voucher
expenditures for fiscal year 2026 at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion is
that still the projected cost and can you please explain to me the calculations for how this cost was
derived and why the range is so broad it's it's again it's based on certain
assumptions uh that uh that are made and again as I said I would defer to uh um
ACS uh to provide you more explanation but based on our own uh calculation we
believe that uh um you know we
um we will provide we'll get the resources that we need to make sure that the needs are met by the public but the
mayor made the decision that this is such a critical program that we have to fund this program to
make sure that the needs of the parents are met so again we will continue to
work with ACS to assess uh how much is needed as I said and based on the
guidance that would be provided to them by the state and we'll make an assessment in the future of what the needs are
so you agree with the commissioner that the uh projection is still 1.5 billion
and between two 1.5 and 2 billion again as I said it's so many uh moving
parts again these forecasts are based on assumptions you know
and you know any change in the assumptions could change the numbers so what we commit to the mayors make the
commitment that this is so critical for parents that we will be working with ACS
to make sure that if there is a need we will begin we will address those need as
we go throughout the year okay along those same lines at the preliminary
budget hearing with ACS the commissioner indicated they weren't processing new applicants and putting children on
waiting lists at the executive budget hearing um sorry the commissioner said
the agency was working with OM to include more money so families currently receiving a voucher would keep them what
is the plan and does the administration still intend to put families on weight lists what plans does the administration
have to eliminate weight lists and how much money does it project this to cost
yeah we uh we put we have a wait list and as I said uh you know as we go
forward we continue to assess the program because at this moment in time we can't tell you fully you know what's
going to be needed to take care of the waiting list again because so many assumptions you know in terms of how
many people were going to be um was going to return to you know in term of people on cash assistance what's going
to be the uptake so we don't know a lot of pieces so we're doing an assessment As I said there's a commitment on the
part of the administration to make sure that parents have the resources that they need so we're just going to
continue to work with that what are the needs and also
work with the state is is there a plan though it doesn't sound like there is is there a plan to actually eliminate the
weight list or is this just indefinitely no there's there they working on a plan
to you know get rid of weight list to begin with we have to make sure we cap the program to get a full grasp of
what's going on to begin with okay and once we have a grasp of what's going on then we'll make a decision in terms of
how we're going to proceed going forward okay last year we fought to continue to
provide principles with adequate funding so that their budgets wouldn't decrease drastically from year to year will the
administration work with the council to initially hold schools harmless for any enrollment declines in the 2025 2026
school year as you did last year at adoption we will work we'll continue to work with the council and uh and we
discuss discuss this as part of budget adoption is that a commitment uh we will work with with the council
okay let's talk a little bit about the state budget and housing the state enacted budget includes over $1 billion
in additional capital funding for housing development construction and preservation that was secured as part of
our city of Yes and City for all agreement the state budget gives broad categories for which funding can be used
based on the agreement and requires the city to seek approval for spending plans from the state budget director what kind
of input is OM going to have in the process and how is it approaching this
um these are state fund and OM you know technically we are not you know uh the
entity that's responsible to submit the plan uh we will make a plan with NICHA
for how to use this fund and NICHA would work with the state directly for
approval in a timely manner and those fund that are expected to support HPD project will forward
directly to those projects while we plan to remain in close contact with the state about uh those
allocations to the state for approval in a time timely and efficient way it t you
want to take this on hello hi uh we won't be submitting the plans that'll be done largely by the
housing authority as well as HPD but we'll be working in coordination with them okay we will work with them but
we're not directly submitting those plans it's NICHA and HPD okay got it
let's look a little at um potential federal cuts right now the fiscal 2026
budget includes over $7.4 billion of federal funds allocated across many city
agencies but we're all well aware that there's a very real chance that come November this estimate may need to be
decreased what safeguards do you have in place to make sure that critical city services are not interrupted if this
happens madam Speaker um we will fight for every federal
dollar that New Yorkers deserve um New Yorkers pay their
fair and should not be penalized simply
because the cities is following state and local laws
so we will continue to fight as hard as we can okay to make sure that we get
every doubt that we deserve now if for whatever reason
we we lose some ch you know some of our legal challenges we will basically we have a
decision matrix that we go in house we review we assess every single one of
these programs and uh if the program is deemed to be very critical we will come back to
the mayor and the council with recommendations in term of what to backfill but not to backill it but what
we said before and we'll continue to maintain the same uh um uh posture is
given the scope the size of you know the amount of money that that is involved no
municipality has the resources to backfill federal funding understood okay
so we have city is not the only uh place in this
country that is at jeopardy right now yes for federal funding loss what what I'd like to hear though
is that will OM work with work with the city council to create a plan of course
we as a have is we don't want to send signal
okay to uh DC that it's okay to cut
funding with impunity because hey we we know every case that we're making is
they causing harm to the city okay so you don't want to create a plan that says hey I have resources to backfill
all of these things so in that case there's no harm understood okay So therefore we don't want to telegraph
okay all the steps all the measures that we plan on taking but uh we will
definitely work with the council because this is our job to basically to face that challenge together because in the
extreme case it would be very challenging for the city to deal with this thing i agree thousand% um and
thank you for agreeing to work collaboratively with us to create a plan if needed let's talk a little bit about
homeless shelter costs in the current year the city has budgeted over $2.6 billion for the cost of housing the
non-assylum seeker homeless population this year's budget has increased by over
$760 million since adoption alone the city plans to spend more to shelter the
homeless this year than the entire fiscal 2026 budgets of all but five city
agencies year after year we spend more and more to house the homeless is paying
the costs of the homeless shelter system the most coste effective strategy to
combat and respond to homelessness um it is
um put it this way we have to tackle these things it's like not one at the
expense of the other okay uh we need shelter to deal with the short-term stay
short-term challenges that we're dealing with somebody who wants you know overnight stay so you're going to need
to have a shelter program for that group of people but at the same time we also need long long-term housing okay to deal
with the long-term problem which is the shortage of housing that we have in the city so we have to tackle it on both
angle you know but you know uh uh we have to look at it from uh these two perspective we need both shelter and
housing it's not one at the expense of the other what other approaches is the city taking
to reduce shelter costs and move people from homelessness to permanent housing
we've one of the most effective tool we have has been the uh CDF's voucher as
you can see the program has grown exponentially in the last uh five years
it's a program that started with about $300 million it's not about $1.2 billion you know so it's because you
know we basically are issuing a lot of vouchers to folks to get them out of the
shadow system which this council has advocated for time and time again
yes we understand but thank you for those gold stars how much is included in the budget for
programs that would move the homeless into permanent housing we again as I said we have uh resources
added to the budget for we have resources in the budget for um city feeps this is one of uh as I said one of
the most effective tools that we have and we'll continue to assess different
policies do you have a figure i'm sorry do you have a figure how much uh how
much you currently have city febs right now i believe for fiscal year 25 we're
projecting we're going to spend about like $1.3 billion uh for city fabs and
um we added $325 million in the preliminary budget and for uh
2026 we'll begin to address uh you know uh some of the needs as uh we move
throughout uh the fiscal year
okay all right let's talk about uh public safety investments to close Rikers and mental health the Independent
Rikers Commission released its blueprint to close Rikers identifying a number of key investments the city must take into
mental health and public safety programs that are not only critical to closing Rikers but also addressing the city's
mental health crisis and improving public safety the executive budget added some important funding for mental health
programs and recidivism reduction programs but there are still remaining gaps to ensure these programs actually
have the capacity to fulfill the needs New Yorkers have for them for example justice involves supportive housing
supervised released intensive case management re-entry programs mobile
treatment teams and mental health residential treatment beds are all underfunded or unfunded in the budget
many of these programs can be cost-effective by saving the city the higher expenses of unnecessarily placing
people who could be helped with treatment into jails that cost more and don't solve their underlying issues
while increasing the likelihood that they will repeatedly return to jail and
cost the city in various other ways seems like a vicious circle to me how
does OM analyze the cost effectiveness of prevention programs and is there any assessment made that it would be wiser
for the city to invest more in effective mental health and prevention programs so they actually reach people reducing the
accompanying costs when they're inaccessibility leads to other bad outcomes essentially this is the concept
that prevention is more coste effective than an emergency room response
we wholly agree with you and that's the reason why in the executive budget we made so many investment in uh trying to
reduce uh uh the uh jail population um you know as you know we funded uh uh an
extension of the intensive case management pilot in the executive budget with 9.1 uh million dollars we have
Joseph justice involve uh support housing uh there FP out there for up to
500 we have uh uh mobile uh treatment funded in the exec for like $45
million we uh baseline um funding for project reset and rapid reset we
baseline funding uh in for $7.6 6 million for alternative to incarceration
services we baseline $4.7 million to help stabilize recently decarcerated
individual with re-entry planning services we you know so we we made a
bunch of uh $9.1 million in intensive case management pilot to provide
enhanced supervision for,00 defendants so again we fully agree with you that
many of these programs you know this program are effective and that's the reason why we made so much investment in
you know in the uh executive budget on these programs thank you um we're we want to take a
look at expanding that a bit the recently enacted state budget included up
toing agreement for the for the council's city for all housing plan is
the administration planning to use any of these funds to open the 380 additional
units of justice involved supported housing promised in the 2019 points of agreement on closing Rikers and also
recently recommended by the independent Riker's commission t you want to take that
okay we'll get back to you on question on this on this topic because we will work with the state and apply for all
the funds but we'll get back to you okay that specific answer that's pretty critical because that works with
everything that we're all trying to do sure with this subject matter okay thank you Mr chair thank you for your time
thank you ma'am thank you speaker um I want to jump into the credit rating so
Moody's uh downgraded uh US credit rating from AAA negative to double A1
stable on May 16th I believe uh reflecting accelerated deficit growth
and associated borrowing requirements a
fiscal OM anticipate any indirect effects of the US credit downgrade on
our bonds here in the city put it this way we do not anticipate a
direct impact on city bonds however there may be some indirect impact in the
sense that to the extent that
but we do not anticipate a direct impact okay on city bonds
and each of the three major rating agencies expressed concern about the city's long-term liabilities
includilities for retirees how seriously is the city taking the issue of
long-term liabilities including but not limited to pensions
um we have some while we have considerable uh uh long-term
liabilities we have to also remember that we are managing those liability within uh um uh our ability to
meet those obligations the coverage that we have is more than enough to be quite
honest with you to uh support those debt for instance um the um city uh total
debt outstanding okay has gone substantially slower than our own personal income or
the value of taxable properties okay which is what you usually use over the
last 10 years meaning that the city can now afford uh uh to his debt to carries that today
okay better than he was 10 years ago so we have the debt coverage you know
personal income is growing faster than the pace at which we uh uh issue debt um
our pension another good example was funded at 81% back in 2022 now we at 86%
and uh we continue to make the uh actual required required contribution which
would be means that uh we would be uh 100% funded if all the assumptions are
met so we feel comfortable with the way we have managed our long-term debt so we
have enough coverage for those uh debts so therefore it's not a major issue for us
okay um I'm talking about taxable bonds so while all city debt is issued to
finance projects with a public purpose some capital projects are not eligible uh to utilize federal tax exempt bonds
um could you tell us what sort of projects are not eligible to be financed by taxexempt bonds uh pursuant to
federal uh uh tax rule project that have both private
use and actual or deemed private payments to the city uh may not be
financed with tax exemp uh bonds um this category includes uh affordable housing
loans and many economic development projects so what we do is we review all capital
project to ensure that they are properly designated as eligible for tax exempt or
taxable bonds and what's the average what what's the average spread between the interest rates on the city's tax
exempt and taxable bonds it's about one and a half to 2% and I believe on a 10
year maturity last two years was about 1.9% percentage point
okay um talk about reserves uh Standard and Poor's most recent rating of the
city's general obligation bonds notes that the city has large financial reserves of almost 11.4 billion at fis
at uh the end of fiscal year 24 uh S&P looks at both the city's reserve
accounts and surplus budget roles at the end of the fiscal year when evaluating uh how they come up with our reserves
what level of financial reserves as measured by S&P does OM think we'll have
at the end of FY25 um at this point in time we know we have
uh the um the total reserve is about $8.5 billion and I think with in the
executive budget right now we have prepayments of about $3 billion total i
mean including the 600 million so you're talking right now at 11 and a half
so it'll be about the same as the end of FY24 we're probably going to end up probably same probably the same place
okay okay
um and besides being a way to protect city services during a downturn reserves can also help us lower the effective
cost of our capital projects um how much additional deposits into the reserves do
you think would be necessary to uh uh affectuate a ratings
increase uh I to be quite honest with you I think the the level of reserve that we have right now is uh adequate
and I'm I said it over and over because we believe uh we also need some
flexibility in term of the way we manage uh our finances so reserve by itself is
not in itself is not it's one of those factors but by itself it's not going to
trigger uh uh um a rating increase so from my perspective is you have to look
at on top you know the way we manage our debt the way we manage city finances
uh you have to look at the economy it's a it's a number of factors that play into uh uh an increase in uh in the um
in our rating so therefore just you know just the reserve by itself from our perspective is not you know in itself
you know enough to trigger but again as far as we're concerned we believe the
the level of res that reserve that we have right now is appropriate is adequate uh for uh to uh to deal with a
potential downturn in the economy and how much does the typical increase in the city's bond rating save the city in
lower debt service costs it is about like uh 5 to 10 basis
points so if you show issuing let's say $10 billion worth of debt you're talking
about five to$10 million
okay um the executive plan included uh $266 million in savings from writing off
prior year receivables and expenses this year uh this is after finding a similar
uh $500 million in savings in the preliminary plan making a total of over $800 million in savings this year in in
past years at most uh the city took 400 millions of savings from these
write-offs so c can you explain the process that OM goes through to determine these savings and how how do
you identify these savings and what's the and then how what's the process for writing them off yeah uh this one in the
executive budget was related to I believe it's an asylum seeker uh um
breakdown and this wasn't a cool that was put up in fiscal year 2023
uh you know and we were writing it down this year and is that why the savings for FY25 are so much higher than
previous years yes okay which agencies have the highest
amount of prior year revenues written off um I could give you that information
okay on top of it okay um I want to talk about uh CDPAP
the home healthcare employment has been rapidly expanding in the city as baby boomers reach uh their senior years uh
in April uh 293,000 New Yorkers were employed in this sector which was around
9 and a half% uh or about almost 30,000 jobs greater
than at the same point in the prior year new York State's consumerdirected uh personal assistance program CDPAP um
funded through Medicaid allows recipients to choose a home health care provider including relatives and friends
uh recently New York State has transformed the management of CDPAP from using many individual fiscal
intermediaries to only one statewide intermediary uh NYSPL to reduce costs
waste and fraud what are the anticipated implica implications of this structural
change uh to the city's home healthcare job growth uh like you said uh this is was uh one
of the drivers for us in term of uh uh employment gain um the state regulate
this program at this moment in time I cannot tell you exactly how this thing is going to play out but uh uh you know
our expectation is is probably going to lead some to some kind of uh decrease in the uh number of job in that
sector but at this moment in time I can't tell you for sure do you anticipate that that the cuts that uh
the president and Congress are supporting for Medicaid funding for states would exacerbate this this
employment area that could be okay um talking about the overall tax
revenue forecast uh FY25 tax revenues have been coming in a lot stronger than anyone expected including us and the
council in the executive plan OMB raised the FY tax revenue forecast by almost $1.7 billion more than half of that
increase was driven by a PIT the personal income tax up over 800 million it's a very big adjustment could you
tell us what caused you to increase the forecast so much uh as uh as I indicated
to you uh was at a near record level of profit in
2024 and so basically that uh basically drives bonus payments drives you know a
number of uh of our taxes to uh uh um to
come up higher than we initially anticipated and since you locked the forecast have
you seen any indications that it might uh cause you to revise it either way up or down
at this point in time no we don't anticipate to uh uh change our forecast dramatically
um because we believe we are on on target or slightly probably you know
close to what we projecting um we'll continue to access
uh uh uh the data tax revenue data as we get closer to the end of June because uh
June is a big month uh for these uh business taxes and we'll get a better
sense of uh where we will be but as you know the uh um final um um final rule
came out and I believe uh our forecast uh was overstated by about like $169
million or 130 by about $150 million so um so you
know I wouldn't be very aggressive in terms of property tax uh forecast for
next year based on the final because right now we looking at $169 million $59 million uh uh less than we had
anticipated in the um executive budget forecast the sales talking about sales
tax the executive plan includes a downward revision in the city sales tax forecast from the January plan um what
potential impacts does OMB assume the Trump administration's tariff chaos will
have on consumer prices in New York City i mean to the extent that u you know if
uh you know everybody's done with the forecast of uh the economy and if you
have a slowdown in the uh in the uh in the economy so we expect consumer to
spend less if consumer to spend less we expect sales tax to grow to decline as
well okay last question for me i want to turn over my colleagues uh in a crypto event
that the mayor attended in Las Vegas a couple days ago he announced that New York City will issue bit bonds has the
administration approached you about this idea we we just like we we review every
single you know we always trying to be at the frontier of technology new York is a leading uh city so therefore we
always work with different industry players to see what can be done uh right now we are in the ideation phase people
are talking bring ideas to the table to see what can be done what cannot be done good ideas bad ideas so that's where we
are there's nothing concrete at this moment in time but like everything else we in communication with we're in
constant you know communication with different industry leaders to see what because we always try to bring new
investors into the mix for New York City but there's nothing concrete did you know the mayor was going to announce
this great idea um I don't think he announc he's saying they're working on ideas we're not saying he's not saying
he didn't say that they're going to launch uh Bitcoin they you know we we're
working on the with the industry i mean he said he's I mean you know look the city bonds have a reputation of
stability and rel reliability i think everyone agrees that bitcoins and crypto that whole asset class is renowned for
chaos and scams and volatility um we barely have 20 years of historical data
on bitcoins and crypto why is the mayor suggesting that the city would invest in
crypto listen we exploring ideas we are not uh Do you think it's a good idea
listen I I can't tell you anything that is good or bad until we know for sure we
we in a process of exploring things this is something new okay we shouldn't be afraid of something because it's new
okay people used to rob bank i mean the city bonds city bonds have city bonds
have such a reputation for stability and reliability bitcoin is like the opposite of but it's just exploring there's
nothing wrong with exploring ideas you know there's nothing wrong with exploring ideas we shouldn't be afraid of exploring things all right i mean
listen to me this is I'm I'm fine going exploring but I think the safari should end immediately
all right Jo thank you um we've also been joined by council members Hudson Moya Dinowitz Joseph Stevens and Brewer
we will send it now to Majority Whip Brooks Powers for her questions thank
you chair and uh thank you for the testimony today uh I'm because I have a
lot to get through I'm going to just ask ask the questions you answer and I can repeat whatever so the first one is
focusing on the Department of Transportation and the streets plan in DOT's most recent streets plan report
which was released in March the department indicated that in 2024 it only built 13.5 miles of
protected bus lanes which once again is far short of the 30 miles required
annually dot is also required to install transit signal priority also known as
TSP at 1,000 intersections annually but completed only 766 this year
has DOT requested any additional staff to help the agency meet the streets plan
mandates if so how many additional positions and how much funding would be needed to support them what can we
expect that they will when can we expect that they will be added when it comes to
bus lanes DOT has consistently failed to meet the streets plan requirements and has fallen behind the aggregate 5-year
target how is the administration's prioritizing bus lane improvements and
what plans are in place to meet the required mandates for bus lanes why has
DOT been able to come closer to meeting the bike lane requirements but not the
targets for bus lanes and bus stops does OM feel that DOT has enough funding to
meet all streets plan mandates if not how much additional funding will be added and when if so why not i'm excuse
me why is DOT not able to meet the streets plan mandate also since the executive budget
has been published I want to understand what progress the administration has made in addressing um particularly two
main issues that I've consistently raised one is does the administration commit to expanding the fair
affairs program to cover New Yorkers earning up to 200% of the federal
poverty level also does the administration commit to funding the $300,000 needed
for the land transfer of the Far Rockaway Trauma Center site
and as a part of the city for all negotiations the administration committed to funding three projects in
council district 31 $119 million for Tidal Gates and Mott Basin 65 million
for a Laurelton Rodale cloud burst management system and $10 million for the Brookville Park Recreation Center
does the administration remain committed to these investments in the fiscal 26 budget and I can repeat any question you
need me to okay um with the regarding the street
plans um I would defer to uh DOT uh in term of the operations um but do you
feel like they have enough funding we've been exempting engineers for them mhm uh so that they could have uh the resources
that they need uh to uh work on those plans so but again I would defer to them
but have they come back to you for additional funding at all come back they keep they come back to us for asking for
uh exemption to our engineers which we have been working with them to provide them so you've been approving what
they've been requesting but they've been requesting okay uh fairs we uh 200%
level we basically as you know we funded fair 145 in the executive budget we uh
um will work with the council as we get closer to adoption to see what can be done if the resources are available uh
the land transfer uh this is something I would work with you and look into it to see what can be done there and what the
other one is again um it was the city for all negotiation
funding commitments um for three particular things in district 31 i wanted to just commit understand if the
administration remains committed we're committed to fund everything in the city yes okay um but uh for the uh detail you
know for the specific program I'm probably going to come back to you with uh the answers thank you thank you chair
okay we have questions from Deputy Speaker Ayala followed by Majority Leader Faras
good morning still morning um my questions are regarding uh the asylum
seeker response but before I get to those I did see and I heard in your testimony um conversations about the
uh expansion of the on the budget for sanitation and I just wanted to
reiterate something that I've been bringing up in some of the other uh sanitation hearings that there hasn't
really been you know um real equity in the budget the way
that I don't know i I haven't been able to determine how it is that sanitation
um decides how much funding each district gets but in the district that I
represent and that some of my colleagues sitting here represent um we haven't really seen a decrease in garbage in the
way that we would have hoped to when we increase like you know the um litter basket removals it seems like we need
more resources you know we we have higher density we have a lot of social service needs um there's just a lot of
unusual circumstances that um they require additional resources and
a study on on that right um because we would love to be able to say that our communities are you know uh clean and
thriving and you know road proof as well but that's not the case and is is not a criticism but more of an observation and
you know hoping that finally I can get down to you know to the root of this and figure out what exactly is the
determining factor in um trying to balance out the budget in a way that is
truly equitable because if we all get a slice of the pizza but you already had two slices before you know I got there
then it's not equitable um I would defer to um DSNY for uh geographic resource
allocation and I would also communicate your concern to the commissioner as well
and it's not that they're not cleaning because I see them cleaning they're doing what what they're being asked to
do it's just not so it's not them is not enough whatever it is that we're doing
it's really not enough in in those communities i will definitely have my folks uh reach out to your office
perfect i really appreciate that okay all right um so regarding the asylum seeker response um help center uh
significant savings from the asylum seeker response efforts have been included in both the preliminary and executive plans this includes 2.7
billion in state funding across fiscal years 26 uh to 29 that was reflected on
as savings in the executive plan the administration indicated that the savings are due to the declining asylum
seeker census and a decline in in new entrance uh leaving actual expenditures below what had been previously projected
according to a recent New York Times article um due to the lack of state funding the city will be closing the
asylum applications help center which has assisted more than 109,000 applications with asylum and work
authorization in addition to other legal matters uh do we know what what was spent on operating the asylum
application help center in fiscal year 24 and 25 um and what sources supported
the center what funding sources yeah the funding sources is coming from the state uh the actual spending I would provide
it I would you have it the actual well go ahead about about uh
49 million in FY25 and 24
around 40 so roughly the same there wasn't a lot there wasn't much change
roughly is that correct well it's 40 versus 49
So 40 41 okay no it's 40 in in 24 oh or 48 49 in 25 so Okay I heard it wrong
almost 20% higher great perfect um why is the city closing the asylum um
application help center because he was funded by the state you know and the funding dries up all right aren't there
still considerable number of people in the city that are that are requiring um this type of assistance and what is the
city's transition plan to continue to address this need after the center is closed we believe Moya would uh uh
continue to provide uh uh asylum seeker services particular legal services
u many of them with ghetto services to moya do they have additional funding resources we funded Moya we had about
like $42 million okay in fiscal year 26
okay um the governor's office obviously has indicated that the state has already
allocated 4.3 billion over the past two years for the city's asylum seeker response efforts one of the reasons that
she cites for not allocating additional funding is that the city has only drawn down 1.6 billion of the funds that were
allocated can you tell us how much of the 4.3 billion from the state has uh the city spent to date and how much has
been submitted for reimbursement okay the uh as I said this is an excuse
uh to be quite honest with you because uh the um the first billion dollars that the
state for us it was so cumbersome to uh basically get uh for us to put the
claims in because don't forget they only funded one/ird so therefore for that $1 billion we had to put in that $3 billion
of paid invoices okay okay so it takes time okay to get $3 billion for you to
get a billion dollars we could claim so it was process was so bad that they still changed it when they the following
year and they start giving us uh uh advances um so um we I believe how much
we have claimed so far uh we had they advanced us about 1.25 billion
uh to date of the 2.06 uh 06 uh billion
dollars and uh for the fundings that was committed uh by New York State for the
Randles Fy Bennett Field and Quidmmore uh we're in the process of submitting claims and awaiting approval from New
York State on the execution of contract and claiming plans that we submitted to
the state so it is uh as I said it's a purely excuse it's a process because you know
and it's not $4.3 billion that was given directly to the city i believe it's about like $2.6 billion that was given
to a city directly everything else was for other costs that the state uh uh uh
was paying for other things that uh in ter of their own so the delays been is is due to a cumbersome process
cumbersome process you know requirements that they have and it was so bad that
they even changed the entire process the second time around when they reappropriate money for us the uh the
following year so are we on track to receive the the the remaining portion we we we getting we're getting we're
getting all the claims is coming in they're getting all the claims because again as I said we have to get invoice first pay those invoices and then submit
those invoices it takes time so it is just an excuse because we are we are you know our budget is based on a core basis
so we don't have to get the cash to recognize them right away in our books so it is just uh as I said it's you know
it's they wanted to cut it they cut it and it's looking for ways to explain that hey you're not claiming as much as
you you should so therefore we're going to stop it listen the state gave us a
billion dollars when we had 20,000 people in our care yes we have 40 close to 40,000 does it make any sense to say
you're going to cut funding at this point in time but it's also pretty at 20 you give us a billion dollars at 40
you're saying you don't need it anymore it makes no sense no I understand what you're saying i just I find it unusual
that the state is citing that their reduction in um budget lines for spec
you know for for this the cost of asylum seekers due to the fact that we have all
of this extra money knowing that the reason that the money hasn't come in is because of the you know the the the way
that the process was laid out was made it more complicated to do that so it almost feels like you're being penalized
for something that was out of your control okay exactly all right so could you
could you just repeat um how was what was the uh the amount spent today of the
4.3 no they didn't give us 4.3 they as I said to you directly they gave us 2.6
2.6 okay um the money is already spent okay it's already spent already spent we
spent $7.7 billion as of last month and if you include this month after $200
million you're talking about $7.9 billion okay that we did not plan on
spending no understood okay it's already spent it's just a question of claiming the money we claim so far $1.25 billion
and we're in a process for submitting more claims to them okay thank you
[Music] um in the preliminary plan 1.43 for
three billion in fiscal year 26 was transferred from DHS's budget to other city agencies that the administration
projected would be involved in asylum seeker response efforts in the executive plan 781.5 million was transferred back
to DHS from other uh agencies for fiscal year 26
why were the um these funds shifts why why were these funding um shifts between
DHS and other city agencies made in the preliminary plan and why were these shifts partially rescended in the
executive uh prior to the preliminary plan uh all asylum seeker funding was kept in the uh
DHS uh budget in the outs uh because uh there was uh no cost
forecast yet for fiscal year 26 and the outers uh in the asylum in the preliminary plan
we published an asylum seek forecast for 26 we projected cost of $2.6 $6 billion
so therefore we had to reallocate resources uh uh to uh across agencies based on the
state uh of uh of our operations at that time
do you does the administration expect that DHS is going to fully take over the city's asylum seeker response efforts in fiscal year 26 and beyond the goal is to
consolidate okay okay if uh do you know when and and
and what the transition plan is yeah we they in a transition we're in a
transition to do this and uh our goal is um uh we on track to close all but four
non DHS sites by July 1st okay and um so you know and
thereafter we begin to cons you know the consolidation of all uh the uh migrant
into one system okay um while the executive plan includes an additional 36.1 million bringing the CFC
um fiscal budget fiscal 2026 budget um up to 57 million it is not enough to
address the critical need of this program food pantries and soup kitchens are often the only choice for some of
our city's most vulnerable residents which is why the council has long supported and pushed for the expansion of this program i'm still concerned that
the funding was not baseline or increased to meet the growing need in fiscal year 26 and beyond the threat and
actuality of federal funding cuts has already impacted the provider network and will cause food pantries to rely
more heavily on CFC and city funding as part of the fiscical year 26 preliminary budget response the council called on
the administration to add 79.1 million in CFC baseline to both restore one-time
fun uh funding in fiscal year 25 and to expand the annual budget for program to
100 million in the general welfare executive budget hearing H testified that the agency would work closely with
OM on adjusting CFC funding what is the actual spending thus far in fiscal year
25 for CFC and how much was spent in fiscal year 24 um for fiscal year 26 we
added u 36 million for 700 community kitchens and food pantries citywide um
uh program connection with the community food uh connection uh program so we have
a budget of more than $50 million we also added $10 million in fiscally 26
for the go to go program again as I said uh we know as uh we get closer to
adoption be more than happy to work with you and council uh to see uh what can be
done if uh you know if we believe that there's a budget need we will try to
work with you and the council to see what can be done yeah but we added some
um from our perspective some significant resources in the executive budget it's about over $50 million right now yeah
the the food pantry i know that yeah the lines have gotten so long i mean even
way past the you know beginning of the the pandemic um when we expected that
they would decrease they've only gotten bigger you know longer um I I have one around the corner from
where I live and I in that line used to you know never made it to my building and is actually surpassing my building
at this point um which is a sight to see you know it's really um it's
heartbreaking but at the same time you know so grateful that those resources do exist to help New Yorkers that really
desperately need them um so is is the analysis of of need um that OMB has done
to assess the budget sufficient or is conversations with OM being had with H
regarding this we we we'll have a discussion with Char but again we kept the budget at the same level that we had
last year so is there any intention to baseline at any point again if uh we
could identify long-term funding we will always try to uh do the right thing but
again as I said you know we it's not easy to find long-term funding source to
baseline all the programs that uh from our perspective need to be baseline so we have to take each one program at a
time and see what can be done and if the resources are there we try to do the right thing i know it's not an easy
position to be in um over the past several years DSS has
underbudgeted for key entitlement programs funded through both DHS and HR there has been a misalignment between
the adopted budgets for these programs and the actual year-end expenditures for cash assistance city fees non-assign
seeker shelter costs and house uh housing considerable amounts of additional funding are uh typically
added throughout the fiscal year to meet the demand for the programs during the fiscal uh year 2026 executive budget
hearing for the committee on general welfare DSS informed us that they were working closely with OM to look at the
baseline and project um and and project uh the level of need for these programs
uh can you explain how OM works with the SS to project the budget needs for um
crucial entitlement programs and how are actual expenditures in prior fiscal years considered in this analysis and
budgeting for future years yeah we um we review different factors when we trying
to analyze the need uh for these programs it's not just prior year
spending we look at the ongoing trend current case load policy changes so we
look at a number of factors when we make uh those uh consideration um but again
we always in close discussion with the agencies
uh to make sure that uh to review the needs of the program on ongoing basis
and keep adding resources as needed okay so we will continue to do the same thing
that we've been doing in the past uh to make sure that the programs are you know are well funded appropriately funded
okay so I'm assuming that you're having ongoing conversations on on the budgeting
matters throughout the year okay um does OMB anticipate uh reforming the
projections techniques to accurately budget for for vital programs to match the level of need or is it more of a
funding it's again as I said we look at different factors and and we are in
constant communication with the agencies to monitor the trend to look at the case load policy changes that they
implementing what are the ramification of policy changes so we look at a bunch of factors as uh we examine access these
programs and but more importantly we're in constant communication with the agencies and throughout the year we mark
their budget okay to make sure that they have the resources to address the needs that they you're comfortable then with
the current um technique that you uses okay okay thank you so much thank you
okay we've been joined by Council Member Abrau on Zoom and now we have questions from Majority Leader Faras followed by
Council Member Carr thank you Chair good morning everyone
i'd like to begin um with some maternal health questions in our budget response the council called on the administration
to provide 15.7 million in additional baseline funding starting fiscal year
2026 to support maternal health programs and services these include the maternity
infant reproduction program newborn home visiting program nurse family partnership and universal home visiting
program given the critical services that these programs provide to women and families why was no additional funding
added to the executive budget to further support maternal health programs um currently we have uh uh I believe 34
uh million dollars um and um this funding alone is allow over 12,000 uh
additional families to receive uh these services we will continue to um monitor the needs
and we'll work with the council if uh there are additional needs uh to be addressed and as I said as we move
toward adoption if resources are available we'll uh you know look at the needs to see if there is do an
assessment needs needs assessment if they the needs are there and resources are available we will have a discussion
with the council we'd like to have those discussions I mean maternal health has not improved over several years
explicitly for black women in New York City and I'm sure across the tri burough
state as well but we know that there's an excessive need so we you know I personally would like to know if you
could commit to reviewing the budget for these programs for the adoption and commit for additional funding
as I said you know we uh will work uh with the council and um and if resources
are available we'll have a discussion about uh what needs to be done okay and then how does this decision align with
the goal of healthy NYC to reduce maternal deaths in New York City and pro and improve family health out incomes if
we're just going to continue conversations and review we know we've assessed in the past that we have a high
need in New York City it's not just conversation as I said we added in the in the plan we have $34 million added
so it's not just words we they added we we adding resources uh to these programs
however if there's you know if there are more needs uh and resources are available as we go get to close closer
to adoption we will have a discussion about you know if there are additional needs we will try to address them okay
i'm sure the council and the speaker on you know we'll continue the conversations with you as this is a
priority for us and the council um I have some questions on New York City tourism and conventions we anticipate
that the number of tourists visiting the city in the current year will trail 2024's 64.1 million level um NYCTC
estimates that the city will have 400,000 more domestic travelers than last year but 800,000 fewer foreign
travelers clearly the Trump administration's policies are somewhat to blame for this downturn but in light
of that the city should be doing everything possible we can to support tourism yet in the executive plan the
administration only partially restored 3 million to cuts to NYC tourism and convention the preliminary plan included
20 million for EDC to support World Cup marketing and quote unquote fan events
could the administration repurpose some of this funding for New York City tourism and conventions in fiscal year
26 considering the overlap in purpose and goals uh that was a commitment I already made
to the uh uh to FIFA uh world cup to bring uh the um world cup uh uh to the
um um to the city um but again we will uh
again continue to work with uh um uh tourism and New York City tourism and
conventions and um you know they have revised down their forecast uh of uh uh
tourism for fisc for 2025 basically based on the projection of a decrease in
international travel and uh if we believe there is a need for them to um
ramp up their campaign overseas we will work with them okay i mean yesterday
many of us in the council and I'm sure other folks in the administration received an email from president and CEO
Julie Coker explicitly stating that 700 plus members of NYCTC
um support the FY26 ask um they're stating that if with without the full
restoration of the 7 million allocation they'll be forced to scale back its global marketing reach and campaign
burrowwide community marketing programs and beyond and as we know the burrowwide
campaigns are the ones that produce local small economy boosts in our commercial corridors and so will the
administration restore the full 7 million for New York City tourism and convention in the adopted plan huh the
total amount that went in this plan was $3 million but over the course of uh the
year the amount that's been added to tourism is $3.5 million so the FY26
value ends up being 21.6 million which is basically the baseline level so from
our perspective they're restored understand that they still perceive a need in terms of global markets and
we'll continue to work with them um going forward well we had a cut last budget that wasn't restored at the end
of FY25 and we're looking now at an even more with tariffs federal level
conversations we're seeing a decrease in turnout in our tourism which will then decrease the revenue generated in the
city and impact our economy so if you're saying you're going to have conversations with NYCTC on what their
needs are and assess how we're going to help support them and really support this city and the tri-state area and the
state quite frankly with the revenue that we generate from New York City alone um that would mean that you could
commit to re reinstating their $7 million to ensure that they're fully funded and baselined
in terms of restoring them um just looking at their current level they're fully restored um okay but again
understand again again we understand the challenge again what Supreme is making i
believe we restored it last last last You partially restored it last time i'm still the chair of the committee yeah so
uh but again we will continue to work with them as I said if they have a plan to tackle international tourism and to
try to bring tours uh to New York City we'll work with them to see what can be done i'll make sure to follow up with
NYCTC and make sure they express what their spreadsheet says in the books and why they need the 7 million and I'll
make sure to follow up with you folks sure thank you chairs thank you folks thank you uh OM has requested just a
quick bathroom break we'll take a 10-minute break and we'll continue with Council Member Carr followed by Lewis
turn the mic turn the mic
good morning good morning could I have everybody go back to their seats we're going starting momentarily also there's
no food or drinking in the chambers and no one may approach the deis thank you
[Applause] okay we're going to resume now with questions from Council Member Carr
followed by Council Member Lewis thank you Chair Director good to see you and your team as always thanks for being
here and answering our questions um I want to talk about road resurfacing um in the fiscal year 2024 uh the mayor's
preliminary management report indicated that DOT surfaced 1,177 lane miles that fiscal year
including bike lane miles about shakes out to about $200,000 a mile just a
little under that and in the preliminary budget response the council asked for an additional $40 million for road
resurfacing in order to return us to the 1300 lane mile budgeted target that we
used to have uh prior to fiscal year 2020 and as we've discussed in the past that was reduced to,00 lane miles
because of the fiscal realities induced by the pandemic we're many years removed from that now and I'm wondering why we
have not returned to the 1300 lane mile target given that it is an imperative if I think anyone who uses our roads
whether it's a cyclist or a driver can tell you that or a bus commuter for that matter and we'd like to know what
increase if any has been in the executive plan for lane miles uh and is it in capital or expense funding if so
yeah we are baseline funding for,00 miles 100 miles lane miles in the um and
50 bike lane uh miles in the um a few years ago
um again it's
um it's a capacity issue uh from what we understand based on our discussion with
DOT they have uh the capacity issue in terms of uh you know the
um labor they have a bunch of challenges that they have to uh address uh
materials and equipments Um but again we will uh I'll have a conversation with
them again okay to see um you know whether or not the um these things those
concerns can be addressed and if they can be addressed you know we will have a
discussion i think they can because when Commissioner Rodriguez and DOT testified here I asked them this question and they
indicated a capacity and a willingness to return to the 1300 lane mile standard and I think if we commit to that even in
the out years then it makes their planning processes easier i'd have a discussion with him appreciate that um
I'd like to move on to curbside e-waste um that was previously a pilot program that we had in Staten Island for uh the
pickup of electronic waste um which can no longer be landfilled unlike the rest of the city or large parts of it we do
not benefit from the ecycle program which services buildings with uh at least 10 units or more um and it's a
$3.5 million program that was cut in the last fiscal year and I'm asking that it
be restored uh is that something that can be explored as we reach the conclusion of this year's budget process
yeah the challenge we have is uh the efficiency of that program again I'll
have a discussion again with the commission s the um sanition commissioner but the challenge we had
was uh um we collect very little tonnage out of this program and so you know you know can you
want to add to it but is well I think I think that was true because originally the program was supposed to be expanded
yet another casualty of the co budget situation um and I think if we had scaled up as we intended to the other
burrows we would have gotten to the tonnage needed and so I think the first step towards getting back to a city-wide
program is restoring the the pilot in Staten Island the tonnage is has been
really low on that program and you know the efficiency is to is to have uh the
drop off sites right which we've done and uh you know I my understanding is that there are drop off sites uh
available on Staten Island so that uh we can pick up this waste in a in a more efficient manner well there are drop off
sites but the again it's a question of equity right you have a program in which there is pickup service for higher
density communities and you have lower density communities across the five burrows uh that are not getting the
benefit of that service so I think to say like oh well just drop them off in the one site we have in Staten Island
where they could be dropped off and I know there's popup events but it's really not sufficient to meet the need
so if the issue is efficiency then let's talk about actually scaling the program up citywide like was actually intended
rather than not restarting it at all okay as I said we'll have a conversation
with the commissioner thank you director thank you chair okay we have questions from Council Member Lewis followed by
Williams thank you Chair and good afternoon Director Jiha and your team i
have three quick questions um is our in our council preliminary budget response
we urge the administration to allocate an additional five million to health and hospitals to provide at least one
maternal health focused psychologists within each of its maternity departments i'm concerned about why this request
remains ignored in this executive budget and to what extent will this be
maintained in the outy years second question is in regards to uh the women
forward NYC action plan mayor Adams women forward action plan was a step in the right direction to position New York
City as a national leader in gender equity with an allocation of 43 million
which is a mixture of city and private funding given the proven success and demand for young women's leadership and
development I wanted to know if OM could share with us at least in the city's portion of the 43 million if that would
be increased or at minimum baselined in in the city's portion of women's women
forward NYC and my last question is how does the executive plan address the anticipated rise in discrimination
complaints due to the Trump administration's executive orders the preliminary budget response called for
15 million to be distributed to nonprofit organizations that provide gender affirming care can we expect this
funding to be added to the adoption yeah
um currently uh um H&H when it comes to the uh uh issue uh regarding uh maternal
uh health focus psychologist um H&H from what we understand is
accommodating all patients who need uh this kind of uh
treatment um and uh but again the challenge we all have is uh the
difficulty in term of hiring psychologists because it's not easy you
know because everybody's competing for the same uh but does that mean the 5 million can't be added to the budget or
at minimum a portion of it again as I said we will work with H&H
and see whether or not they believe they need additional resources because from their perspective uh they believe that
they um uh try to accommodate as best as they can the patients but uh if uh again
as part of our discussion with them we'll we'll get a sense you know of uh um what they think they need if there is
a need and we'll come back to you well Dr catz was here for the executive budget hearing and I believe that it's a
need so maybe we all should have a conversation with him okay about how they'll accomplish that regarding Women Forward NYC of the 43 million that the
city has allocated towards that is that going to be baseline are they adding more to that
uh is it baseline no uh is it no I don't know i will get
back to you on this because I don't know if it's baseline or not i will get back to you the 15 million for the nonprofits
for gender affirming care
again we'll come back to you with an answer to this thank you thank you chair
want to welcome PS16 from Council Member Moya's district in Queens thanks for joining us
guys if you have any questions for uh budget chair Jih you let us
know just text me uh now we have questions from Council Member Williams followed by Rustler
thank you um the Commission on Racial Equity requested funding for five
additional staff lines so that they could fulfill their mandates these lines were not included in the plan and CORE
continues to be understaffed um why wasn't the additional funding provided
in the plan for core staffing needs
um we've been uh increasing uh the budget uh uh we've been working with
core we added $2 million in fiscal year 26 and $1.8 million in in TPS funding
during the November plan uh in addition uh we added
$429,000 for for staff in the baseline in the general plan uh for supplemental
staffing the budget right now is like $2.4 million in fiscal year 25 and 4.8
in 26 so uh we've been making uh you know uh
investment into that agency so one of the issues of course is this
two for one hire thing so are you willing to work with them to exempt them
so they can quickly fill the empty staff line and then I know they also requested to roll over the leftover funds um to
allow them to actually hire a GC and a communications
um consultant to fulfill uh some of their mandate so will you allow them to also roll over
their funds um we've been working with them and I from what I understand they are exempted uh from the freeze you said
they are yeah so okay but again I will have a I mean know I have uh um discussion with staff but uh as far as
um we know they are exempted uh from the freeze okay um moving to
CCHR um I think we all know what they're responsible for the council call for the
administration to provide an additional $6 million and the exact plan um and I
know when we had our briefing you mentioned that you had given CCHR um
more funds but it does not seem like that's the case so how does OMB plan to
support CCHR especially in this federal climate um where there appears to be a
lot of focus on reducing the scope of uh people's civil and human rights
i I believe we added in the general plan uh uh resources to their budget uh in
the general plan by like some $556,000 so they could hire uh five uh
folks uh to increase their source of income in their source of income discrimination unit
yeah I know that the request was 6 million and source of income is very important and I know the council has
done a lot of work with the administration on it but there's so many other things that CCHR does or is unable
to do because they don't have the funds to do it for instance the fair housing um act is coming into effect and that
will impact how people are able to get homes and apartments and I don't think
that CCHR has the resources to really enforce that law um again the federal
climate has created more opportunities in a good way for people to seek some
type of reprieve at the local level but I just I just don't think they have the resources to enforce and proactively
educate people around um civil and human rights discrimination and laws that
protect folks in New York City again as I said we will work with them because currently they have a 33
vacancies okay it's just a question of you know hiring those attorneys but we will work with them uh we met with them
and I just want to add it's not just I'm not just seeking um resources for attorneys just even in like their
marketing budget like in previous years um when uh certain things went into
effect I think it was the you know don't don't ask don't tell around the um when
people are applying for jobs whether or not they had a criminal record they did extensive marketing around that law
going into effect but as far as I know they don't have the resources to do robust outreach and marketing around the
city's laws so that people can comply and they don't get fines um So not just
for the legal division but also as a whole um okay last question the mayor's
office equity and racial justice has still not released their preliminary 2024 racial equity plan it's probably I
don't know 400 days late at this point uh which was required um back October
2024 which was push back date one focus of the plan is to help ensure equity is
being considered when formulating the city's budget so what support is OM OM
providing MORJ to ensure the plan is released have you received a copy of the report have you taken any consideration
if you have to the current budget year um and we really only have like a month
left so do you anticipate utilizing this plan in any way um as we move forward in
finalizing fiscal 2026 budget uh I would defer to city hall when it comes to the
question regarding the plan the equity plan uh but again as I said we've been working with them we give them our
feedback on their plan and uh but uh in ter of the release of the plan I would
defer to uh uh city hall because it hasn't been released though and I know the plan is circulating within the
administration do you plan to or have you taken any consideration to this current fiscal
budget as the plan may call or not call for you to do so we always every
decision we make as part of the budget we do them through an equity lens
okay i mean you could see as you could see in the budget we make so many investment and many of the investment as
I said we basically look at them from that perspective so as far as I'm we are
concerned uh we understand what the plan is trying to accomplish but this is
something that we do currently council member Moya
thank you thank you chair sorry for the interruption i just wanted to personally give a shout out to PS16
uh and the civics class that is here today from my district uh thank you to
Miss Amont and also to Mr feldman uh who are here this group uh approached me a
while back and said well what does a council member do uh and I said the best thing they can do is come on tour and
see what's happening and they're seeing how government uh really runs except for James who ill-advisedly came here
wearing a Real Madrid jersey um and uh you know we won't get into that but
thank you so much welcome everyone to the people's house thank you Chair okay questions from Council Member Wrestler
followed by Joseph thank you Chair Brandon i just want to take a second to commend you on doing a
great job through this round of executive budget hearings and and I really want to thank the the whole council finance staff who have been
terrific um good to see you Director Jiha and team see you too um a few
questions just could I couldn't pin you down i couldn't hear in your back and forth with Speaker Adams a number do you
have a number of how much funding you're planning to add on childcare vouchers in the adopted budget uh it's $328 million
you'll be adding $328 million and will that amount allow for will that amount ensure that we are
funded to get the full dollar for-dollar match that the state has afforded us yep that's the uh that's the MOE great thank
you very much so you're that will be in the adopted budget good answer um thank
you uh I love straight answers um I want to move to burrow-based jails uh the
mayor recently proposed uh converting the Brooklyn Buroughbased jail facility into a mental health
facility um and converting the other three sites into housing um is this
proposal seriously being considered by OMB say it again confidence the mayor made
the mayor you know the mayor being the mayor uh said that he wanted to convert the Brooklyn jail project into a mental
health facility and the other three jail sites into housing is OMB seriously considering this proposal as far as we
are concerned everything is going as uh as planned as planned that is such two
for two we're doing great this morning um okay so I just want to
Just because I think it's helpful do you have a sense of how much money has been spent on the Buroughbased jail plan to
date uh to date now hundreds of millions of dollars are we over a billion we um I
know for sure we budgeted 16 billion dollars for total total i just But the burn rate the burn rate in Brooklyn
we're spending tens of millions of dollars a month in Brooklyn alone we now have multiple I would come back to you with an answer on the specific on the
specific uh dramatic I mean we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this project to date we are we have signed
contracts with vendors at each of these sites sure um I'm glad that we are moving ahead as planned and that
whatever the mayor may have been musing about does not seem to be changing the direction of the administration
um the Brooklyn buroughbased jail is supposed to be done in 2029 the other burrows are supposed to be completed in
what years 20 31 31 32 we're in that range so we're still more than 5 years
out from when we're going to complete the plan according to the current timelines that would give us a 5year
capital lifespan window to continue to do work on Riker's Island to make necessary improvements to the crumbling
infrastructure do you believe that it would be beneficial for DOC to apply for a waiver from the controllers's office
and I guess from all of you under directive 10 to wave the to to potentially uh pursue capital
eligibility for projects on Riker's Island i think the concept should change the law from 2027 because that's what
that's what's the problem the waiver is but there's an alternative process the waiver could be per pursued as long as
the 2027 uh law is on the book i mean I would I could talk to the lawyers but as far as I'm concerned as long as the 2027
law is in the book we we are limited to what we can do because we're in 2025
right now so you know it's like only two years so you know concept could change I
mean there but there is an alternative we're not changing it but there is I mean without a serious conversation with this administration um there is which we
have not yet had uh there is a mechanism though that you could pursue a waiver to
pursue for capital discuss it I'll discuss it with the We appreciate you considering it uh Litman Commission were
the Litman Commission 2.0's funding recommendations considered in the crafting of the executive plan yes we
added uh um resources to fund a lot of programs dealing with uh alternative to
incarceration and did you discuss these recommendations with the Litman Commission prior to releasing the executive plan
uh no no but uh we had uh you know we met with them and they gave us a
briefing in terms of uh what the recommendations uh uh will be and we
listen to them and we take them into account last one for me and um thank you
for the modest amount of extended time have you done an updated analysis on the
loss of funding to New York State since on uh the impact of the Republican House bill that passed last week uh we
continue to do our own assessment of uh the bill because as as you I'm pretty sure you know that uh this is not the
final okay could you do you have a number on what your expectation is for
how much lo how much funding would be lost to New York State no approximately $15 billion we don't we don't have we
don't have yet a full bill to do you know full assessment of the entire uh
because we have to wait for the Senate we certainly don't have a bill that's passed both chambers but we have a a
bill that would be catastrophic if it were passed it's a $15 billion loss in funding to the state of New York that
would be very that would be very extremely difficult for New York City to to absorb and is this
is OM aggressively advocating for changes around Medicaid and food stamps
in particular to protect low and moderate income New Yorkers immigrant New Yorkers we uh basically as I said
earlier we uh will fight for every federal dollar
that New Yorkers deserve okay as I said New Yorkers paid their
fair share of federal taxes okay and they should not be penalized yeah
because the city is following state and
city laws i appreciate that i think you've spent many distinguished years in
government at the state level at the city level um I can't imagine that you've ever seen a bill come out of
Washington that would be so catastrophic to the budget of New York State and New
York City as what the House just passed a $15 billion cut in funding to the state of New York more than 5% of their
budget would have broad ramifications on our abilities to fund parks and public safety and school and education early
childhood education and hospitals and more it would the the the scale of the
devastation that this bill would have on vulnerable New Yorkers and on everything
that we care about really can't be understated and so I've appreciated that we've had Molly Park and Mitch Katz and
some of the leaders in this administration speak up about just how catastrophic this would be but we've
heard crickets from the other side of city hall and I know that you get how bad this would be for our budget and
that it would lead to horrible decisions that we do not want to make uh and cuts that we desperately want to avoid and I
hope the mayor starts to listen and get with the program as well because his voice matters here and it would be a helpful thing for him to advocate for
the needs of New Yorkers thank you very much the mayor has continued to advocate for New Yorkers and he will continue
will continue to fight for New Yorkers questions from council member Joseph
followed by Salam thank you chairs um good to see you
commissioner always um so in our in our we understand that New York City public
schools application for Head Start is pending approval at the federal level so we'd like to clarify the changing Head
Start landscape in fiscal 2026 um given the uncertainty and the timing of the approval what is OMBB's plan to ensure
continuation of care in Head Start um and if New York City public schools only
receive partial federal funding or does not receive the grant what is OMB's commitment to stabilizing the Head Start
system and how will that impact the current Head Starts um providers i'm going to ask all my questions at once
because I know my time is limited so when is the latest um OM can recognize federal funding for Head Start in fiscal
2026 without any operational issues um regardless of funding changes in Head
Start for fiscal 2026 can you also explain why OMB is certain that every eligible child that wants a Head Start
seat of any age 0 to four will get one in 2026 and of course special education
um New York City public school also told us about 7,000 students with IEPs were not being provided with one or more of
their mandated services while you baseline $55 million for preschool special education classrooms in the
executive plan so what's the conversation with OM about DOE's new
need um submission for additional funding for preschool special education
how much are they requesting and what's the headcount and why OMB hasn't added any additional funding for preschool
special education services um uh regarding her head start um the um
mayor made a commitment Mhm that uh uh the services are so critical
uh for New Yorkers that uh even in the absence of uh federal funding the city
would step in he made that announcement about I think a month ago you know so he
made that commitment so right now I can't tell you whether or not we're going to get partial funding or whatever
we're going to get but the deal is he made the commitment that But you've also applied for fewer um seats he he applies
for you know so his goal is to make sure that if we seats who need a seats get a
seat you know so again as I said that's a commitment that they already made so therefore it's not going to back away uh
from uh that commitment um special education we added an
additional $555 million like we stated uh in the plan um and uh we will
continue as again as I said um we have we we have uh some discussion and I
believe I'm meeting with the um ten store next week uh to discuss our
priorities okay and as we discuss our priorities I will listen to her and see what she brings to us but what about the
students who have not received none of their services um so we were asking for 70 million in the budget for that we
didn't see that um 70 million for related services you still have about
7,000 students that have not received their mandated services and you know what that leads to our Carter cases that
we constantly fight against and push against so that's why I'm asking okay as I said we I'm meeting with the
chancellor next week and we'll have a discussion about her needs what the priorities are but in the Head Start you
applied for 3,500 fewer Head Start seats for three year olds and four year olds while you age down so does that result
in a decrease for capacity for three and four year olds we will backfill you're going to backfill may I make that
commitment chairs um LGBTQ um plus IA inclusive curriculum we
noticed in the executive plan there was an additional 2.48 million um to fund the LGBTQ plus curriculum this covers
the DOE contract CBO and initiative but the additional 315 through through DYCD
was not funded in the executive why wasn't the funding added to the DCY um DYCD budget in the
executive plan and does OM commit to fully funding the LGBTQ plus IIA
curriculum in 2026 again we will discuss it as part of uh
uh adoption uh process and uh we'll see what we learn you get in in our Ames and
Horizon seats and that's for our autistic learners oh I'm going to get it all in you know
I'm here for the kids so I have to find out because we know that will also reduce our having our horizons nest that
will also reduce our Carter cases that are ballooning sure is that a commitment on the record that
that we will be funding these programs what I say is we'll continue we'll have discussion with the council as uh we
approach adoption and if resources are available we'll discuss the needs more aim seats more nest seats and more
horizon got it thank you thank you chairs council members we've been joined
by council member Sanchez on zoom now we have questions from council member Salam followed by Hudson
good afternoon and thank you director Jiha great to see you and your team good to see you sir thank you
chair so there's a michelama development in my district espanard gardens in
significant need significant need of financial and structural attention and
the residents have been trying to address this since superstar s supererstorm Sandy i want to know how is
OM accounting for Harlem's growing housing and infrastructure needs within the capital plan especially in light of
historical low capital commitment rates in black and brown neighborhoods
um I'm not aware of this one you aware of it the specific we'll have to work
with HPD on the specific development but as it pertains to how we're accounting for Harlem's growing needs we largely
defer to HPD to come up with the program and work with them on the funding of the program which takes into account equity
issues as well as uh various housing needs throughout the bureaus why don't you give us the information
we'll work with your office and get a better sense of that particular project sure okay given that Harlem has one of
the highest concentrations of NICE units what share of the 1 $14.5 million in restored
funding for older adults older adult services is being directed to Nicha's senior centers or naturally occurring
resident communities in Harlem and just for background on in uh on 2201 Adam
Clay Pal Jr boulevard in January 2024 the city announced plans to establish a sanctuary shelter for families at this
particular location the facility was to include approximately 54 rooms operated by the Department of Homeless Services
in partnership with the Children's Rescue Fund a contract provider however the
community raised concerns very very serious concerns about this plan and it was ultimately altered currently the
administration has renew their mission to house shelter families at this location i now find myself along with
many of my colleagues in wondering why the administration has not communicated this with local communities on how they
intend to provide for shelter sheltering these families
okay um in in this plan we added about $81
million uh to deal with some cliffs that uh uh DIA had
uh but regarding the shelter of that particular one you know anything about it that again we'll come
back to you on the specific one because uh this is not on our radar at all okay
we work with our office to get more information on this well thank you
Council Member Hudson thank you so much
um as you know but I'm always going to share the statistics older adults represent 20% of the city's population a
2021 CUNI Graduate Center study reports that the population of adults ages 65
and older in New York State will soar 25% between 2021 and 2040 in the city
alone the population of older adults is expected to increase by 40% by the year 2040 despite the growth in the city's
older adult population and the increased need for resources to repair deteriorating infrastructure NYC aging's
capital budget totals only $85.1 million between fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2029 in
the executive commitment plan was any capital funding added in the executive commitment plan to support NYC aging's
capital needs especially at older adult centers uh as you know in this plan we uh added
uh uh $81 million uh to deal with the uh cliffs and uh we also added 20 almost
$21 million uh for the um restoration of the peg that we have in addition
um we added uh almost $20 million to address the indirect rate sorry 20
million for what the injur rate needed by providers
um it's um this issue about capital needs uh uh
for DIA uh has not been uh brought uh to my attention and I will work with the
commissioner to find out exactly what this is um but um you know I'm I'm not sure
because Okay so I will get back to you after I talk to her to find out exactly what uh the needs are okay so it sounds
like they didn't specifically request any additional capital funding as far as I know i don't know about the staff okay
um do you believe that the current level of capital funding is sufficient given the growing older adult population and
the extensive provider network NYC aging manages again if I don't see the need if they if
they don't discuss the needs with us you know they have to come to us with needs and discuss them but I have not seen
something that's more like on the expense side okay capital budget is very small it is okay that's my point and
yeah it's very small but uh you know the um the their expense budget we try to as
best as we can to take care of all the needs yeah and
listen that money is great i don't want you to touch that money i wanted to just
uh address the the capital needs yeah i do appreciate that um and even when
we're we're given a lot there's always more needed especially given the population increase that we're expecting
in the next 15 years um but let me just move on uh quickly to homed delivered
meals um the council's fiscal 2026 preliminary budget response called on the
administration to add and baseline 7.3 million for the home delivered meals program to bring the per meal
reimbursement rate up to $15.31 from $13.78 to fully cover the actual cost of
food at adoption last year 4.8 million was added in baseline starting in fiscal 2025 to increase reimbursement rates for
homed delivered meals from $12.78 to $13.78 the additional funding for a
reimbursement rate increase for fiscal 2026 was not included in the executive plan we learned at the executive budget
hearing that NYC aging has also been advocating for an increase to me and reimbursement rates and I'd like to know
if OM plans to include this in the adopted plan and if so what reimbursement rate increase will be
included and how much would such an increase cost yeah we continue to work with uh Jifa uh to um uh review the
ongoing needs and around food and are open to um further
discussion uh in the as part of the adopted budget process okay we're we
like an openness to continued discussion so I'll take that um has OMB considered
permitting a different reimbursement rate for meals that meet the cultural needs and the needs of those with
specific health conditions which typically typically cost more than an average meal
again we will have discussion with Jifa okay see uh you know what what the
difference in terms of the variance in term of cost and we'll review accordingly and uh you know Okay i'll be
sure to follow up but I just want to make sure that we're also as part of that conversation um under thoroughly understanding the
the needs for different types of meals and the costs that are associated with that thank you thank you chairs okay
questions council member Brewer followed by Riley thank you very much um my first question is about the department of
investigation in our preliminary response the council requested that the executive include an
additional three million in baseline for DOI to hire 13 additional personnel and
cover a shortfall of their funding for 22 existing vacancies the funding was
not in the exec and why was it not provided in light of DOI's mandated
responsibilities and there will there be additional funding in the adopted plan i know sometimes you say because they
haven't filled their positions i I know I could almost give you the answer however it's my feeling strongly that
they are working hard to fill those positions they need the extra funding because of all of the extra
opportunities that's the if that's the right word to uh make sure there's no fraud and other improprieties in our uh
administration and the thing is if they don't have the funding then they don't have the ability to do the extra hiring
that would enable them to do the oversight yeah and um I understand uh your concern
and uh um we um we've been working with them in the preliminary plan uh we gave
them about $750,000 so they could hire 10 uh folks
so that could build their investigative staff and support staff uh in addition we made uh some salary
adjustment uh for them to assist them to help them with retention of certain
position we are currently working with them and I believe we just approve some
PS uh for them okay and that would be
reflected uh in adoption at adoption uh but we're working with them const you
know on a day-to-day basis to u make sure that they have the resources that they need to uh take advantage of the
opportunities like we word it uh that is uh you know open to them okay i mean I I
would say we keep pushing on that issue because they've been using some of their assets for your money which is not what it's supposed to be used for yeah but we
as I said we we working with them and I believe last week we provided them some approval okay okay we'll keep pushing
yep um next issue of course at the Department of Education there's also a DOI office not part of the DOI citywide
and that has only like a $6 million uh budget um and it's called SCI school uh
and the issue is they have 55 staff members for a uh agency that's got a $40
billion budget and 140,000 uh person uh staffing so my question is maybe they're
not pushing enough maybe I'm pushing for them but it does seem to me if you're looking at I hate to say fraud and
corruption i don't want to say that it's rampant it's not at DOE but 140,000
you're going to find people so my question is are you thinking about increasing funding for this particular oversight agency uh I have not seen a
request coming to me from them they uh they had a request for OTPS funding
which we provided them but again I would just discuss with my staff to see if
they have received something i just think generally I'm not getting into CCB i'm not getting into Department of
Correction etc but we need more oversight i'm not saying is this administration is any administration
oversight keeps corruption and loss of funding down other question is about uh
clubouses you know this is an ongoing issue larger clubouses are funded but we need $4 million for the smaller
clubouses the city council had to pick it up before do you have any interest in this $4 million very smart keeps people
with mental illness off the street and mental illness issues are a focus of all
of us we need $4 million for clubouses we put that in the exec in this plan we
added $4 million to continue the existing uh
clubhouse services for the big ones how about for the smaller ones there's two different RFP went out for the larger
ones i'm talking about the smaller one so far no RFP um well again as I said uh we will uh
discuss this uh uh in uh as part of adoption because again uh that swap came
to us in term of request and uh you know I will discuss it with uh DOMH and see
if uh there is uh something specific that they were interested in they want
we're interested i don't know about them we're interested just so you know um school-based mental health clinics i
know the speaker to her credit talked about this uh we need another 3.75 million to cover what Medicaid does not
and I have to say as you do that the school-based mental health clinics are where the problems can be um dealt with
before they end up on the street or end up at Rikers or any other issue so what's the status with uh support for
school-based mental health clinics in the schools um again uh we could we will follow up
uh with you and your office uh on this and um because as I
said uh if we don't have the request coming from the agencies you know we uh but we'll follow up with you okay um
when Molly Park was here an excellent commissioner she said of course that there could be a savings of $11 million
you know when all of the FEPs are used and people are back in their housing the
trouble is uh cost of feeps could go from 30% to 40% of anyone's uh rent the
there are about 1,800 1,800 people who have will be affected in this five-year
cycle uh there's some fear that some of them will go back to the shelters because of
the increase in rental that they have to pay so my question is have you uh figured in your budget um when this
Reich rent hike goes into effect that people could be back in shelter wouldn't it make more sense to keep it at 30%
again our goal is uh we don't want people to go back to shelter but at the same time we're also at the same time
trying to make sure that the program is feasible okay in term of uh in the long
run so therefore we have to find ways to manage it it's a program that started at about $300 million 5 years ago and it's
about like $1.2 billion now mhm so it's a good allocation of funding it works i
understand we understand but at the same time you know we are also uh uh resource
uh constraint so therefore we have to find a way at the pace that it's growing is going so fast that it it could
threaten the viability of the program itself oh but so you haven't figured in anybody going back to shelter as part of
this funding i they just they have not yet implemented the program yet so
therefore we don't know okay i'm just letting you know that some of them will go back and you should figure out keep it at 30% would make sense i understand
your difference of opinion um finally food um I know that you heard a little bit from uh Council Member Ayella but
obviously the pantries the soup kitchens and so on are desperate what is your thinking about any any increased
allocation just generally for all the food concerns that we're all facing with our constituents yeah as I said we added
uh uh resources uh about uh um 36 uh I believe um $50 million where we have $36
million to the uh uh CFC uh program we also added $10 million for go to
groceries to go program but again as I said to uh the uh uh council member um
you know we will continue to have discussion with her and city council and during adoption and if resources are
available and the needs are there we'll have a discussion okay thank you very much okay questions from council member
Riley followed by Denowitz thank you chair uh good afternoon to the administration thank you so much for
being here today uh just a few questions in the executive plan DOA DOH MH was
allocated 47.3 million for mobile treatment teams in fiscal year 2026 we
first thought that this was funding that was going to be an expansion of the program but later realized that this is
rather to replace expiring funding from the American Rescue Plan these are
critical services that have proven to be effective and we have requested in our budget response with the administration
to add another 30 million to expand these teams why wasn't there an additional funded added to the executive
budget for the mobile treatment teams uh as you know funding as you know funding is very limited so what we first do to
begin with was to say hey the program is funded with stimulus dollars okay let's
try to make sure okay we could backfill it to begin with all right to make sure because otherwise if we don't find those
resources to make sure to to back fill the program you know basically the program would go away so that's the
first thing we have to do okay and then as we go forward and then we we will do an assessment of the program to see if
additional resources are needed the average wait time for the individual to enter the assertive community treatment
or the act is 93 days which is long wait for someone dealing with severe mental
services have you spoken with DOM MH about additional resources that would significantly decrease the weight times
we will have we'll engage them to see if uh there is a challenge on their part why the wait time is so long and if the
uh if uh uh the uh discussion is about uh uh resources not the process because
sometimes process are broken and you could give you you know more resources
it's not going to solve the problem so we'll have a discussion with them and see where you know why the wait time is
so long if it's a process will you report back to the council after you of course we will thank you there are
currently 16 schoolbased and this uh is a part of council member Brewer's question as well there are currently 16
schoolbased mental health uh clinics funded with 5 million uh through H&H DOE
and DOH this is one of the most impactful programs as council member Brewer just mentioned that needs to be
baselined at adoption and we have been advocating for at least 2 years about this why has this program not been
baseline and what is OMB's plan to finally baseline funding for mental health continuum uh starting fiscal year
2026 uh our goal is to be honest with you we always would always love to baseline
funding for programs is just a question of of course identifying the long-term funding and we have so many competing
needs you know and so we have to make decisions about hey when we find those dollars which program you're going to
baseline long you know provide long funding for them long term but again we continue to review those programs and as
resources become available if we have uh you know long-term res source of funding this is some program that is worth you
know exploring uh funding for it long term we will do so but again it's just a
question of identify first the long-term funding and but if it's not available
it's not available you know okay chair if I may thank you 988 is the city's
dedicated hotline for New Yorkers to call for all of their medical excuse me their mental hygiene needs including
mental health concerns and additional services we know that this year the program experienced a call and text
volume of 335,000 doh testify that they believe
this volume would increase if more New Yorkers were aware of this uh number 988
the program is funded at 21.8 million in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 which is a
decreased number of 10.9 million compared to fiscal year 2024 what are the factors that contribute to such a
decrease and do you plan to restore the 10.9 million in fiscal year 2026 adopted
budget i believe what happened is uh DHMH reached an agreement with the
vendor and you know and the agreement is cheaper okay so therefore that's the
reason but it won't cut the services it won't cut services all right and my last question is more of a a district
question um I represent Co-op City um and if you don't have this number now you could provide it for me later on
currently Co-op City operates their own public safety um and their own sanitation um but they're seeing uh
needs in the community do you have a number of how much um I guess funding uh
co-op city saving the city by operating their own public safety and sanitation process if you don't um can you please
uh update me as soon as possible uh so we could figure out how the city could address other concerns uh that co-op
city has such as public safety and quality of life issues my staff will reach out to you with an answer thank
you thank you chair okay questions from council member Denowitz
thank you chair good afternoon Mr director um very simple question would
you say it is better to have more students or more people in New York City enrolled in college or not more more we
want more right um a few years ago this council uh piloted a program called CUTUNI Reconnect which in the past three
years has resulted in more than about 47,000 more students attending CUNI um
you're you're a money guy you know this is good more people in New York City going to attending college getting
degrees earning more that's good for our tax base fewer people on public assistance for a program that's so
incredibly successful year after year why was zero funding allocated for CUNI
reconnect uh as you know this plan was very good for Kuni we It was what i'm sorry very
good very good for CUNI this budget and they're very happy with the plan that we
have um we gave we restored $91 million
uh for uh CUNI uh $96 million and we baseline
uh those uh funds we gave them $9.1 million for Yeah i just want to pause
there are good things in the budget to be certain but to be clear those were cuts that you all made so you're
restoring your own cut so I just want to be honest about the conversation we're having i'm simply want to ask about
Reconnect and for a program for a program that brings more students in 47,000 over three years more students
getting degrees getting the supports they need to succeed and go back into our communities and contribute more
that's exactly what we want people to do in this city uh 11.8 million would go a
long way will that be included in the adopted plan we will have discussion with the city council this is a program
that is very close to the heart of the speaker that is a program that she you know basically advocated for so we will
work with the council as we get closer to adoption to see what can be done
getting no commitments there but uh I I'll repeat this is as you know again an incredibly successful program that the
speaker spearheaded uh and this is an investment this is a good investment that is good policy and it's good
finances um one of the things that the um I would say the mayor does very well
and I think is very powerful for a lot of kids in this city is he speaks openly about having a disability um and I think
that is very important to see people in leadership positions saying that out
loud it is also important to include policy and budget items that support that value uh the council requested $2.1
million for disability services for CUTUNI students to ensure that more that
that they have the resources they need so that our students have the accommodations and support they need this was also omitted from the executive
budget um and today can we commit to including this on the mayor's side the $2.1 million in the adopted plan we'll
have discussion with you and the city council as we move toward the budget adoption i said but this is more than a
this this is the discussion this is the public discussion and this is critical and you have this is the beginning of
the discussion this isn't the beginning the the this is not the beginning that's
a little silly to say um the the you know we're talking about investments just a few million dollars that will get
more students enrolled in CUNI more students to stay enrolled in CUNI more students to
graduate more students and then graduates to to provide more for our tax
base and also including more of those students who are historically underrepresented and historically left
behind including people with disabilities and I would think as a as a mayor who understands this probably more
intimately than most anyone uh in this room any one of us up here he should be the first one saying we need to invest
this small amount of money $2.1 million to ensure people like him have a better
chance of success at CUNI as I said to you we we will work with you and the
council because as I said you know we have limited resources we added uh a lot
of resources to Kun's budget in the exact budget that were taken away by you in years past yes we love this question
let's I I think it's important to be honest about that and important to recognize that these aren't expenditures
these are investments and I would just add as it relates to CUNI reconnect that
at a time when we have a federal government that is doing everything they can to reduce the enrollment of
international students and immigrant students at CUNI we should be doing everything we can in this city to be
recruiting people to ensure that they have a shot at a college education and that is our job here in the city and we
should be doing everything we can to push back against these policies of the federal government that are harming our
students here that are harming our city and harming our public colleges thank you chair
okay uh Deputy Speaker
sorry I had a couple of follow-up questions on the first question is on
immigration the executive uh plan does not include any dedicated funding for legal services for unaccompanied minors
despite the growing need and the loss of critical federal support on March 21st the federal government abruptly
terminated the unaccompanied uh children's program contract cutting nearly 14 million for New York City
legal providers this decision left more than 1300 children without an attorney and some already have court hearings
scheduled has uh Moya or HA requested additional funding for unaccompanied children for fiscal year 26
uh as far as I'm concerned I'm not aware of that but I know for sure we added uh
resources um for uh Moya in the budget for legal services but for spec
specifically for those uh children I'm not aware of any requests coming to us
for those specific children okay could you could you I will double check that back to me thank you i mean it's it's
pretty scary because we we have children now you know just yesterday we had a a high schooler that was detained um and
you know this is the beginning of what we anticipate will be a long form we remain committed to supporting
immigration legal services as I said we added $42 million in the budget for for the for fiscally 26 but for the specific
children I'm not aware but I will follow up with you okay so given that the new the New York City continues to serve as
a key destination for immigrant youth many of whom arrive fleeing violence poverty and instability what steps is
the city taking to coordinate with nonprofit legal service providers to ensure continuity of care for these children and also making sure that these
children do not appear in court alone again as I said I will follow up with uh
uh uh with uh Moya to uh see what they're doing and we'll report back to
you okay do you commit to supporting um to support the funding request of 6.3
million needed in fiscal year 26 for legal service support for unaccompanied minors uh again as I said I cannot make
a commitment at this point in time but we'll uh review the needs and as we progress toward adoption and then we'll
have a discussion okay um at the preliminary budget hearing Commissioner Schaefer testified that nearly 100,000
applications for asylum work authorization and temporary protected status have been filed since the opening
of the asylum application help center assuming that um OASO is coordinating
all this work for asylum seekers with CBOS why is there no funding allocated
for OSO in the executive budget beyond the 3.2 million added in fiscal year uh
25's preliminary budget and what is the future of the the office's staffing if
the office is closed uh closing starting fiscal year 26 uh again we are still assessing the
future of funding level for OASO uh as we move toward uh one system with
the DHS system so you know um we don't expect to have uh any uh impact on
services uh as we move toward fully integrated DHS uh system going forward but again we
uh we're still assessing you know the future funding level needed for so as we
transition from uh the current system that we have with the herks toward a
fully integrated DHS system so you don't anticipate any disruption to services no
do you anticipate any cuts to staffing and that that that currently staff that office we I'm not anticipating that but
uh you know but again it's the level of service we don't anticipate that level of service to be impacted because you
know uh DHS will take over uh whatever they're doing and we we will see you
know where we're going to end at the end of the day with uh uh but uh as you know
city doesn't you know cut uh just uh you
know lay off folks for the sake of lay off people we sometimes we assign folks
we do different things but again at this moment in time we assessing you know where they're going to be because again
as I said uh we anticipated a significant uh uh decline in the census
but lately there has been a slowdown okay in the number of people leaving the
system so again we'll see where we where we land uh in in the future but right
now we are not uh um expecting to see um
staff uh layoff okay or any such thing all right um during the uh health and
hospitals executive budget hearing last week we discussed the urgent need to expand emergency rooms at Metropolitan
and Elmherst Hospitals with Dr katz and his team the Metropolitan ER expansion will cost well it you it was estimated
at 65 I believe now it's 111 million um and the cost of the Elmherst ER
expansion has not been determined yet does OM believe these capital projects are feasible in the short term and what
are the potential challenges with these capital projects and what are the roadblocks to allocating the necessary
funding uh we would need an assessment from H&H uh uh so that we could have a
better sense of uh what the needs are and what can be done i mean we I'll just tell you
personally Metropolitan happens to be in my district and we've been working with that hospital and been able to um
allocate a significant amount of resources to upgrading some of the equipment and and the spaces that are used by patients but the hospital hasn't
really been renovated since it was uh constructed the emergency room is um has
capacity for 25 patients and they um often have you know double that amount
and so people are like scattered everywhere the conditions are just not um ideal for providing um basic uh uh
you know medical services the rooms are still rooms that are closed in um where
the staffing um nurses and doctors are not even able to see the patients from
where they are so I I've never been to Elmherst i can't speak to that but I I would assume that they have similar
issues and um we have been trying to get this hospital like on the list of
priorities for you know quite a number of years and and so this year you know obviously have been pushing a little bit
more aggressively um just because it's really um it's in really bad condition
like if you see it you you probably be a little bit offended by we will have a discussion with H&H okay and then I
guess my final plug because this is my final um budget um we did have uh you
know I want to thank you know uh former mayor Delasio was very gracious and and
helping us uh get the the acquired funding for the esplanade renovation um however through the resoning of East
Harlem we were able to get the north side of the esplanade done and then um a
few years ago we were allocated the funding for the south side but there were 10 blocks in the middle that are still falling into the river that are
currently blocked off to uh pedestrian traffic that were not funded for some reason um so I'm just putting it out in
the universe because I don't I think if we're going to invest so much money in making it beautiful it doesn't make any
sense to leave those 10 blocks that are like squarely in the middle um out of the planning process okay I will I will
talk with the uh is it EDC to find out what's going on thank you okay
okay i just have a couple of cleanup questions from some of my colleagues uh quickly about Mox the service desk so
the executive plan includes uh 1 and a.5 million in baseline funding starting in
FY26 excuse me to hire 20 staff for the Mox service desk can you confirm that
Mox has approval to hire for all their vacant positions uh yes
okay because we heard during the April 30th hearing on late payments to human
service providers um the we were told at the hearing OMB allowed agencies to hire
for 183 positions that were involved with processing human service providers but we were trying to understand why
those positions were subject to the hiring freeze in the first place um we um we have exempted
uh uh those contract staff from the 241 have they always been exempted or just
recently uh we I think it's recently i'm not sure recently say it recently okay
does OM keep track of of vacancy rates by positions at at the agency level
we keep track of vacancies for each agency and uh you know to know exactly
uh what how many vacancies they have and uh you know and if there is a need for
us to exempt some titles some positions that uh we believe is critical we do so
so what's the estimated savings in the budget from the existing hiring freeze
uh I could give you I don't have that number in front of me but I would give it to you i'll send you that uh that
estimate and do you have the the total value of the PS acrruels in the current year i would also provide you that
information as well okay and also add to the list how much
would the city underspend its budget if there was a 5% average vacancy rate in FY26
okay i would provide you okay um DSNY the the bid
containerization requirement has OM conducted or reviewed a a cost analysis
of the containerization compliance and the burden that it would place on bids and nonprofit sanitation partners
i believe um the um the um commissioner has been working
with the bid uh to uh but they told us they they paused it to the end of the year but
they didn't say what would happen from there yeah uh you know I know they've been working together uh in terms of uh
uh to see what they can do uh to provide the most suitable and the most cost
effective uh way of uh uh getting this done but
again we will work with the council uh as part of the adapted budget to determine if uh there's anything that
can be done the council's concerned about any potential downstream fiscal impact on the sanitation budget and
operations if bids and nonprofits can no longer provide supplemental sanitation
services i'm not sure that the administration is considering that yeah we we're looking into that as well
and lastly on the NYC bin reimbursement requirement so back in February we
passed uh intro 1126A requires DSNY to provide official
NYC waste bins at no cost or reimburse eligible small property owners one to two family homes who have already
purchased the bins um has OMB received any updated cost projections from DSNY
for implementing uh this bill um we
um the bins that we have currently are the cheapest to be honest with you it's like
$50 and um you know and uh so again we
estimate it's uh you know probably $36 million
uh to provide uh uh the bins but um again from my perspective is
um we have some of the best quality B right now and you know at around
$50 it's uh from my perspective is a reasonable responsibility of city property owners to buy those things at
uh at the price that was basically negotiated by GSNY which is a very good
price so is OM going to allocate funding to support the mandate um again we will
work with the council you know to see if uh you know what can be done but uh you
know what what uh what would be the optimum level of funding that's needed as part of uh back and forth with uh the
council but again you know we we we uh we intend to work with you and if
resources are available we will come back to you and make your recommendation
okay director that is everything I've got thank you very much it's been great working with you and look forward to uh
landing the plane next month great working with you as well sir thank you all right we'll take a break about I
don't know 10 15 minutes and then Oh sorry 1:30 we're going to start 1:30 we'll be back and we'll hear
from the controller thanks
If if we have one more for C yes we're going to give one more to council member Brewer she'll do it she'll do it yes all
right i think we have them for the record any other council members who want a hard copy you have to request it
along with a paper straw [Laughter]
you don't have to fill out a form with the reason you want the plastic straw or
the report but you do have to request it

thank you uh Chair Brandon and Council Member Brewer thank you very much for the opportunity to testify and the
slight flexibility i'm coming from the City College commencement which is just about the most hopeful thing you could
be at in the world uh wow the future looks bright in those young people
graduating from City College today overwhelmingly first generation and immigrants are children of immigrants um
but still I'm very excited to be here and joined by Executive Deputy Controller Franchesco Bundeszy and Deputy Controller for Budget Crystal
Olsen who prepared our office's full analysis of the fiscal year 2026 budget
and accompanying financial plan when I came before you in March I noted that
our city's need for strong fiscal management had never been more urgent the threats posed by the Trump
administration to New York City to our people our economy our finances have unfortunately only intensified since
then with the dizzying back and forth and actual implementation and court rulings of the tariffs the Trump
administration has introduced chaos into the global economy and created extraordinary levels of uncertainty it
has meanwhile attempted to terminate pause or rescend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants recently
already awarded to the city through its flurry of executive orders and policy
changes and this is even before considering the potential devastation that the congressional budget
reconciliation bill could have on federal aid to the city government to the state and directly to New Yorkers it
was in this environment already back in March that the Adams administration bllidly released what it called the best
budget ever almost like mocking all of us with little recognition of the grave
reality the city faces from the economy and actions in Washington the executive budget and the May financial plan while
reflecting record high revenues adds nothing to the city's budget reserves or to its rainy day fund when adjusted for
prepayments spending budgeted for FY25 is $1.4 billion more than projected
revenues continuing a pattern of running a deficit for the third year in a row
the May plan also reflects larger outyear budget gaps than those projected by the mayor in January with no real
savings or efficiency program to address them and this is before accounting for the mayor's practice of underbudgeting
uh which we believe totals a whopping 4.05 05 billion in FY26 and 3.6 billion
on average in the out years uh when including the costs we know we're going to spend on rental assistance overtime
shelter Carter cases MTA subsidies and more some of those could be reduced with
good management others of them we're going to pay almost for certain none of them are reflected in this budget at a
time when the mayor should be preparing New York City for a potentially more constrained fiscal reality the May plan
in many ways remains just the opposite my office remains focused on protecting
New Yorkers and preparing for the challenges that may come given the great economic uncertainty and the risks with
the changes at the federal level present my office has gone ahead and prepared two economic and revenue forecasts one
that assumes we do not enter a recession and another that accounts for a mild recession in the no recession scenario
uh we project city revenues will exceed OM's estimates by 292 million this year
and 108 million next year in FY26 growing to 2.95 billion in 29 applying
the formula my office previously proposed to establish annual minimum deposits into the revenue stabilization
fund our rainy day fund this scenario would mean that would mean depositing 1.46 billion into the rainy day fund
this fiscal year in the case of a mild recession where higher tariffs persist
into 26 we rest estimate tax revenues would fall by 225 million in FY25 2.3
billion next year 2.12 billion in 27 uh before rebounding in 29 we would still
propose the formula would still you know support making a rainy day fund deposit
of $1.3 billion this year bringing the fund balance to 3.3 billion which could
then be used in FY26 and 27 if a recession transpires based on the
guidelines we've proposed i'm also again calling on the city to add $1 billion to
the general reserve in the FY26 budget as a protecting New York City reserve as
we brace for potentially devastating cuts not only to direct federal funding
but also to fally funded programs that keep millions of New Yorkers housed and fed these funds would be set aside and
could be deployed to mitigate the worst like the worst of the likely impacts um
already the federal government has announced cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars house Republicans have approved nearly $15 billion in New York
state cuts and cost shifts in health care and SNAP benefits alone uh together
if implemented all of that could easily translate to a $10 billion reduction in service for New York City residents not
only in but including and beyond the city budget um I'll give one other example of just a cut that's not in my
written testimony but that that reserve should be used for we already know they're eliminating 7,700 housing choice
vouchers um that's 7,700 families in New York City who will very likely be
homeless if we don't take action and yet to my knowledge the administration hasn't reached out to those families to
say "What's your circumstance what will you need to avoid being homeless?" or thought about whether city feeps uh
would be appropriate for some of them because if they wind up homeless then we are going to spend more on them than we
would if we did thoughtful planning those are the kinds of things that that extra billion dollars in the general
reserve would put us in a better position for in either economic scenario
my office estimates that budget gaps will be larger than those presented by OM in the no recession scenario we
project ending FY25 with a gap of 1.7 billion growing to 5.7 billion in 26 and
8.8 billion in FY29 um that's largely from higher spending estimates including the
deposits into the rainy day fund and general reserve in the recession scenario the FY25 gap would increase
modestly by 112 million to 1.87 billion uh if we then had rainy day fund
withdrawals of 1.6 billion in the subsequent 2 years the gaps would be 6.4
billion and 9.3 billion in 26 and 27 um
and now uh you know for the other part of my testimony I just want to turn to one issue uh that perhaps exemplifies
the mayor's disregard for this political moment and what it means for New York more than any other and that is
immigration the detention of Dylan a New York City public school student attending Ellis Prep in the Bronx
underscores what's at stake this is a young person who did everything right he followed all the rules showed up to
court as required and was still arrested by ICE agents outside the courthouse and
is now cycling through detention in other states and who knows where that's our New York City public school student
his case is a chilling reminder that even New Yorkers who play by the rules are vulnerable and need legal
representation it's why we must invest more in immigration legal services and
more creatively so no unaccompanied minor has to show up to immigration court alone that was the idea behind
knife up that's the idea behind right to counsel in housing court what this council has long wanted to do it is
critical to step it up now and so it's unconscionable that the mayor's budget does so little to protect immigrant New
Yorkers or shore up the dedicated legal service organizations working under increasingly challenging circumstances
to support them while the mayor has consistently failed to rightsize the resources for immigrant legal services
escalating anti-immigrant actions taken by the Trump administration and in too many cases aided by Mayor Adams make
these omissions in the executive budget all the more shameful but it's also a time for creativity people weren't going
to go to the asylum seeker application help center and they're hesitant to go to city or government offices so the
city the city should begin to fill the holes in immigrant legal services in this budget by including at least 7
million for IARE so immigrant kids like Dylan have access to attorneys that will ensure their cases have a fighting
chance um thanks to Musk and Doge who abruptly terminated federal contacts
funding legal representation for unaccompanied minors in removal proceedings more and more children are
facing deportation alone we should make sure that no kid in New York City has to
go to an ICE hearing or an immigration court hearing without a lawyer new York
City can afford to do that that will require partnership because it's the schools that know who and where they are
but has to make referrals to organizations that can provide it funding should also be allocated to
Restore Action NYC therefore in schools hospitals libraries uh community- based
organizations even in people's homes when they need it and to support Moya's immigrant rights workshops while I
commend the council for providing funding to keep the rapid response legal collaborative going full mayoral funding
should be restored to match the growing demand um we should also increase funding for the CCHR and DCWP to protect
working New Yorkers bolster resources for street vendors and include funding to support processing of permits and
increased outreach and education further I urge the speaker and the council to
increase the trans equity fund to $10 million using council discretionary funds and to work with the mayor to
increase funding for LGBTQ youth and young adult housing and ensure that New Yorkers can still access gender
affirming care despite potential changes in federal policy um uh let's see fi uh the city budget
must reflect our shared values and should not be used as a tool to further one executive's apparent desire to
collude with Trump but rather should be used to invest in our families and children and protect the most vulnerable
New Yorkers um but for one issue that I really have to underline unfortunately resources for DOE and 3K in particular
continue to be among the casualties of the mayor's perennial budget gains um although the May plan includes some
additional funding for 3K and preK we estimate that more than $150 million more is needed annually in FY26 to
sustain those programs at current levels um and meanwhile in a way that I think was a surprise to everyone uh the
executive budget uh doesn't reckon with the reality uh that's the state budget has left us around child care vouchers
um it's wonderful that we have tens of thousands of families now able to access access affordable care um uh while the
state encouraged the city to increase enrollment uh it did not make clear and it is now requiring that the city is
being hit with half the bill poor planning and communication on part of both the administration and the state
have led to families facing uncertainty the state appropriated an additional 350
million for the program but for state fiscal year 2026 only and at the same
time mandatorily increased the city's minimum contribution resulting in funding needs of at least $275 million
for the program in FY26 not reflected in the executive budget and growing to 625
million in future years unless additional funding is provided uh so I
urge uh the mayor and the speaker to go back to the state uh I know they've closed their budget but they closed
their budget in a way that opened challenges for us and we either need to find them in the city budget or get the
state to help because the answer cannot be to tell thousand thousands perhaps tens of thousands of families that they
won't be able to keep having their child care new York families need and deserve city leadership that's working toward a
vision of truly accessible universal child care not pointing fingers over the
shortcomings of the existing system um although the mayor has failed to articulate a plan to overcome the
funding gap this bud budget can and must take necessary steps to ensure that no
families currently receiving subsidies lose them the executive budget prepared
by the Adams administration for FY26 as I've outlined uh lacks even the most
basic elements to guard against the risks we now face uh we urge the council
as you engage in your negotiations with them in the coming month to set aside the critical reserves necessary to
protect the essential services that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable in our city you have fought that battle
many times in the past and I know you will work hard to do it over the next month thank you
thank you controller um I want to dive right into uh the report that your office published
back in April uh taking Trump's tariff seriously um you explored three
scenarios of federal policy changes i just want to dive into a little bit um out of the three scenarios which do you
believe is the most likely for the country and which you believe is the most likely for the city um I'll say a
couple of words and then turn it over to uh Franchesco and Christa who worked on this report and obviously I mean it's
you know like we live in such an era of uncertainty even yesterday with the court rulings the tariffs are on the
tariffs are off how do you decide which is the most likely to come in here and present so what we chose to do in this
report and today is present you two scenarios mild recession and no recession um in the report we issued we
thought mild recession was most likely because the tariffs that seem likely to remain regardless uh will really have
economic impacts um uh but it just feels like a roll of the dice and that's why
we really urge putting the resources in reserves we don't know what the courts are going to rule we don't know what Trump is going to do in relationship to
China it might be a tariff scenario that causes a recession and perhaps the
tariffs won't happen he'll claim it was some kind of win and roll them back and the economy will be better we'll still
be glad we have the reserves in that scenario and I'll turn it over which taxes do you think would be most acutely
affected under either scenario i mean um I guess
I couldn't have said it better than the controller about you know um what's going to happen i think we've taken out
the the deeper recession scenario from this report um we consider that risk
lower than than than a recession it's hard to pick between you know the the
two uh you know slow growth versus mild recession at this point but uh the first
taxes that will be affected are the nonprop everything but the property tax we know that the property tax is you
know it's got internal stabilizers and and averaging so that's not the one that uh reflects current economic conditions
but all of the others PIT sales uh hotel uh business taxes would would be
affected okay i asked uh OMB the same question they didn't really have a great
answer um Standard and Poor's most recent reading of the city's general obligation bonds notes that the city has
large financial reserves of almost 11.4 billion at the end of SY24
s SNP looks at both the city reserve accounts and the surplus budget role at the end of the fiscal year uh while S&P
notes that this level is large reserves nonetheless have been declining since they peaked in FY22 uh they were at 12.7
billion at the end of FY22 12.3 billion at the end of FY23 and 11.4 billion at
the end of FY24 i think OM said they think it'd be around that same amount
this year do you agree with that or do you think I guess the question is what level of financial reserves does it look
like we'll be reaching by the end of FY25
okay there is still a little bit of disagreement regarding you know what the tax revenues are going to be for this
year so you know the ball is still rolling but based on the executive budget um the the city is uh putting in the
budget stabilization account which I I understand that standard imports count as a reserve uh one and a half billion
more or less less than it did in FY24 right uh so by that account and without
changing the other reserves the the FY25 reserves at the end of the year as
calculated by S&P should be lower by about 1 and a.5 billion
we do feel strongly though just as like a matter of budgeting you can't count something as a reserve that you are also
counting for spending next year so I mean what you're rolling into next year's budget it it isn't a reserve
because you call it one that is a role and um besides being a way to protect
city services during a downturn uh reserves may be able to help us lower the effective cost of our capital
projects and their ratings of the city's general obligation bonds moody's noted that stronger reserves including
deposits to the revenue stabilization fund would lead to a ratings increase so how much additional deposits into the
reserves do you think would be necessary to affectuate a ratings increase
you're acting as though they're you know like us as opposed to like the oracle at
Deli right um I don't think that even Moody's would be
able to tell you right i I think it's important and that's not just Moody's but Croll and other uh and all of the
rating agencies really they're saying if you have a rule if you have a policy that you know sort of tells you when
you're going to deposit and you know under what conditions you're going to withdraw and and you know and that's a
policy that is being implemented that's a credit positive right um you know as a general matter uh the
US credit is AA1 the TFA credit is A1 the geo credit is AA2 I And you know
it's um I would say that uh better reserve
policy would help i don't know to what extent the rating agencies would you know go from there to increasing the the
rating but increasing the city's bond rating would save the city in lower debt service costs right it would other other
things equal uh you know what we pay is depends on uh you know how our credit is seen and how much we issue right the you
know we've issuing we've been issuing a lot of debt right the more you the more you issue you know the the more
compensation investors are going to ask for okay I want to ask about the Manhattan class A office vacancy rate of
the many notable lagging impacts of the pandemic one area that continues to show little or no improvement is the demand
for office space uh Kushman and Wakefield reported uh 22.7% of all
Manhattan class A office space still remains vacant as of the end of FY Y25
uh Q3 we asked OM about the uh we asked OM earlier about the number of
applications that the city has received so far specifically for the office to residential conversion so are you able
to speak uh to any of the details regarding the progress on these conversions
yes so we don't have access to the accelerators data um we have done some
research we have um estimated a pipeline of about uh 44 buildings that would
conver convert to residential this is a mixture of rental and condos um that is
probably uh we estimate 15 million square ft of uh of office space of which
about 12 million could access the tax incentives in the short term um so
that's about we estimate you know if you take a look at the decline in occupancy for class B and C the ones that and and
the ones that are not Hudson Yards and the like if you look at the decline in occupancy this could um absorb about a
third of the loss so it's that Do you want to direct them to this chart in the where is this in the report this is a
secret chart oh sorry top secret chart that that will be published i see we
will be sharing this information shortly but it's not yet in your book i always have a report for that what What impacts
do you think um the the commercial to residential conversions would have on
the city's tax role um most so most of the these conversions
are going to be converted to rentals and we believe most of them are going to take advantage of the 467mm
uh tax exemptions most of the space is in Manhattan um so what what happens now
is that this buildings are being taxed as office and they're paying something and then that amount of tax is going to
drop to whatever is the 10% of the valuation that DOF um is going to put on
this building so um you know preliminarily in the secret report that soon will be uh published uh we we put
the price of this 12 million square ft in present value at about $5 billion uh
in terms of you know the the tax expenditures that that are associated with these buildings so it's more a
measure of it's more a program that stabilizes the market and puts it on an
a more even kill than generating tax revenues though you know we're going to
lose tax revenues in part because we are buying affordability and and in in substantial amounts I would say um
and in Manhattan where other programs are not able to produce um housing or
affordable housing so in a crypto event that the mayor attended in Las Vegas earlier this
week he announced to our surprise New York City would issue bit bonds has the
Did the administration give you a heads up before they announced this great idea we we were we read about it in the paper
as well and were as surprised as you perhaps more surprised since we partner with them on the issuance of bonds and
uh yes there there we will not be uh partnering in the issuing of any
bitcoinbacked bonds um in on my watch as controller and and is that because the
asset class is just renowned for chaos and fluctuation yes and it is renowned
for chaos and fluctuation and it probably does not comply with the city's
bond issuance criteria what you know there are folks around the country who do use bonds for expenses but New York
City famously does not do that got in a lot of trouble during the fiscal crisis doing it so we only use our bonds for
capital assets uh and directive 10 does not identify Bitcoin as a capital asset
and that's actually I mean a Bitcoinbacked bond has as I understand it and I'm not an expert in this but 10%
of it is used to purchase Bitcoin to purchase cryptocurrency which just on
its face would not be compliant with directive 10 and the city's rules for bond issuance so besides being a a wacky
idea so what what was our mayor thinking that's dangerous to speculate
on i mean I we asked OM and they had it wasn't like he let them know he was
going to bring this up no you know I mean yes I I think it was you know look and I this is serious you
know like we it's it's I guess it was reported that taxpayers paid for the trip to Vegas i think it's probably
worth looking at like all those expenses which ones were paid by taxpayers and which ones if any were paid by the
Bitcoin organizers of the conference either way it's highly problematic should not be taxpayer dollars spending
for him to go to Vegas but it also should not be that like Bitcoin bros are
paying for the mayor to go on a a marketing trip um so whether he had
some obligations as a result of who paid for the trip or whether he genuinely
believes it would be a good idea it is really quite unacceptable either way
okay thank you controller uh we've been joined by council members Sanchez Williams and Hudson and we've got
questions from Council Member Brewer thank you very much um as chair of oversight and investigations I'm always
trying to make sure there's enough money for oversight agencies and we asked about uh DOI and we uh asked about the
IG at the uh Department of Education which apparently is so underfunded but
never asked for funding you got CCRB you have um I'm sure that uh Council Member
Williams will talk about um uh human rights etc there's a lot of them so my question to you is do you is that
something that you look at in terms of their funding i always think that there's just not enough investigators or
attorneys in these oversight agencies well one thing I'll point to is we do
now have a really good uh tracker on our website of headcount so one thing you
can very easily see on a real time basis is what budgeted headcount agency was in
the past what it is currently and what actual headcount in those agencies is so
it's a really easy way to look at the city the commission on human rights or uh any of the others and see how much
down are they from where they used to be and also how many people do they really have because in many cases there's big
gaps even between budget headcount and actual um we've looked I'm trying to think we've looked at a few of the
agencies i don't know that we've done an oversight recently um I'll give you one example though as
an oversight agency ourselves of a place where we could use uh some resources you
know one thing that we do is settle claims against the city um and it turns
out the software we're using for that is like in cobalt it's 30 years old we
could be identifying patterns much better of harm being caused that we could actually reduce claims if we're
able to modernize so we have an RFP out right now uh for new software system for
claims adjustments we have to wait for that to come back but you know that's one more area that I think the city
could do we could be doing much more effective oversight it's about $2 billion we spent last year on claims
against the city in an area where there's just a a lot less scrutiny than we should have well that would be a
place where DOI could make a difference if it had the uh adequate staffing
agreed next is I always ask um IBO but this unpaid uh dollars the ones that
don't get collected um a few years ago when I asked IBO was 2.1 billion is that
something that you look at i always get told "Oh it can never be collected." But it's very frustrating for those of us
who do pay our taxes to see uh those that don't is that something that you look at is that something that we should
be looking at um well the 2.1 billion um has several
components right uh it's got the ECB uh u return to oath um summones um and
adjudication uh has got uh property tax um delinquencies and it had unpaid you
know uh uh speed tickets and and red light tickets right uh in part that number was affected by what happened
during the pandemic and the enforcement during the pandemic so some of those you know red light tickets of you know that
were outstanding have coming down there is a lean sales schedule for June 3rd um
at this point so part of that you know is is being addressed I mean we did an audit about the uh the red light cameras
right and and the speed cameras you know that those are still outstanding issues um the ECB debt is many of those um
entities are not in existence anymore and there is no nothing that we can go that the city can go after that and you
know the the department of finance often does well sometime at times does amnesties right and and people come
forth but it's not like they generate a huge amount of money right they generate 40 60 million right uh so that's in part
that's a reflection of the fact that you know a lot of that money is notional and it's in the books rather than being real
okay i'm going to actually say one thing that sort of builds from that that's um since this is my you know will be my uh
my last year as controller for future council oversight work and and others
potential uh future work in the controllers's office or elsewhere um no one has probably done more than
Franchesco to pay attention to the quality of our estimates for what the
city is owed and what the city owes at the end of a year and some of that is
you know things like speeding tickets but some of that is you know we've still got outstanding contracts and obviously
if we're 10 months or a year late in paying often we don't really know you know what they're going to actually
invoice us for um the same is there's similar challenges collecting on federal
contracts my goodness this year when we end the fiscal year how we estimate what
the federal government owes us and is likely to pay us is uh is going to present challenges so um I'm proud of
the work that my team has done in the Bureau of Accountancy under uh Franchesco's leadership but that is an
area that needs real attention from the next New York City controller and from
oversight sounds like oversight and investigations the city council as well
yes thank you um the other quick question is just in terms of um vacancies um I know that we're ongoing i
think what you're should say is we should just look at your data in terms of where all the how we can address the
vacancy issues it's two for one it's can't hire it's it's a whole lot of different things is there any one aspect
of that that you would think we should be focused on in terms of the number of vacancies it's going down but it still
exists yeah um so we did you know create that dashboard so you could see it and
then we periodically try to take a look at where we think an MMR indic there's a
mismatch between an MMR indicator and headcount and it doesn't look to me like
there is a process by which OM does that you can say by forcing us to slow roll
hiring here you're costing us more money because those those housing units are
vacant and the families are still in homeless shelters um but that does not seem to be um available and also you
looked at overtime do you have any recommendations on that for next year um
I mean uh you know on NYPD in particular you know we're about 1500 officers below
budgeted headcount 35,000 headcount 335 that number is going down because in 2005 there was a very big NYPD
recruitment class those folks are hitting their 20 and so I suspect that by the end of this year that number
could be two and even 3,000 officers and obviously the more you are below budgeted headcount the more you wind up
spending on overtime the commissioner has changed the academic credentials needed and that thinks she thinks
that'll help apparently it really jumped up the applications good or bad I don't know but it's helps with recruitment i
don't know if it helps with intelligence one thing that I've uh was suggested to me by the prior chief of department Ken
Corey was to look at expanding the NYPD cadet program that program is great but
it you have to right now already have 45 credits so if you're a person who's got
45 college credits you can apply for the NYPD cadet program become a cadet
they'll start paying you know a good share of your tuition while you work your way towards your BA he's
recommended opening it up to kids out of high school so you don't have to have any college credits that you could
enroll in the cadet program become a cadet they could pay we could the city could pay your tuition till you get your
associates and then you take the test and come on to the force in a more streamlined way and that I think would
address I mean obviously for a while they would be cadets and not officers but would really help with recruitment
but it has been shown over and over again that officers who do get some college education you know college
degree like anybody else just you know mature and benefit from it thank you
um I wanted to ask in your testimony you mentioned that the city needs to add 150 million for 3K and in the FY26 budget
can you elaborate on that yes we were comparing uh what the city
spent last year for 3K and preK um compared to what they currently have
budgeted for this year and next year um and then the so the shortfalls are as
mentioned um so we are assuming that the city needs at least what they spent last year they did add significant funding
but that was primarily to address um e like the special education prek seats
that they had funded for one year only they put in money to baseline those funds um and some other initiatives like
that um but they haven't addressed kind of this general underbudgeting issue um
that's coming okay
thank you all very much appreciate your testimony thank you thank
you okay we'll take a break 2:30 at 2:30 we will hear from the
Department of Finance thank you
[Music] okay good afternoon everyone welcome to
the third portion of today's uh the 13th and final day of executive budget hearings i'm Council Member Brandon i
chair the Committee on Finance welcome to Commissioner Preston Ninlack and your team thank you all for joining us today
to answer our questions uh my questions will largely focus on new needs uh lean
sale reform and business tax warrants uh just as a reminder only written testimony will be admitted for today's
hearing we're not doing any public testimony today if you wish to submit written testimony for the record you can
email it to testimony@counsel.nyc.gov anytime up to
72 hours after the conclusion of today's hearing i'm now going to turn it over to
my committee council Brian Saro to swear everyone in and we can get started uh
just noting we've been joined by council members Williams Brewer Sanchez and
Hudson good afternoon do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this
committee and to respond honestly to council member questions commissioner
Neblack yes first Deputy Sheer I do and
Deputy Commissioner James i do you may begin
okay thank you good afternoon Chair Brandon members of the committee and members of the council my name is
Preston Nibl and I'm the commissioner of the New York City Department of Finance i'm joined by First Deputy Commissioner
Jeffrey Shear and Jacqueline James our chief financial officer and deputy commissioner for administration and
planning thank you for the opportunity to testify today on our fiscal year 2026
executive budget now more than ever before the Department of Finance remains steadfast in our commitment to
administer the city's tax laws and to perform our other responsibilities fairly effectively and with our
customers New Yorkers squarely in mind at all times before discussing the AY's
executive budget for the coming year I would like to touch on a few updates including our progress on the tax lean sale the recent banking commission
meetings and the release of the city's final property assessment role
as you know we extended the deadline for owners to act to remove their properties from the lean sale by two weeks from May
19th to June 2nd to ensure that our outreach especially for class one homeowners would be
comprehensive this year's tax lean sale is the first in four years which meant that there was a larger atrisisk pool
than is typical but as part of the reforms we enacted last year together the city has engaged in the most
extensive outreach we have ever undertaken in connection with the lean sale with the help of our partners at
the Department of Environmental Protection the Mayor's Public Engagement Unit Housing Preservation and
Development and the Center for New York City Neighborhoods and their community partners we've knocked on over 6,500
doors made over 70,000 calls sent 100,000 postcards and held 57 in-person
outreach events in conjunction with 37 elected officials mostly council members
we extend our appreciation to all of you who assisted in hosting these events this Monday will be the last day for
owners to act so we urge any property owner who has not yet responded to a lean sale notice to please visit our
website nyc.gov/leansale or visit us in person at one of our five burough business
centers we appreciate the council's partnership and are here to assist your constituents
turning to the banking commission every May the banking commission meets to authorize the banking institutions that
the city of New York will use to safeguard the city's deposits and provide banking services for city
agencies although this process doesn't necessarily garner a lot of attention the security of the city's money is our
highest priority so we undertake a painstakingly thorough process to ensure the selection of banks capable of this
responsibility this year I'm pleased to report that 32 banking institutions were designated
including two new community banks Pon Bank which was formerly a community development financial institution and
Rididgewood Savings finally another annual event in the month of May is the release of the
final property assessment role which was published just this last Tuesday the role showed a solid year for real estate
in New York City with the overall market value of properties increasing by 5.39% and taxable billable assessed
value up 3.03% as usual the final assessment role was slightly lower than the tenative
role released in January down by 0.28% due to administrative reviews by DOF and
tax commission decisions owners can expect to receive their first quarter property tax bill
based on the final role in the second week of June so now let me turn to the executive
budget the DOF executive budget for fiscal year 2026 is 365.2 million our budget for the coming
year includes important strategic investments that will allow the agency to take meaningful steps forward in
accomplishing our important mission excuse me there are two pivotal
investments I'd like to specifically highlight first is an acrosstheboard adjustment in the pay scale for our city
tax auditors this measure is designed to both make us more competitive in the hiring of new entry- level auditors as
well as to improve our retention of more experienced senior auditors our tax auditors deserve a career path where
they can grow learn acquire experience and take on more complex cases and
supervisory responsibilities and be appropriately rewarded for their work all within the Department of Finance
this initiative is a big step toward making that a reality second as many of you know the
Department of Finance operates the Parking Violations Bureau which handles all 16 million parking and speed camera
violations that are issued each year in the city this operation currently relies on
a 40-year-old mainframe computer system which frankly has seen better days this is why we're investing in a
comprehensive new system that will bring our processes into the 21st century enhancements will allow us to improve
the efficiency of our hearings reduce turnaround time for decisions and allow
commercial fleet operators to electronically enroll in our fleet programs among other improvements
ultimately this investment will allow us to be more adaptive and agile to new public safety measures and to improve
the customer experience we've just kicked off the procurement for the multi-year process needed to replace the
current system we expect work to start in the early fall and to take two to three years to complete and we look
forward to keeping the council informed as we deliver this crucial upgrade in closing the Department of
Finance continues our steady yet crucial role of collecting and protecting the city's money this is my fourth year
joining you all as the commissioner for these budget hearings and I can confidently say that this is the best I
have felt as we continue to prepare for the future sadly Mr chairman this is our
last budget hearing together i've appreciated your partnership and support and that of the staff of the finance
division led by Richard Lee Emma Adv Michael Sherman and Jack Story in
particular who've all been tremendously uh uh cooperative and helpful and great to work
with thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify today and I'm
happy to take your questions thank you Commissioner um so the FY26 budget includes a million
dollars in new needs in FY25 and 6.7 million in
FY26 and increasing amounts in the outy years these new needs will fund upgrades to uh the summons tracking account
receivable system stars as well as uh a pay increase to city tax auditors and uh
the ATAS administrative tax auditors can you provide a breakdown of the improvements that will be made to stars
as well as detail the last time those systems were improved or updated
yes absolutely so from from time to time we we we make changes to the existing
SAR system to reflect uh new types or amounts of violations or other changes in the law so part of the funding is for
that for the ongoing maintenance of the current system the bulk of the funding here is for the replacement system that
I talked about which we are calling internally parking 2.0 uh and
uh the the challenge with the current system is really it's you know we lack
people who any longer who people are not trained right now in the programming language that it runs on so we have to
maintain a special uh consulting group just to work on it it's costly we were
exploring to give you one example we explored uh earlier this year uh what it
would take to write tickets against vehicle identification numbers in lie of or in addition to license plates and it
was going to cost don't quote me although I know I'm on the record here but something like $2 million and take
18 months just to make this change so that it really illustrates kind of the rigidity and the and the superanuation
of the of the current system so the bulk of the funding here is really to allow us to replace that system with a new
upgraded modern architecture and system are there are there going to be any other costs uh additional costs of
running the new system once it's fully upgraded uh you know it's going to cost some amount to operate continue to
operate uh and I don't know that we know right now what uh exactly that cost is
going to be um our goal here is to be able to lower the contract cost and to
do more of the work uh inhouse uh with our own IT staff and uh ultimately to
reduce the ongoing operating costs which right now are are very high
okay uh talk about auditors the executive budget includes uh about
$935,000 in FY25 3.7 in FY26 and the outy years uh
for the auditor paycale adjustment how much is the adjustment per auditor per year and is the pay scale adjustment
uniform across all titles well we're we're setting a new salary
schedule uh for each level so we have four we have four levels of city tax auditor one through four as well as a
group chief designation and then we have four levels of administrative tax auditor um we have setting a new scale
for every each one of those titles uh again with the goal of uh both
attracting more talent new talent as well as retaining the experienced auditors that we have um what's what's
the retention rate of auditors uh the the retention rate in in the first I
would say two years we lose something like 30 to 40% of our tax auditors and
we've become a bit of a training ground frankly for for accounting firms across the city so people come into uh the city
tax auditor positions at DOF they get some experience they become you know
valuable to other uh outside private sector firms and they get hired away at at better salaries so part of our goal
here is to make it more attractive and competitive to come to Dolphin to stay at Dolphin i wish city hall would do the
same thing for EMS and FDNY um how many applications does the DOF receive in
FY24 for the role of city tax auditor
um city tax auditor is a it's a civil service position so the process is is
that there's a list people take an exam there's a list that's established when we need to hire we have to call the list
which means we have to contact every person who's on the list and essentially invite them to a hiring hall um I'll
have to get back to you with exactly how many people showed up at the hiring hall in the past year we've hired 54 auditors
we have a new uh uh we have a sorry upcoming hiring hall in July with about
60 vacancies to fill um so you know we
have so far been successful at filling our vacancies for the most part when we've held hiring halls uh the retention
continues to be a little bit of an issue but um hopefully it's honestly slowed
down a little bit uh with the new federal administration um and we've
actually been able to hire back about a dozen or so auditors senior especially senior auditors who had left to go to
the IRS who now coming back to to the department of finance who we welcome
with open arms the office of tax enforcement that's the sheriff
no the office of tax enforcement is part of the a division of
audit excuse me division of audit and tax enforcement uh it's
essentially I it's essentially when there are audit cases that reveal evidence of criminal uh possible
criminal fraud then they get referred to the office of tax enforcement they also do their own uh investigations and
enforcement activities um more recently they have been quite involved with
operation padlock to protect as part of the sheriff's joint task force okay is that why they've gone uh over their
budgeted overtime amount by 2,000% yes the the the
the nature of the inspections on the task force has been that they are
um frequently involve overtime yes when they've been we've been sending tax enforce in addition to their regular
duties we've been sending them out uh to participate in those and often you end
up working past your normal scheduled shift if you've made an arrest or if you're in the process of processing
evidence after an inspection uh or you know things of that nature in FY24 the
Office of Tax Enforcement was budgeted at $32,586 at adoption they ended up
spending $74,72
yes okay how do we not do that again well I
think as we slow down with the uh I mean is it a headcount issue it is slight It
is partly a headcount issue it's a small staff what's the current What's the current budgeted and actual headcount
for the sheriff's department i'm going to turn well for the sheriff's department or I'm confused this is not
this is separate these guys are raiding illegal weed shops but they're not the sheriff the the office of tax
enforcement has been part of the uh the sheriff's joint compliance task force in
Operation Padlock to Protect yes okay so what what is the issue there
that they're going over their overtime by over 2,000% again I mean it it's
they're participating in the task force and the nature of the inspections uh that are conducted uh of the illicit pot
shops under operation padlock to protect is that if you are there you've you've
inspected a shop you're seizing evidence you've made an arrest etc you're going to finish the job even if it means that
you're there past your normal shift time so you're going to incur overtime given the pace of activity in the last year
especially in the first uh nine months let's say of the of the operation
padlock to protect um there was a lot of overtime incurred now as operation
padlock protect sort of winds down and we've we've closed as you know something like,400 shops um as the pace of
operations there slows down somewhat we don't necessarily expect to see those same levels of overtime going forward
i did want to if I may go back to one previous question we had uh 149
applicants candidates uh on the civil service list for city tax auditor of which we hired 54 i
think this is OT yeah the current active headcount in the office of tax
enforcement is 13 and their authorized headcount is 23 so they're they're down
in staff so that's also part of why we've
had uh some overtime how much revenue did do receive as a result of civil
forfeite following marijuana shop uh inspections in FY24 so I I'm going to
turn to uh Deputy Commissioner James to answer that question i'm sorry the civil
forfeite from the We don't we don't actually get any civil forfeite money
there's no civil for the civil forfeite program is a Mhm district Attorney uh
program who cuts the money nypd well it's it's really a district attorney program i don't know do you
So civil the civil the civil service
funding comes from the state it's a joint investigation that the sheriff
does with the district attorney they didn't have to demonstrate that they successfully got um revenues from
whatever raid that they did and then the department of the sheriff's office receives a portion of that so it's a
it's a more indepth process that happens when it comes whatever they whatever
they do get what do they do with the money have we have we receive I don't think we've received we've receive some funding and we have it in our budget and
it is used to spend on the sheriff's initiatives so currently I think we spent like
$118,000 so far on I forgot if it's radios we purchased or some other
equipments that we purchased for the sheriff's office but it has to be spent on the sheriff's initiatives
It's not it's not a huge amount of money that we've received we'll come back to you with the more complete detailed
answer okay uh in the November 23 plan DOF had
a peg for increased tax audit revenue which was projected to provide $24
million in additional revenue for FY24 and 48.7 in FY25 in the out years
this would be accomplished through the hiring of 45 additional staff um can you
provide us with an update on the uh impact of that peg if it worked it has i
think we've hired uh we we have currently of those positions filled we have 45 staff uh that was allocated to
us um and we have 31 of those currently filled um we have increased our audit
target since the beginning of the year and just most recently in the executive plan uh we recognized roughly about
deputy commissioner shift for $50 million 50 roughly $50 million in
additional audit revenue and it's now baked in that that increase is now baked into our baseline
audit projection okay uh the November 23 plan DOF had a
peg for increased tax revenue due to the removal of ineligible co-op and condo
abatement uh recipients this peg projected 7.5 million in additional tax
revenue could you tell us about that yes how much tax revenue was collected
as a result of that peg we've been um excuse me uh meeting our additional
revenue targets there in fact last year we collected uh I believe $10 million i
guess 7.5 i'm sorry Jack i'll let Jack answer this question so for our revenue target for fiscal 23 our target for 23
was 1.2 million we collected $1.3 million in tax audit revenues in fiscal
24 our target is $968 million and so far we are I'm sorry
our target is 747 million and so far we're on target for 968 that was 24 in fiscal 25 our
target is 8.25 and we've already collected $710 million how many more
ineligible apartment abatement recipients do you think there are
is there is there a burrow or a neighborhood that has higher than average rates i think Bay Ridge is really
um I don't I mean part of the we did the our tax policy group did a
review and they sort of categorized uh people at sort of levels of likelihood so for example somebody who
was receiving a co-op and condo abatement an address in the city but who was filing their tax return for the last
two years from another address outside of the city you know those people overwhelmingly
uh did not respond or actually fessed up and said "Yeah I don't actually live there." So they're uh abments were
revoked um the sort of now we're we're kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel a
little bit more and a little bit lower likelihood uh people but we continue to
do this exercise and review this uh regularly every year or every other year
to ensure that we're sort of capturing on a regular ongoing basis uh the
universe of people who may not be eligible for uh the abatement so we
heard from some constituents that they only had like a week to reply to a removal
do you want to answer that one sure okay what happens if a correction comes in after the deadline yes so we give
unit owners 30 days to respond so so not a week if um you have specific
complaints um please refer them to us so that we can review Um if mistakes were
made by us in processing we will fix them right um including if they were
made after the deadline okay um let's talk about the lean sale uh the
initial list of properties that were at risk of having their leans sold totals nearly 1.6 billion uh since then the
most recent data that we received at the council shows that amount has shrunk to about 675 million it's a change of
slightly more than $900 million of that 900 million how much in tax revenue was
actually collected so far so as you know there's a combination when when leans are removed from the
from the initial 90-day list before the sale was for a combination of reasons uh
it could include people come in and pay uh people enter a payment plan or they
turn out not to be uh they shouldn't have been on the list because they received an exemption or they they filed
an easy exit application or they you know there was some other uh error or reason why they shouldn't have been on
the list so I don't we don't have solid numbers yet we will know better numbers
by the middle of June a couple weeks after we after the final date um and I'm
more than happy to supply and update it uh for you as soon as we have those numbers so and since this is the first
lean sale in years and there's a lot more properties than we typically see um
and we've thankfully had additional funds to do greater outreach it's inevitable that some properties that
some owners will fall through the cracks so what does DOF what will DOF do if we find out after a lean is sold that a
property had deed fraud or uh tangled title issues uh any any property
that even once the lean is sold if they come to us and they say "Hey I'm in probate hey there's a dispute over the
ownership etc." We will defect that lean and we'll take the lean out okay
um I want to ask I'm asking everybody today um if you were notified about the
bit bonds before the mayor announced it in Las Vegas yes I heard about it but
you didn't he didn't tell you about it before he did i spoke with him about it before and what do you think of the idea
you know we're we're it's it's a as I said to the mayor at the time it's on the edge of sort of our experience here
and so it deserves a very thorough study um and I know that this is really OM's
world along with the controller uh so it's really on uh on those two
entities now to review this proposal and try and understand exactly what it is
that the benefits that we would get from it um and proceed obviously we have a
pretty rigorous uh framework in which we operate for issuing bonds and we have a excellent
you know credit and we don't want to harm that at all and I'm sure that there will be 100% due diligence done to
ensure that that's protected the controller mentioned that he didn't think that bit bonds would comply with
directive 10 he's he's better positioned to know that than I am so okay we I mean we believe
that crypto and bitcoins and all this nonsense is the asset class is
just infamous for chaos and uncertainty and uh you know volatility we we don't
believe that the city should be have anything to do with Bitcoin or crypto i watched earlier and I I registered
your opinion on that okay uh we have questions now from council member Williams followed by Brewer thank you
thank you hello budget equity is really important to me um not just how we spend money but also how we generate money as
a city and property taxes I know is like a thing and it's been a thing for a very
long time before I even got here um and in conversations with the state they say the city the city is supposed to tell
them what they're supposed to do upwards of speaker hasty in conversations with the city the conversation isn't always
clear um I'm sure you're watching the litigation happening with the lawsuit
with the Tenny Group um and just wondering um has your office uh done any
assessments or thought of new methodologies to make the property tax
system a little bit more equitable in New York City so as you know thank you for that
question as you know we uh the not we but the previous administration uh Mayor
Delasio and Speaker Johnson put together a advisory commission who made
recommendations uh we worked on legislation that would uh essentially
translate those into re you know deep reforms to the property tax system the
the problem with an overhaul that was that sweeping is there was a lot of disruption to taxpayers and there were
taxpayers who would have seen their bills double or triple and there were taxpayers who would have benefited but
it was a lot of change so you know we're looking now at sort taking a step back
but our goals remain the same which is to move us in the direction of greater equity to sort of to get rid of the
sources of the complaint really in the in the lawsuit uh and also to introduce
uh benefits income based benefits broadly that don't exist now i mean you
can certainly get a senior citizen home homeowner exemption or disabled homeowner exemption but if you're a
family raising if you're raising a young family and you're you know trying to buy a home the property taxes uh you don't
get any benefit right now we'd like to be able to change that and ensure that people get some benefit uh for low and
moderate income households so that they can stay in their homes or buy homes so that's the thrust of you know our
reforms uh that we're looking at
do you agree with them that New York City has the power and jurisdiction to
reform the property taxes without state intervention no uh the the basic
framework for the property tax system is set in the real property state real
property tax law so there's you know that absolutely requires the legislature to act there are very limited um powers
that we have locally uh so you know you the city council obviously can set the rates every year we uh at the department
of finance can set the assessment ratio but there's no you know there's very limited uh scope that we have for uh
making any kind of changes uh more substantively thank you um and the last question which
is very broad but I'm going to go for it um your office assesses fines for
different types of things um do you ever assess whether or not you are um finding
certain communities over other ones so in general I'm I'm going to draw a
distinction we don't ass we don't issue violations or fines uh for I mean we
will for non-payment of taxes or that kind of thing but in terms of other ECB
type violations or whatever that parking ticket etc we don't uh issue the
violations we are just in charge of collecting um I am very mindful of uh
efforts uh our collection efforts and how they are focused um we don't you
know for example in our audit process we're not interested in going after small taxpayers we're interested in going after larger taxpayers who may you
know be um not fully complying with the law uh
uh at a scale that's actually you know makes some sense for us to pursue i'm not going after someone who you know
made a small error and underpaid by $100 um as I say I think you know we're
in the property tax realm we're very constrained by state law and we really would like to we think it the best
approach here would be to change the state law in order to provide uh more tax relief to low and moderate income
homeowners um so there again it's like that's that's not fully within our hands
to change unilaterally it's not at all within our hands to change unilaterally but we want to uh work with the legislature and with you all to enact
reforms that would be beneficial we think to communities that have historically may have been overt taxed
thank you and yes I appreciate that distinction but on your end do you get
the data around where these fines are occurring and you did mention auditing so do you audit for
that so like a parking ticket like No okay no we I mean we we have information
because I know it's an enforcement side and there's probably a conversation to be had with the UIPD as an example but
you you are also kind of collecting the money yep and so wondering if you do do
any audits to determine whether or not these fines are equitably dispersed
amongst all New Yorkers i I think we have information regarding parking
tickets uh at the uh council district level let me let uh first deputy
commissioner we have information on on parking tickets at the police precinct
level oh okay um we don't have information since it is
parking tickets um we don't know the income of the motorists for example um
who have received the tickets we don't um but you know the community right so
would you and do you do you ever make those type of assessments when you have the data do you ever look and say like
"Oh I see that in council member Brewer's district we
collected x amount of dollars and in I don't know council member Steven's
district we collected x amount of dollars." Like do you look at that and
say do you make any assessments do you look at that data uh we don't routinely
do that um no we don't routinely do that mostly because it's it
It's actually the data is somewhat hard to collect that way for us so it's a bit of an effort uh but we have you know we
have the ability to do that to some extent and I can come back to you with you know some thoughts do that if I'll also say that I
know I live in council member Brewer's district and a lot more tickets could be written there i would love I would love
if we could continue this conversation because I do think it's important as a city again we want to spend our money in
equitable fashion across the burrows across communities across different demographics but I think it's also
equally important to look at how we are collecting money as well understood thank you
you mentioned um you're working on another version of uh the property tax
reform do you have a timeline of when you'd share that with the council well our goal immediately was to we we
were seeking to introduce legislation after the budget was finalized which obviously took five weeks longer than it
was supposed to um the uh our goal right now is to see if we can get a a bill
introduced this session in order to sort of put a marker down here that we are uh
pursuing reform that is going to be the beginning of a conversation whatever we put forward we know is not what's going to
get passed so our our goal here is once we get the legislation introduced then
we intend to start shopping around much more seriously and having much more
serious conversations with people about the content of the legislation um I'm not sure it's worth the effort if the
bill's never introduced at this point but you know we're happy to talk to you about it uh whatever whatever happens in Alb
we're happy to talk to you about it council member Brewer thank you first of all as I always say thank you Rita Jen
for coming to the office to talk about scree and dre it makes a huge difference i really appreciate it um along those
lines there's I don't think it's happened in Albany yet but there are some changes hopefully with CPI screed
is that something that the administration supports in Albany or you haven't taken a position i would defer
to OMB on that okay number two is I should know this but the new red light cameras speed cameras does that
information go to finance as to how many tickets are collected or does it just go the money just go to OM for red light
camera violations yes yeah it's all recorded in stars we know that okay and is it working in other words are you
getting more funding for it and are the numbers up uh you know we published a
report every year about this which I don't have in front of me what I I think I recall is that in fact red light
camera violations worked in the sense that the number of violations has started to go
down that's a good thing yeah uh but I don't have the numbers in front of me but I'll send you speed also speed um
the other thing of the ghost plates it's not just ghost plates people order plates online people from Virginia seem
to have lots of plates and people who live here uh move from another state and never get their New York state license
plate so is that's how are we addressing any of that i know it's not just you it's PD but the money we're losing
millions I would assume even just telling people maybe that's the Department of Motor Vehicles you live
here you're supposed to have a New York State license but again when they go through the cameras everywhere and get
the tickets they're not paying yeah how are we addressing that if at all very difficult honestly to address the ghost
plates particularly because again they they may not we may not have anybody on you know was associated with that issue
a ticket to right we we encounter increasingly we have encountered the
problem of people who um somebody somebody stole the plate
somebody defaced the plate so that it looks like a different plate somebody didn't take the registration sticker off
correct when they sold their car so the license the violation gets issued to the wrong owner we set up a program in the
office of the parking summons advocate where if you get five or more violations
like that that are dismissed by an ALJ then we will actually you can sign a form and we will dispute those tickets
for you as they come in so that you don't have to be dealing with them because there are cases where we've had
dozens even hundreds of tickets issued uh to a vehicle that didn't belong anymore to the owner so you know there's
uh there is definitely an issue with you know how are we recording with the DMV
correct ownership but a lot of this you know especially with def defaced or
ghost plates is very difficult to really tackle all right but I'm just All right
so we're kind of like chalking it up to can't do anything about it i I don't I
wouldn't say that because the mayor has been very uh the mayor and the and the police commissioner and the deputy mayor
for public safety have all been very much um attentive to this problem and the mayor has pushed me and others hard
on sort of what we can do here uh if I may make one public service announcement and this I will say that uh it's very
important that people remember when they sell their car to scrape the sticker take the registration sticker off okay
i'm just saying that actually bigger than ghost plates we've been looking at it with the investigation staff of
oversight and investigations and it's you know selling the license plate out of the back of the car from Virginia and
then all the people who live here who are not from New York uh weren't from New York and they don't change their
license plate it is Virginia i don't know why but I think it's Virginia anyway long story short and I don't see
any public service announcement as you suggest from the state I guess would be or even from you move here you got to
change your license but they don't because those aren't those folks aren't getting there's no reciprocal agreement
so they're not paying either i think we'd be actually happy if you're doing work on this in the in your committee uh
council member we'd be happy to like get together and talk to you about what you're finding and and see if we uh you know brainstorm some thoughts about how
to address this because it's a definitely a a difficult problem to solve okay then I might you know 2.1
billion uh taxes in our paid i know that the controller went through some you
know it's definitely a problem is there anything new about how we can collect some of this 2.1 billion is that
something that is it's everything it's fines it's oath it's these taxes that I these plates I just mentioned
etc i I think one of the biggest challenges here is that
when especially if it's issued against a business uh the business goes out of business or
the business dissolves and reinccorporates in another form it's very hard for us to track down ownership
in that case so I think that's one of the largest reasons why we are unable to
collect on a certain percentage of outstanding business taxes or ECB debt
or other you know or also property based charges like sanitation charges etc um
so that's you know we have a very robust uh collections process i like to say
every now and then that our collections staff brings in more per capita than our audit staff does every year uh they
bring in last year $600 million in collections of outstanding business taxes parking tickets ECB debt so uh you
know we are constantly they're very good they're very managed very well by
assistant commissioner Pam Parker CHO they uh are always innovating and trying
to find programs and and methods to uh help increase our collection rate so do
you hire um consultants to do collection or are you doing it in-house we have outside we have uh I don't remember the
exact number we have nine outside consultant contracts um one for each type of debt
business ECB and parking and we have three uh three agencies for each type
and so for example we'll refer we refer each uh
outstanding debt to the first collection agency and then they have it for six
months then it goes to the second collection agency and then it goes to the third collection agency so you know
we added a third collection agency just last year or two years ago and that uh
has improved our collection rate so so they're making you're making money more
than what you're paying them I assume in terms of collection absolutely all right thank you
okay thank you all very much thank you
okay we will hear from IBO starting at 3:30
okay good afternoon and welcome to the final portion of FY26 budget hearings
day 13 council member Brandon I chair the committee on finance welcome to Director Chaffy and your team thank you
for joining us today uh from the independent New York City independent budget office my questions will largely
focus on IBO's analysis of our uh employment growth the home healthcare
employment federal tax changes business tax forecasts our reserves and state budget risks uh just a reminder we're
only accepting written testimony today after IBO testifies and we ask questions
we will be concluding this hearing so if you wish to submit written testimony for the record you can email it to
testimony@counsel.nyc.gov and you could do that anytime up to 72 hours after the conclusion of today's hearing i'm now
going to turn and we joined still by council members Brewer and Williams thank you for hanging in there with us
we'll now turn it over to committee council Brian Saro to swear you in and we can get started
good afternoon uh do you affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this committee and
to respond honestly to council member questions director Chaffy I do and
officer Subraman subraman yes Subraman i do thank you
okay you me again thank you thank you uh good afternoon um uh Council Finance
Committee Chair Brennan and members of the committee i hope you are enjoying your cookies i'm Louisa Chaffy director
of the Independent Budget Office and I'm joined here today by my colleague Serita Sub Romanian the senior research and
strategy officer we appreciate the opportunity to testify um so we'd like to talk about
the context ibo issued its report on the executive budget and the accompanying
financial plan on May 20th under unusual circumstances which included turmoil at
the federal level including cuts in spending layoffs of uh including cuts in
spending layoffs of staff erratic implementation of tariffs and draconian
immigration issues to name a few and this was further complicated by the
mayor's silence around these and many other issues the absence of a state
enacted budget which caused the city's executive budget to include only placeholder dollar amounts the continued
budget dance by the Adams administration including simultaneous reinstatement of
funding reductions from prior years recognition of the end of co 19 aid and
more under and over budgeting in various categories and all of this is occurring
in a competitive election year our basic findings so ibo's forecast of tax
revenues which is 79.7 billion in 25 and 81 billion in 26
do not vary significantly from OM's forecast in those two years of the financial plan but ibo BO's estimates
savings on the expenditure side of 1.9 billion in 2025 in all these adjustments
net an additional surplus in 25 of 1.7 billion and larger gaps in the rest of
the financial plan window 7.2 billion in 27 7.9 billion in 28 and 7.1 billion in
29 those gaps are on average 7% of city tax revenues this is larger than the
gaps the city has closed in recent years which were around four to six% of city
tax revenues um as you uh the city council
or talk about next steps in negotiating the adop adopted budget IBO suggests
that the city council and the Adams administration weigh how to allocate the current year surplus across two options
one is to use funds to prepay next year's expenses and the second is
placing funds into reserves while prepayment may offer short-term flexibility and offset existing costs it
does not address the root cause of those costs placing funds into reserves
provides more ability to address future shocks and requires the city to address cost overruns in the out years ibo has
identified surplus funds in 2025 meaning that funds could be added to reserves
without decreasing planned spending in the executive budget further exercise of
fiscal discipline with respect to near-term expenses like uniformed overtime could free up additional funds
which could be placed into reserves so we appreciate you keeping in mind that
federal dollars compromise 10.5 billion or 9% of the city's 119 billion bud
dollar budget this year and 7.4 billion or 6% of the budget for
2026 state dollars compromise two 20.7 billion of the city's 2025 budget which
is about 17% and again those amounts are subject to change because the do numbers
were placeholders um in addition to the federal amounts and the state federal
amounts in our budget we also would like to remind you of health and hospitals and the New York City Housing Authority
which are overwhelmingly federally funding dependent new York State's fiscal year 2025 enacted budget of 252
billion included 87 billion in federal funding that's 35% of their total state
budget and the majority of that is Medicaid at about 58% some of the federal funds that are
part of the 17% allocated by the state to the city um are those funds that
support our health and human services now as the US Senate takes up the Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by
the House IBO is paying particular attention to proposed cuts in areas such
as Medicaid supplemental nutrition assistance program and temporary assistance for needy families beyond
impacted programs let's talk about New Yorkers according to the Census Bureau 30% 7% of New York City residents are
foreign born based on the state controllers data close to four million New Yorkers in the city utilize Medicaid
and over 1.6 have health insurance through the essential plan both programs
that are centrally targeted for reduction in January 2025 1.8 million
New Yorkers statewide received benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program totaling over $423
million for that month alone and that's money that kept people fed and supported
New York businesses these are a few examples of people facing potentially
major changes in in the in their central existence food and healthcare due to
federal changes assuming federal legislation
dramatically reduces funding to the state the city will need to convene a special session to account for those
reductions in federal dollars and increased hardship for millions of New
Yorkers this in turn would require the city to consider how to spend how to continue to provide essential services
to vulnerable New Yorkers with that with less funding while maintaining a balanced budget as required by law so
back to our report given this situation IBO emphasizes three takeaways the first
is given the scale of federal funding cuts combined with decisions to slash academic funding implement severe
limitations on immigration and impose huge and erratic tariffs the time to
increase the city's reserve fund is now
two the New York State's policy choices have passed fiscal pressure to the city
only 328 million for child care vouchers was funded approximately 1th3 of the 1
billion requested by the administration in addition New York State's foundation
aid formula resulted in smaller increases for the New York City Department of Education so in addition
to needing to find city funds to accommodate those state choices the time
to increase the city's reserve funds is now lastly this the administration
continues budget practices that increase internal risks these take the form of
underbudgeting whether it be for unifor uniformed overtime which is at 658
million addition in 2026 or the Department of Education's due process cases formerly known as Carter cases for
258 million additional or shelter provision rental and cash assistance
which are collectively at 1.4 four billion in 2026 andor overbudgeting uh
where under the two for one hiring policy the city has quote achieved savings both directly on personnel
924 million25 but also by reducing capacity to spend on other programmatic
funds a continued dependence on prepayment to offset next year's
expenditures and remember the proportion of prepayment continues to shrink yet
each year making this mechanism less and less effective further
um delays in payments on to the nonprofit providers the city controllers estimate um um anticipates over 1
billion currently in unpaid invoices so that's providers under contract without
their bills being paid so again the time to increase the city's reserve funds is
now given these three areas of uncertainty it's hard to describe this
executive budget as the best budget ever thank you for the opportunity to testify
and we are happy to answer any questions thank you very much
um as stated in the your analysis of the financial plan uh IBO expects weaker
employment growth in the city compared to OM's projection so while OM forecasts
about 58,000 more jobs in 2025 fourth quarter to fourth quarter IBO expects an
anemic 32,000 uh more jobs um OMB forecasts
79,000 more jobs in 2026 while IBO expects only 52,000 um your office
explains its weaker employment forecast is partially based on recent data showing a sharp uh decline in tourism
especially international are there any other factors that would suggest weaker job growth than what's uh been projected
by OM well it's it's the last hearing of the
day and we're trying to not be too giddy i'm sure you're feeling the same way but we do we have internally considered
whether there might not be an element of election year optimism involved in some of those numbers sure and I would I
would add that um in general I think the projections for job growth are um you
know slowing substantially across all sectors so um but in particular I think
that's one area where uh our projection differs from what the administration is assuming
so I asked OMB earlier about uh the home healthcare employment and the what the changes to CD CDPAP management will mean
for uh the city's home healthcare job growth does Owen does uh IBO have a
position on that uh yes so we do anticipate um some nearterm growth to
continue although not quite at the pace that it has been historically uh but we do anticipate uh longer term um less
growth for home healthcare because of this CDPAP transition
okay um in your recently released port report you touched on the potential
impact of the proposed uh federal tax changes on city tax revenues and and our
residents uh the report mentions the proposal to limit states use of a pass through entity tax by restricting
certain pass through businesses ability to fully deduct their PTA payments um while the proposed limitation on PET
would not have any impact on city uh state and city personal income tax collection it would raise federal tax
liabilities for city residents who utilize uh PTE are you concerned about
how this proposed limitation would change taxpayer behavior if it were to pass
yes have you done any analysis that that quantifies the potential impact on the
city economy we have not yet uh we will once we have data that's dependent for
let's say 48 hours um okay the business tax forecast ibo is
projecting weaker business tax revenues in the administration about $190 million less this year and 275 million less in
the upcoming fiscal year your report mentions that your forecast is based on April 2025 indicators uh however
economic conditions have certainly shifted since April um with this tariff chaos and uh so-called trade deals and
tax changes um how different would your forecast look if you were to use current economic indicators as we head into June
um I would say that based on the um indicators that have been released since our forecast um we feel um relatively
comfortable with where we're at right now which is that um growth would slow
uh pretty substantially although uh we did not um forecast a recession and so I
would say that likely would be um where we would um forecast if we were to
repeat it now but that is something that we're um continuing to look at and obviously you know as Louisa said news
changes hour to hour so uh we will factor all that in can you summarize the
areas where IBO has identified additional surplus FY24 resources that
that could be used for reserves or prepayment uh yeah so we mentioned as Louisa
mentioned in the testimony um in particular personnel uh costs and so uh
we estimate uh over 900 million there um we also are projecting lower costs for
asylum seekers uh we project uh we because a lot of the population is now
in DHS as opposed to um health and hospitals we are projecting um slower
costs uh or decreased costs um to align more closely with um DHS shelter costs
for those asylum seekers so those are two areas um that we noted in the report
i would say another area that we have thought about um are other than personnel service costs um and that's an
area that uh you know is largely uh if it's not spent by this time in the year
um is an area where the city could look to um you know get additional savings
without um direct service uh in interference so there's often a fair
amount of cushion built into basic things like paper and supplies and chairs etc and this is the quarter where
that kind of money could be um in effect redeployed without great impact to any
level of operations uh I asked OM if they could give us an
estimate of what they think the hiring freeze had quote unquote saved us do do you have any analysis on
that m okay no no not not currently and
lastly what areas within the state budget do you does IBO see as the big the biggest risks to our budget
well we outlined the childcare vouchers and the foundation aid um yeah I would
say those uh as well as you know Medicaid um as Louisa mentioned is one
that we um are looking to see in particular um assuming that the approval
to the transition from um the indigent care um pricing to uh the direct uh
directed payment um it will not be approved uh we're looking to see what actions uh the state might take in terms
of uh going back to session to um allow for ICP to be to continue um and then
obviously the um the announcement about the um the waiver um you know being
taken back and that also being implemented on a pace that's um a lot faster than what would traditionally
happen um and that you know normally I think uh the federal government in those circumstances would give states you know
longer of time frame to adjust and it sounds like that'll be about 6 months for the state so
what do you guys think of the mayor's bit bond idea oh we're so glad you asked um we surprisingly IBO was not consulted
in advance do you think the city of New York should have have anything to do with investing
in crypto or Bitcoin uh so we would defer to the controllers's advice in that circumstance okay my colleagues
have any questions council member Brewer thank you um I know I always ask the same question but um I know you did an
analysis a while ago of those taxes and parking fines and so on that could not be collected i just didn't know there
was any update i've asked others about it and it's I think everybody's trying and the finance has got I think nine
collection agencies and staff trying but I just didn't know if you've done any updated on that topic uh we have not yet
done an updated analysis okay and the other question I have is with the um
when you you did such a great analysis here of the state and federal u and the
exact numbers as to what is or is not there um I know this is a hard question
but how do you think or when do you think when would it be appropriate for the city to make some decisions about
this obviously between now and the end of June I assume you might say but how are we going to how do you look at this
federal cut um so we suggest to add money to the reserves in advance of what
we believe to be severe federal cuts but we also recognize that the new acronym
Taco may apply on some level and uh that there may be far less but then
better to have reserves and be able to deploy them in future years and other ways um if this process goes through as
anticipated as outlined in the testimony we would expect um the state shortly
after the Senate finishes to have to go into special session and that the city
quite quickly after that would then also need to um adjust its um anticipated
expenditures so that probably by November decisions will have been made and that's when the feds will know more
too that they're what we're doing with Um in terms of education um is there anything that you could add because of
your expertise there in terms of education either from what the state did or didn't give us or from um you know
what could happen in in Washington and we're obviously concerned about the two billion we're concerned in my situation
about the migrants um I would love them to stay in the Department of Education i
feel so strongly about that i just was wondering if there's anything you want to add about education uh yeah so I
would um agree with you on um particularly funds for um immigrant
students so title three um is something that we're paying close attention to um
in terms of the uh you know the additional costs we project for education i think class size uh remains
to be the one cost um that we anticipate especially in 27 and out years um I know
I know the department has added some funds and we're um working to update our estimate of that uh as well um but I I
think actually what's uh unique about our analysis this time is that um you
know the the challenges in ACS with the child care vouchers are trumping a lot of the um additional education um costs
that we're estimating so I would say childcare vouchers is a really critical area right obviously the state put in
money it's not clear even though we heard earlier that it's there it's not completely clear what the city's putting
in terms of uh vouchers for the uh housing
yeah that came up in the sense that we have X dollars uh I think that the DSS
commissioner indicated that she uh is you know feels we'll save $11 million
but there's a concern that people um have to pay more for their voucher and
so they may end up going back to shelter that's what the nonprofits think is that
something that you've looked at in terms of what the future could be for those with housing vouchers uh we did not
factor that into um our estimate um so but that is something that would
certainly um make uh an impact in terms of uh the number of vouchers that are
issued right okay thank you Council Member Williams thank you um I
know I've spoken to you about this already but budget equity and I look forward to figuring out how um we could
look into this from your office and I know you were here when Department of
Finance testified around the parking tickets so from your vantage point do
you believe there are ways to assess how we are both generating revenue and
spending money based off of um different demographics and geographical locations
in New York City and does Ibo in their work look at this in any of their
assessments or reports um so to date we have not looked at a
geographic spread or um the geographic v variation of collections of fees and
fines although as councilwoman Brewer um referred to we have been looking really closely at the total and where they're
coming from and and what has and has not been collected um but we would be happy to investigate this area further thank
you yes I look forward to us doing that i have a lots of ideas um Department of Sanitation is another place and our
deputy speaker has been mentioning that a lot in the hearings around not being able to assess or understand how
Department of Sanitation chooses to allocate said funds to different garages
um so yes I look forward to talking to you more about this the other question I have because you were very clear that
this is a great time to put money into the reserves I'm glad you understood And again I'm sure you were listening to
OMB's hearing earlier and um Jacques said something very interesting he said
two things that I thought was interesting one thing he said was um essentially they don't want to tip the
city's hand right they don't want to give off this this impression that you know we have the money and we can deal
with cuts um and then he also kind of alluded to this idea that it kind of
doesn't matter if we put things in reserve funds because there's no way that the city could um cover any type of
potential federal loss so how do you kind of explain uh and further double down on the need
to put away money in the reserve funds because I think he was again clear on two things like one this idea of like we
don't want to um create this narrative that could be used against us but then
this other thing that I kind of took from it was like it doesn't really matter because we don't have enough
money anyway to be able to fill in the gap
um uh uh as nobody knows what the gap is um it would be very hard to pretend that
we have enough money to fill in the gap so our recommendation to add money to
reserves is simply to have money to lessen the blows when they come uh we
are not under the impression that the Trump administration is perusing the city's reserve funds as they make
decisions about uh immigration policy or cuts to human services or changes to
academic funding in New York City which then resolve in lesser tax collections
and the many other policy changes that are being made perhaps director Xiha has more insight as to what the Trump is
administration is considering as they make their policy changes i would also add that uh you know I
think one thing we point out is that um our estimates for example um you know
uniformed overtime do assume the same level of expenditure year-over-year and
that's one area that we've identified could be you know if if better management practices were put in place
those costs uh would be lower and that would um reduce the the gap in the
future so um and again with some of these areas of um additional savings
that we highlighted um could also affect uh or bring down that gap right and I'm
actually going to build on what my colleague just said so um as Serita mentioned one thing that is unusual in
many of the federal changes right now is that they are being enacted immediately or close to
immediately generally they're stepdowns in time and when a a government is
making reduction choices it recognizes that for example uh partners like in the
nonprofit community providing services who are obliged to lessen need to have
time to meaningfully reduce those services so that the employees and the clients can be as best taken care of so
money in reserves could lessen how much is reduced andor allow for a time for a
reasonable close down as opposed to doing it in say 30 days which is what city contracts basically allow thank you
and what do you feel is the appropriate size for the reserve fund
um well what a wonderful question uh so we have debated this question amply
internally um and we are quite sure that more is better um we don't really know
we don't feel that there's a general number and the reality is there's no number that the city could set aside that would genuinely compensate for what
might be cut but I'm going to give a couple different um ideas uh best
practices of household management financial management and the city's budget is not a household but just a a
vague equivalent is to have about six months um of general sa spending on in
savings now as um Councilman Brandon knows because of the request of what does it cost to operate the city for a
day you basically take the city budget divide it by 365 and there's each day's cost uh so that is significantly more
money than we believe could be found to be put into reserves another Do you have
a dollar amount of that cuz we have six months how much would it cost us to run
the city for six months half of 119 billion yeah like 50 billion okay yeah
so another another thing to think about is that six months of the city's payroll
is about 25 billion um right now we have give or take 2 to 8 billion in reserves
so you know just we're just we don't have an answer but we're trying to think about generally what might be a better
target and when do you think it's appropriate to draw down from the reserve fund
when it's raining really hard thank you
thank you very much Ibo appreciate all you guys do thank you thank you
okay with that FY26 executive budget hearings is done thank you very much
everybody
